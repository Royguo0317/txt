## 川普總統在新聞發佈會上的講話摘要（2020.08.15）
`2020-08-19 07:37 GM31` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hant/302809/)

川普總統在2020年8月15日的新聞發佈會上提到，我們的重點是積極保護高風險的老人。他還敦促大家採取常識性緩解措施。美國有新冠病例急劇下降。我們的測試超過了歐盟總計7,000多萬例測試的總和。我們的股票市場幾乎處於歷史高位。



THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. And thank you for being here. Let me provide a brief update on the China virus, as well as our economic recovery, which is going really very well, as you probably have been hearing.

總統：謝謝，非常感謝，感激。謝謝你們的出席。讓我簡要更新一下**中國病毒**以及我們的經濟復蘇情況。正如您可能聽到的一樣，一切進展的非常好。

Nearly 85 percent of jurisdictions all across our country are reporting a very steep decline in cases, and that’s despite the fact that we have the number one testing program anywhere in the world. We’re up to almost 70 million tests, far beyond any other country. This week, cases nationwide have declined by 6 percent; the test positivity rate has fallen to just 6.5 percent, a 71 percent reduction from April and a 15 percent reduction from mid-July. That’s a big reduction. The hospitalization rate for the virus has been reduced by half since April.

儘管我們有世界上排名第一的檢測程式（檢測的最多），但全國有將近85%的司法管轄區報告的病例數量急劇下降。我們有接近7000萬次的測試，遠遠超過其它任何國家。本周，全國病例下降了6%；測試結果為陽性率降至6.5%，比4月份降低了71%，比7月中旬降低了15%。這是一個大幅的減少。自四月份以來，該病毒（導致）的住院率降低了一半。

And I urge everyone to apply commonsense mitigation. We know that. And we are all doing that, and I want to thank the American people for really doing such a great job.

我敦促大家採取常識性的緩解措施。我們知道這點，並且都在這樣做。我要感謝美國人民的出色工作。

The United States has now administered over 70 million tests, more than all of the European Union combined. If you combine all of Europe, it’s less than what we do. Millions of point-of-care tests are processed in less than 24 hours and many in under 15 minutes. Nearly 80 percent of all commercial lab test results are now returned within three days. So we’ve gotten that number down from about eight days to three days, and that’s only in the longer-term lab cases. But we have many 15- minute tests; we have some 5-minute tests. The turnaround time for federal surge testing sites is just two days. So when you send them out, despite the fact that you have a delivery time, which you can’t do anything about, it’s all the way down to two days. That’s a very substantial reduction. Great job by the people that do it.

美國現在已經進行了超過7000萬次的測試，超過了整個歐盟的總和。如果你們將整個歐盟合在一起，它們的測試比我們做的少。不到24個小時，（我們就）可以處理數百萬個即時檢測，許多即時檢測可以在15分鐘之內出結果。現在，近80%的商業實驗室的檢測在三天內出結果。因此，我們已經將這個數字從大約八天減到了三天，而且這只是在長期實驗室的病例中。但是，我們有許多15分鐘的測試；我們有一些5分鐘的測試。聯邦激增（新冠爆發時增加的）測試點（federal surge testing sites）的周轉期僅為兩天。因此，即使有一定的遞送時間 （儘管你們無法做任何事情（來改善）），當你將其發送出去的時候，整個過程只需要兩天。這是一個非常可觀的減少。做這項工作的人做的非常好。

We are focused on aggressively shielding the highest-risk individuals. Those living in nursing homes and long-term care facilities are less than 1 percent of the U.S. population but account for nearly half of all fatalities. That’s an incredible thing. So it’s 1 percent of the U.S. population but they account for nearly half of the fatalities from the China virus. That’s why we have rushed nursing home funding, protective gear, and rapid testing equipment. And we will announce additional measures to protect nursing home residents.

我們正專注於積極保護（面臨）最高風險的個人。住在療養院和長期護理機構中的人占美國人口的比例小於1%，但是幾乎占所有死亡人數的一半。那是不可思議的事情。因此，**這是1%的美國人口，但是將近占了中國病毒死亡人數的一半**。因此， 我們急需養老院資金，防護裝備，以及快速測試設備。我們將會宣佈其他加上的措施來保護療養院居民。

In the coming days, we’ve worked very hard with nursing home companies and also with the governors — 50 governors all around the United States — and we have developed a very good relationship with most of the governors. And I think, for the most part, they’re doing a really good job. They’re focused very heavily on nursing homes. And when they need equipment that they can’t get — remember, they’re supposed to get it, but when they can’t get, we have tremendous amounts of equipment in stock.

在接下來的幾天裡，我們與療養院公司以及州長（全美50個州長）進行了非常努力的合作，並且與大多數州長建立了良好的關係。而且我認為，在大多數情況下，他們的工作做的非常好。他們非常重視療養院。當他們需要他們無法獲得的設備的時候—記住，他們應該得到，但是當他們不能獲得的時候，我們有大量的設備庫存。

Thanks to my administration’s decisive action to save American jobs, we’re currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history. And that’s because the foundation that we set previously, before the virus came and hit our shore — the foundation was so strong; we had such a strong foundation that we’re recovering much faster than anybody anticipated. It turns out that it will be a very, very strong “V,” and you’ll see that in just a second.

由於我的行政機構為挽救美國工作而採取的果斷行動，我們目前目睹了美國歷史上最快的經濟復蘇。那是因為在病毒來襲之前，我們之前建立的基礎非常牢固；我們擁有堅實的基礎，因此（經濟）恢復速度比任何人預期的都要快。事實證明，這將是非常非常尖的“V” 型恢復，你們很快就會看到。

So retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an all-time high. That’s not all time for this month or last month; that’s at an all-time high, and you see that with the chart. This was previous to the — the plague, I call it — the plague coming into our land, and really affected 188 — dealing with 188 countries.

所以，零售支出已經完全恢復，而且目前處於歷史最高水準。這不僅是本月或上個月的所有時間，而是歷史最高水準。你們可以從圖表中看到。這發生在瘟疫（我稱之為瘟疫）入侵我們的領土之前，並且確實影響了188個，涉及188個國家。

And if you see, we’ve not only recovered but we’re at a much higher level than we were even then. That’s an incredible number that nobody thought would even be possible. So we’re currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history. That’s an amazing statement.

而且，如果你們明白的話，我們不僅已經恢復，而且已經處於比那時更高的水準。這是一個令人難以置信的數字，沒人會想到這會成為一個可能。因此，我們目前正目睹美國歷史上最快的經濟復蘇。這是一個了不起的聲明。

So retail spending is great, and now, if they would put up, auto production has surged 28 percent, and that’s your auto production, which is right there. (A chart is displayed.) So you’ll see that that’s now about even to where it was, and that was at an all-time record high, and we’re already even.

所以，零售支出很好，現在，如果他們願意製造，汽車生產將猛增28%，這就是你們的汽車生產，就在那裡（顯示了一個圖表）。所以，你們將會看到它現在甚至達到了原來的水準，並且那是有史以來的最高紀錄，而我們已經達到了。

And if you had a chart for used cars, you’d see that used car sales are setting a record, and that’s great for production because when the used cars are practically not available — they’re very, very tight — that means you’re going to make a lot of new cars. So that number is going to go up even beyond what it is right now, but that’s a fantastic number. That’s a number that’s the equivalent of where it was, and that was a record.

而且，如果你們有二手車的圖表，你們會發現二手車銷售量創下了記錄。這對於生產而言，非常有用，因為當二手車幾乎不可獲得的時候 （它們非常緊缺），這就意味著你們要生產許多新車。因此，這個數字甚至會超過現在的水準，但這是一個了不起的數字。這個數字等同於它之前所在的水準，並且是一個記錄。

So you see what’s happening with respect to the economy and the recovery. And the stock market is almost at an all-time high. In fact, NASDAQ is at an all-time high. It’s had 14 days where we broke the record already over the last two months. So a lot of great things are happening.

所以，你們可以瞭解在經濟和復蘇方面到底發生了什麼。股市幾乎處於歷史最高水準。事實上，納斯達克（綜合指數）已經達到歷史最高水準。在過去兩個月中，我們已經有14天打破紀錄。所以，很多偉大的事情正在發生。

Through the historic relief package that I signed into law, we saved over 50 million American jobs — 50 million American jobs — and the unemployment rate is rapidly going down. You see that. You’ve seen that. And I think you’ll see it over the next two months, and you’ll have a good report even prior to the election. You’re going to have a very good report. I think you’re going to have an incredible GDP. You’re going to have a tremendous report on business, and a lot of it’s going to be released — which is very fortunate — prior to the election.

通過我簽署成為法律的具有歷史意義的救濟計畫（relief package），我們已經挽救了5000萬個美國工作崗位—5000萬個美國工作崗位—失業率正在迅速下降。你們看到了，你們已經看到了。我認為在接下來的兩個月內，你們會看到，你們甚至會在選舉前看到一份很不錯的報告。你們將會看到一份很好的報告。我認為你們將會看到令人難以置信的GDP。你們將會看到關於商業的極好的報告，而且許多將會在選舉前發佈。這是多麼幸運。

I think the Democrats are going out of their way to try and do whatever they can to stop these kind of numbers. They don’t like these kind of numbers because they think it’ll hurt them in the election. I think we all have to pull together and we have to do the right job, and we have to do what’s — what’s good for the American people.

我認為民主黨正在竭盡全力去阻止這些數字。他們不喜歡這些數字，因為他們認為這會在選舉中傷害他們。我認為我們所有人必須團結一致，我們必須做正確的事情，我們必須做對美國人民有利的事情。

We were unfairly treated by China because they could have stopped it. With that being said, China has purchased the most amount of corn in history. They — last week, they purchased the two largest days in the history of corn purchase and a massive amount of soybeans. Also cattle.

**我們受到中國不公平的對待，因為他們本可以阻止它。話雖如此，中國已經購買了歷史上最多的玉米。上周，他們購買了有史以來玉米購買量最大的兩天，以及大量的的大豆，還有牛。**

So China has been buying a lot of — a lot of things, and they’re doing that to keep me happy, but they’re dreaming about Joe Biden. They would love to have that happen, but I don’t think that’s going to happen. They are dreaming about him and so is Iran — dreaming about Joe — and so are numerous other countries. They dream about it because if that happens, they’ll own the United States. And China, I can tell you, specifically, will own the United States. Can’t let that happen.

**所以，中國一直在買很多—很多東西。他們這麼做是為了讓我開心，但是他們夢想的是喬拜登。他們希望發生這種情況，但我不認為這將會發生。他們夢想的是喬拜登，伊朗也是—想到的是喬拜登—其他許多國家也是如此。他們夢想這些，因為如果發生這種情況的話，他們將會擁有美國。我可以告訴你，特別是中國將會擁有美國。不能讓這種事情發生。**

If you remember, China had the worst — the worst year they’ve had in 67 years prior to the plague coming to our shores. And we are now starting to do really well. We’re going to have a very good third quarter, maybe a great third quarter. And we’re going to have an incredible next year, unless somebody comes up and quadruples taxes, which is what they’re talking about doing.

**如果你還記得的話，在這場瘟疫侵襲我們之前,中國經歷了67年以來最糟糕的一年。我們現在開始做的非常好。我們將會有一個很好的第三季度，也許是一個很棒的第三季度。明年，我們將取得令人難以置信的成績，除非有人來增加四倍的稅，這就是他們正在討論要做的事情。**

And also, regulations we’ve set — we’ve done more in terms of cutting regulations than any administration in history by far, whether it was four years or eight years or, in one case, more than eight years. We have, in less than four years, done more regulation cutting by far. And we’re doing more as we — as we go. Some of it is statutory; you can only do it at a certain pace. You have to wait 90 days, you have to wait 120 days before you can take the next step. We have tremendous regulation cutting coming. With that being said, we’re going to have certain regulations to protect the environment and also safety.

而且，我們已經制定了法規—在消減法規方面，我們做的比迄今為止的任何政府都要多，無論是四年還是八年任職，或者甚至超過八年。在不到四年的時間裡，我們目前已經完成了更多的法規消減（工作）。隨著（工作）推進，我們將會做更多。其中一些是法定的，（因此）你只能以一定的速度進行操作。你必須等90天，你必須等120天才可以執行下一個步驟。我們將會有大量的法規消減。話雖如此，我們將會出臺一些法規來保護環境和安全。

Small business optimism has come surging back. In June, it was higher than any month under the previous administration. Think of that. So small business optimism was higher than any month under the previous administration. And that is while we’re going through a pandemic, a worldwide pandemic, you have a number like that. And when you see the numbers that we quoted just now as to what’s happening with cases and all of the other hospitalization rates, a lot of tremendous things are happening.

小型企業的樂觀情緒又回來了。在六月份，它（這股樂觀情緒）高於上屆政府執政的任何月份。想想看。因此，小型企業的樂觀情緒高於上屆執政政府的任何一個月。而且，這發生在我們正在經歷大流行的時候，一個世界範圍內的大流行的時候，你們有這樣的數字。當你看到我們剛才引用的病例數字，以及其他住院率數位時，許多極好的事情正在發生。

Industrial production is increasing at the fastest rate ever recorded. I mean, think of these numbers. I mean, how does that happen? Industrial production is increasing at the fastest rate on record, which is “ever recorded.”

工業生產正在以有史以來最快的速度增長。我的意思是，想想這些數字。我的意思是，這是怎麼發生的？工業生產正以有史以來最快的速度增長，這是有記錄的。

Consumer spending is expected to grow at an astronomical rate this quarter. So we don’t have the number yet, but it looks like it’s going to be at an astronomical rate.

本季度消費者支出預計會以天文數字增長。所以，我們目前還沒有這個數字，但是看起來它將會是一個天文數字。

I want to say that I want college football to come back. These are strong, healthy, incredible people. These are people that want to play football very badly. A great, great talent quarterback, Trevor Lawrence, called me two days ago. I spoke to him a couple of times. And he said, “Sir, I want to just tell you we want it back, we want to play.” And he’s an incredible quarterback, as you know, from an incredible school, Clemson. And he’s going to have a very good future in the NFL. He’s got everything. He’s got height, accuracy, a strong arm, and he’s fast. Other than that, I guess he’s got some problems. (Laughter.) But he’s got — he’s got the whole package. I watched him last year running. He was faster than — faster than the backs that were guarding. I think he’s going to be great.

我想說的是，我希望大學橄欖球回來。他們是堅強、健康，不可思議的人。這些人非常想打橄欖球。兩天前，一位偉大的、出色的四分衛特雷弗·勞倫斯（Trevor Lawrence）打電話給我。我跟他聊過幾次。他說：“先生，我只想告訴你，我們想要它回來，我們想要打球。” 正如你所知，他是一位來自極好的學校-克萊姆森大學的出色的四分衛。他將在國家職業橄欖球聯盟（NFL）中擁有非常好的未來。他具備了一切。他有身高、準確性、強壯的手臂，以及速度。除此之外，我想他也有一些問題。但是，他已經擁有—他已經具備一切。去年，我看到過他跑步。他（的速度）比後衛還快。我認為他會很棒。

But he’s just a great young man. I talked to him actually for a long time. They want to play football. And he made the statement that he feels he’s safer on the field. He’s safer on the field than he is out — you know, outside of the field. He feels very safe.

但是，他只是一個了不起的年輕人。我實際上和他談了很久。他們想打橄欖球。他說他感覺他在運動場上比在外面更安全—你們知道，運動場之外。他感覺非常安全。

And if you look, the SEC, the Big 12, and the ACC are back. They want to come back, and I think they’re coming back. The Big 10 and the Pac 12 are not, and I wish they would come back.

如果你看一下，東南聯盟 （the SEC）、12大聯盟（the Big 12），以及大西洋海岸聯盟（the ACC）都回來了。它們想要回來，我想它們正在回來。10大聯盟（the Big 10）和太平洋12（Pac 12）還沒有回來，我希望它們能回來。

And, you know, I just want to say — it’s sort of sad because I’d been fighting for football to come back. We’re trying to help the NFL, as long as they stand for our National Anthem, as long as they honor our flag and our country. If they start kneeling, I’m not going to be helping them much. They might come back, but I won’t be watching. Neither will a lot of other people.

而且，你們知道，我只想說—有點可悲，因為我一直在努力爭取橄欖球回來。我們會努力幫助國家職業橄欖球聯盟，只要他們支持我們的國歌，只要他們尊重我們的國旗和國家。如果他們開始跪下，我不會對他們有太大幫助。他們可能會回來，但是我不會看。許多其他人也不會看。

I think what the NBA did was atrocious. I thought it was disgraceful the way they kneeled. And their ratings are reflective of that. But I think football has to get smart. That’s the NFL; let’s see what happens. But if they do it — they learned their lesson, I thought, two years ago when people started not watching and when people really weren’t going to the game so much. A lot of empty seats all of a sudden. So they’re going to learn that lesson again if they don’t wise up.

我認為國家籃球協會（NBA）的行為是殘酷的。我認為他們跪下（的行為）是可恥的。他們的評分反映了這一點。但是，我認為橄欖球球員必須變得聰明。那是國家職業橄欖球聯盟；讓我們看看會發生什麼。但是，如果他們這樣做了—我認為，兩年前當人們開始不看（比賽），當人們實際上並沒有那麼想去參加比賽的時候，他們已經得到了教訓。突然間有很多空座位。所以，如果他們不明智的話，他們會再次接受教訓。

But I just want to say — so, Trevor Lawrence, great. And some of the great people — SEC, Big 12, ACC — I want to thank them and I want to congratulate them for coming back.

但是，我只想說—特雷弗·勞倫斯很棒。還有一些很棒的人—東南聯盟、12大聯盟，以及大西洋海岸聯盟—我想要感謝他們，並祝賀他們又開始比賽。

I want to also mention that CNN had a story that, “Will they blame Trump for football in the swing states?” What a dishonest story that is. Will they blame me? I’m the one that’s pushing them to come back. So they want to try and blame me. So them and, I guess, the New York Times reported one person — it was one person in the story — one person said maybe it’s Trump’s fault. And I’m the one pushing them back.

我還要提及的是，CNN有一個故事說：“在搖擺州，他們會將橄欖球歸咎於川普嗎？”多麼不誠實的故事。他們會歸咎於我嗎？我是那個促使他們回來的人。所以，他們想要嘗試責怪我？所以，他們和《紐約時報》（我猜想）報導了一個人—故事中只有一個人—一個人說有可能這是川普的錯。我是那個幫助他們重新開賽的人。

So I’d like to see college football come back. I’d like to see them come back proud and strong. I was very impressed by Trevor. I was very impressed by other people that called me. Players called me, coaches called me — Coach O. If you want a coach who’s central casting for a movie — if you’re doing a movie, you have to put Coach O as the head because this guy is central casting.

所以，我想看到大學橄欖球回來。我想看到他們驕傲且堅強的回來。特雷弗給我留下了深刻的印象。打電話給我的其他人也給我留下了深刻的印象。運動員叫我O教練，教練也叫我O教練。如果你想要教練是電影的中心演員—如果你正在拍一部電影，你必須以O教練 為首，因為這個人是中心演員。

But when you have guys like Nick Saban and others calling for it to come back — they want it to come back. And these are great athletes. These are not people that seem to be at all susceptible to this horrible disease. And they want to play football. And we have great testing, so you’ll be able to test.

但是，當有像尼克·薩班（Nick Saban）這樣的人或者其他人呼籲它回來的時候—他們想要它回來。他們是偉大的運動員。他們似乎並不容易感染這個可怕的疾病。而且，他們想要打橄欖球。我們有出色的測試，所以，你們應該可以進行測試。

And when CNN and the New York Times — the New York Times quoted one person — one person. And I’m the one pushing. So we’ll get it straight: I’m the one pushing for football to come back. I think if I wasn’t pushing, you wouldn’t have anything happening.

當有線新聞網（CNN）和《紐約時報》—《紐約時報》引用一個人—一個人時，我是推動者。所以，我們將直截了當：我是推動橄欖球回歸的那個人。我認為如果我不推動的話，你們將不會有任何事情發生。

So, with that, we’ll take — we’ll take a few questions. Steve, please.

接下來，我們將回答—回答一些問題。

Q Mr. President, thank you. The U.S. effort to extend the Iran arms embargo at the U.N. Security Council —

問：總統先生，謝謝。美國為擴大聯合國安理會的伊朗武器禁運所做的努力—

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.

總統：是的。

Q — fell apart yesterday. When will you trigger a snapback of sanctions on Iran?

問：—昨天分崩離析。您什麼時候會發動對伊朗的制裁回彈？

THE PRESIDENT: Well, we knew what the vote was going to be but we’ll be doing a snapback. You’ll be watching it next week.

總統：好，我們知道投票將會是什麼樣的，不過我們將要進行回彈。下周你將會看到。

So, with that, we’ll take — we’ll take a few questions. Steve, please.

Q Will it be soon?

問：這將會很快嗎？

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, you’ll be watching it next week.

總統：是的。下周你會看到。

Q And if I could follow up: President Putin wants to hold a video summit —

問：如果我可以跟進（問題）：普京總統想要舉行一次視頻峰會—

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.

總統：是的。

Q — on this subject.

問：—關於這個問題的。

THE PRESIDENT: He has asked.

總統：他問過。

Q Are you wanting to do that? Will you participate?

問：您想要這麼做嗎？您會參加嗎？

THE PRESIDENT: Probably not. No, I think we want to wait until after the election. Look, Iran wants me to lose so badly, because if they do — you know, Iran is a whole different ballgame right now. They haven’t been sponsoring terror because they don’t have very much money to sponsor terror, and they know we just captured four Iranian ships, as you know, and we brought them into Houston. They were going to Venezuela; they’re not supposed to be doing that. Iran would love to have me defeated.

總統：可能不會。不，我認為我們想要等到選舉之後。瞧，伊朗非常想要我輸，伊朗現在是一個完全不同的狀況。他們之所以沒有資助恐怖活動是因為他們沒有足夠的錢來資助他們，而且他們知道我們剛剛捕獲了四艘伊朗船隻，並把這些船隻放在了休斯頓。這些船隻打算去委內瑞拉；他們本不應該那樣做。伊朗很想打敗我。

If I win, which I hope to win — how can you not when you see numbers like this, both on the virus and on the economy? I mean, we should win. We should all be — keep this incredible thing going. And I built it once and I’ll build it again. I’ve already — I think the hardest part is done in terms of the economy. And that’s with or without additional funds from Nancy Pelosi. They should have put the things in — whether you call it the CARE Act or phase one, phase two, phase three — but they didn’t do that. You know, they put it at the end, things that they’re asking for that have nothing to do with corona, that have everything to do with radical-left politics.

如果我贏了，我希望我可以贏—在看到這樣的數字時，無論是在病毒方面還是在經濟方面，你怎麼可能不贏？我的意思是，我們應該贏。我們都應該讓這不可思議的事情繼續下去。我曾經創建過一次輝煌，而且我會再創建一次。我已經—我認為經濟方面最難的部分已經完成，不管有沒有南茜佩洛西的額外資金。他們本應該把這些事情放入—不管是你們所謂的關懷法案（the CARE Act），還是第一階段，第二階段，第三階段—但是他們沒有這麼做。你們知道，他們將這個放在最後，他們要求的事情跟處理疫情沒有任何關係，但是跟激進左翼政治息息相關。

Q Mr. President, more than 40 states received letters from your Postal Service saying that the ballots for November 3rd might not make it in time.

問：總統先生，40多個州收到了來自您的郵政服務的信件稱11月3日的投票可能無法及時進行。

THE PRESIDENT: Well, we’ll see.

總統：我們拭目以待。

Q As President, isn’t it your responsibility, since this is your Postal Service, to meet this critical need?

問：作為總統，您是否有責任來滿足這些關鍵需求，因為這是您的郵政服務？

THE PRESIDENT: Well, we have a man in there for two months. He’s a very talented man. He’s a brilliant business person. He’s done great. He’s a very nice man also. And he — Louis — he is working very hard.

總統：我們有一個人在那裡待了兩個月了。他是一位很有才華的人。他是一位出色的商人。他做的很好。他也是一位很好的人。而且，他—路易士（Louis）—他工作非常努力。

But as you know, the Democrats aren’t approving the proper funding for Postal, and they’re not approving the proper funding for this ridiculous thing that they want to do, which is all mail-in voting. “Universal,” you could call it, mail-in voting.

但是，正如你們所知，民主黨人沒有為郵政（服務）批准適當的資金，而且他們也沒有為他們想做的這個荒謬的事情（也就是郵寄投票）批准適當的資金。你可以稱呼“通用”或者郵寄投票。

Again, absentee voting is great. You request — I’m an absentee voter because I requested, I got, and then I sent in my vote. So that works out very well. That’s what we’ve had. But now they want to send in millions and millions of ballots. And you see what’s happening. They’re being lost, they’re being discarded. They’re finding them in piles. It’s going to be a catastrophe. So — and this is beyond the Post Office.

同樣，缺席投票非常重要。你要求—我是缺席投票，因為我要求了，我（被）准許了，然後我遞送投票。這樣做效果很好。這是我們已經經歷的。但是現在，他們想要投遞數以百萬計的選票。你會看到發生什麼。它們丟失了，被丟棄了。它們會堆積如山。這將會成為一場災難。所以—這超出了郵局（的能力範圍）。

But Louis DeJoy is working very hard. The Post Office has, for decades, lost billions and billions of dollars. I read numbers today that are unthinkable. And what they want to do now is hit the Post Office with millions of ballots from certain states. And if you look at what happened in New York and Virginia and various other places, it’s a catastrophe. They’re losing 20 percent of the votes. Nobody knows what’s happened.

但是，路易士·德喬伊（Louis DeJoy）工作非常努力。幾十年以來，郵局已經損失了數十億元。我今天讀了一些令人難以想像的數字。他們現在想要做的是在某些州的郵局投遞數百萬張選票。如果你看看紐約和維吉尼亞，以及其他各個地方發生的情況，那是一場災難。它們失去了20%的選票。沒人知道發生了什麼。

So we’re going to see what happens. But I do say this: Universal mail-in voting is going to be catastrophic. It’s going to make our country a laughingstock all over the world. You can’t send out millions of ballots.

所以，我們將看看會發生什麼。但是我確實是這樣說：通用郵寄投票將會是災難性的。這將會使我們的國家成為全世界的笑柄。你不可能郵寄出數百萬張選票。

And look at all of the tests. Look, you’ve seen them, and there are many. Far more — just look at New York. Look at New Jersey. Look at the catastrophe in New Jersey. And New Jersey had more than just Paterson. Look at what’s going on in Virginia. Look at what’s happening with this mail-in voting. It’s a disgrace. Absentee is good; mail-in, universal is very, very bad. There’s no way they’re going to get it accurately. They’re off by 20 and 30 percent. And this is beyond Post Office.

看看所有的測試。瞧，你已經看過了，而且有很多。更重要的是—看看紐約。看看新澤西。看看新澤西的大災難。新澤西有的不僅僅是Paterson. 看看發生在維吉尼亞的事情，看看這些郵寄投票的情況。這是一個恥辱。缺席者（郵寄投票）很好；通用郵寄（投票）非常非常不好。它們不可能獲得準確的（選票）。選票下降了20%和30%。而且，這超出了郵局的能力範圍。

Now, with that being said, they want money for the universal mail-in ballots, and they’re not getting it. You know why? Because of them. We want money to go to people. They want money in order to bail out states that have done very poorly. The states that have done poorly, you know them as well as I do, these are run by Democrats, usually radical-left Democrats.

現在，他們需要金錢（來實施）通用郵寄投票，但是他們沒有得到資金。你們知道為什麼嗎？因為他們。我們想要把金錢投資給人們。他們想要金錢來救助那些表現的很差的州。這些表現很差的州（你和我都知道這些州）是由民主黨運行的，通常是激進左翼民主黨人掌控的。

You take a look at what’s happening in Portland. And we’ll go into Portland — we have to be asked — we’ll go into Portland, straighten it out in one hour, like happened in Minneapolis. We’ll go straighten it out in one hour. We will straighten it out so fast, but they have to ask us.

你們可以看看波特蘭發生了什麼。我們將討論波特蘭—我們必須被問到—我們將探究波特蘭，在一小時內將其理順，就像發生在明尼阿波利斯一樣。我們將在一小時內理順。我們會如此之快的理順，但是他們必須要求我們。

So they need money, but they’re not willing to approve the money that they need. If they can’t get the money that they need for universal mail-in voting, I don’t see how they can have it. And that’s not only Post Office, it’s also for the voting itself.

因此，它們（郵局）需要資金，但是民主黨不願意批准它們需要的資金。如果郵局不能獲得通用郵寄投票所需要的資金，我不明白它們能如何獲得。而且，這不僅僅是郵局，也是為了投票本身。

Q A follow on that, Mr. President. Does Postmaster DeJoy have your backing for the actions that he’s taken in the last several days?

問：總統先生，郵政局長DeJoy在最近幾天採取的行動是否得到您的支持？

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. He’s a fantastic man.

總統：是的。他是一個了不起的人。

Q Does that include removing —

問：那是不是包括搬走—

THE PRESIDENT: He wants to — he wants to make the Post Office great again. Do you ever hear the expression? He wants to make the Post Office great again.

總統：他想要—他想要使郵局再創輝煌。你曾聽到過這個表達嗎？他想要使郵局再創輝煌。

Q So you support removing 10 percent of —

問：所以，您失去了10%的支持者—.

THE PRESIDENT: The Post Office is a catastrophe.

Q — mail-sorting machines nationwide? That’s one of the things that he’s (inaudible).

問：—全國的郵件分揀機？那是他（聽不清）的事情之一。

THE PRESIDENT: I don’t know — I don’t know what he’s doing. I can only tell you he’s a very smart man. He’ll be a great Postmaster General. And he needs — obviously, if you’re going to do these millions of ballots out of nowhere, he’s going to obviously need funding. But the Democrats aren’t willing to provide other things and therefore they’re not going to get the funding for that.

總統：我不知道—我不知道他正在做什麼。我只能告訴你他是一個非常聰明的人。他將會是一位出色的郵政局長。而且他需要—很明顯，如果你要統計這些冒出來的數百萬計的（郵遞）投票，顯然他將需要資金。但是民主黨不願意提供其他東西，因此它們不會為此獲得資金。

But you are going to have a catastrophic situation with universal mail-in votes. And, on top of it, the Democrats aren’t willing to give the people the money and the Post Office the money.

但是，通用郵遞投票將會帶來災難性的情況。而且，最重要的是，民主黨不願意給這些人和郵局提供資金。

Q Mr. President, you said a catastrophic situation is going to happen, but what are you doing to ensure that that doesn’t happen, because wouldn’t these problems raise questions about the election results if you win?

問：總統先生，您講一個災難性的情況將會出現，但是您要怎麼做才能確保這種情況不會發生，因為如果您贏了的話，這些問題是否會引起人們對選舉結果的質疑？

THE PRESIDENT: Well, the problem with the mail-in voting, number one, you’re never going to know when the election is over. Okay? I mean, they called the election in New York for Carolyn Maloney. They shouldn’t have done that. I think you should redo that election. And, you know, the opponent is screaming. They can’t believe it. Ballots are lost. Ballots are defrauded. It’s a total mess. And they called it for her. The reason is because I’ve been using it as a case. I’ve been using it as a case.

總統：郵寄投票的問題，第一，你永遠不會知道選舉何時結束。好的？我的意思是，他們在紐約召集對Carolyn Maloney的選舉。他們不應該那樣做。我認為你們應該重新進行這個選舉。而且，你知道，對手在尖叫。他們不敢相信。選票丟失了。選票被騙。一團糟。他們為她叫喊。這就是為什麼我一直在使用它作為一個案例。我一直在用它作為案例。

So, look, we are going to have an election that takes place on a beautiful day, November 3rd. And usually, at the end of the evening, they say, “Donald Trump has won the election.” “Donald Trump is your new President.” Whatever they say.

因此，我們將在11月3日這美好的一天進行一次選舉。通常，在晚上結束的時候，他們說：“唐納德川普贏得了選舉”，“唐納德川普是你們的新總統”。不管他們怎麼說。

You know what? You’re not going to know this — possibly, if you really did it right — for months or for years, because these ballots are all going to be lost. They’re going to be gone. And just take a look at a smaller basis, but it’s great tests. We’re doing tests. I mean, these are — you could call them polls, you could call them tests. Look at what’s happening all over the country, where you have universal mail-in —

你知道嗎？你們可能幾個月或幾年都不會知道這件事（如果你們確實做對了），因為這些選票都將丟失。他們將會消失。並且只看一個較小範圍內的，但這是很好的測試。我們正在測試。我的意思是，這些是—你們可以將其稱為民意測驗，也可以將其稱為測試。看看全國各地這些使用通用郵寄投票的地方發生了什麼—

Q But what are you doing —

問：但是，您在做什麼—

THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. The ballots are lost. There’s fraud. There’s theft. It’s happening all over the place.

總統：等一下。選票丟失，有欺詐行為發生，有盜竊發生，各個地方都在發生。

Now we’re going to do it with this whole, vast, big section of the country. It’s crazy.

現在，我們將在整個國家的整個廣闊的地區中做到這一點。這很瘋狂。

Q Because you have made it so plain that you are opposed and do not trust mail-in voting, is your Postmaster General using the agency of the Postal Service to create delays because —

問：因為您已經說得很明白，您表示反對和不信任郵寄投票，是您的郵政局長正在使用郵政服務機構來造成延誤，原因是：

THE PRESIDENT: No, not at all. He would love to see it happen. I didn’t speak to him about it, but I will tell you this: I would imagine he would say — number one, they didn’t give me the funding for it because it’s sitting in Congress because they — they want a trillion dollars to bail out states, just so you —

總統：不，完全沒有。他很想看到它的發生。我沒有和他談過這個事情，但是我告訴你：我想他會說-第一，他們沒有給我資金來做這個，因為資金還在國會，因為他們（民主黨）想要一萬億美元救濟一些州，就是這樣-

Q But this isn’t what is causing delays, sir.

問：先生，但這不是造成延誤的原因。

THE PRESIDENT: — understand what they want.

總統：—瞭解他們想要什麼。

THE PRESIDENT: They want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run Democrat-run states, okay? That’s what they want. They’re not giving the money to the Post Office. They have to give the money to the Post Office.

總統：他們想獲得一萬億美元的援助以拯救民主黨掌控的非常混亂的州，好嗎？那就是他們想要的。他們沒有把錢給郵局。他們必須把錢交給郵局。

Q But the steps the Postmaster General is taking are creating some delays now.

問：但是，郵政局長正在採取的步驟現在造成了一些延遲。

HE PRESIDENT: No, the steps he’s creating —

總統：不，他正在建立的步驟-

Q Is he trying to —

問：他是否要-

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Yeah.

總統：是的。是的。

Q — discourage mail-in voting? Are you trying to discourage?

問：不鼓勵郵寄投票？您要勸阻嗎？

THE PRESIDENT: No, not at all. The steps that he is taking are trying to stop the tremendous losses that have taken place for many, many years. He’s trying to streamline the Post Office and make it great again. Okay?

總統：不，完全沒有。他正在採取的步驟是試圖阻止很多年來已經發生的巨大損失。他正在努力簡化郵局的工作，使其再創輝煌。好的？

Q ：Eighty days before an election, sir? Is this the right time?

問：先生，在選舉前八十天嗎？這是適當的時候嗎？

THE PRESIDENT: Well, wait a minute. You just threw — look, I just read last night that now New Jersey is going to try the universal mail-in voting. Well, they didn’t know this. So now, all of a sudden, New Jersey is going to be hit with millions of ballots to be sent out. They didn’t know anything about this.

總統：好，等一下。你剛剛提到-我昨晚剛剛讀到，現在新澤西州將嘗試通用郵寄投票。但他們不知道這一點。所以現在，突然之間，新澤西州將有送出的數百萬張選票的工作要做。他們對此一無所知。

So how does a Post Office — how does a Postal Service that doesn’t know about it, now all of a sudden, New Jersey is supposed to take out, and millions of ballots are going to be sent all over New Jersey?

那麼郵局又如何呢？不知此事的郵政服務部門將如何處理，突然之間，新澤西州數百萬張選票將被發送到整個新澤西州？

And if you look at some of the things they say, like in — take the state of Nevada, take that little scam that’s going on over there with the clubhouse politician governor. Take that, where the votes don’t even have to be in until seven — they get counted seven days after November 3rd. That means if — Nevada is a very important state. I think we have a great chance of winning that state. If the votes don’t have to be in for seven and they’re not counting the votes seven days later, that means how are they going to predict a winner on November 3rd?

而且，如果您看看他們所說的話，例如內華達州，與會所政治家州長一起進行的那次騙局。如此一來，甚至不需要投票一直到7天-他們到11月3日之後的7天內才會開始統計票數。那意味著內華達州是否是一個非常重要的州。我認為我們很有可能贏得該州。如果選票不必在7天內進來，並且7天后又不計票，那他們將如何預測11月3日的獲勝者？

Q Mr. President, the inspector general announced that they are —

問：總統先生，監察長宣佈他們是-

Q Mr. President, whether a ballot was automatically sent to somebody or if it was requested —

問：總統先生，是否自動將選票發送給某人，或者是否已將其要求-

THE PRESIDENT: No, absentee is okay.

主席：不，缺席投票是可以的。

Q： Okay, but once a ballot gets into the mail, it doesn’t matter — the workers have to sort it. So the bottom line is, there must be more resources for post offices across the country to deal with —

問：好的，但是一旦選票送出去就沒關係了，工作人員必須對其進行分類。因此，最重要的是，全國各地的郵局必須有更多資源來處理這些選票-

THE PRESIDENT: But the Democrats are not — they are not approving the resources. You’re right, there has to be more resources, I agree, because all of a sudden —

總統：但是民主黨人並沒有批准這些資源。我同意你說的，必須有更多的資源來處理選票，因為突然之間-

Q So are you doing anything to provide that?

問：您正在為此做些什麼來提供這些資源？

THE PRESIDENT: — the Post Office is tripling up instead.

總統：除非郵局變成它的三倍。

The problem is the Democrats are not approving the funds necessary. It’s in there. Now, they have $25 billion. I’ve seen $15 billion. I’ve seen a lot of money. I don’t know how you’re going to spend that much, but that’s what they’re saying. They’re saying.

問題是民主黨沒有批准必要的資金。錢就那裡。共250億美元。我看到過150億美元。我看到很多錢。我不知道您怎麼花那麼多錢，但這就是他們的意思。

So not only do they want a trillion dollars to hand out as welfare to all these states that are run by Democrats doing badly, they want $25 billion for the Post Office. But they’re not approving it.

因此，他們不僅希望將一萬億美元作為福利分發給所有民主黨沒有治裡好的州，而且還希望為郵政局提供250億美元。但是民主黨沒有批准。

Now, what I want is a lot of money — thousands of dollars — to go to people because they need money. They really — despite the good numbers, despite numbers like that, they need money to live. And I want that to happen. The Democrats don’t care about that. They just want to give bailout money to their friends running big states poorly.

現在，我想要的是很多錢（數千美元）去給這些急需錢人們。他們確實-儘管人數眾多，儘管人數如此，但他們需要錢去生存。我希望做到這一點。民主黨人不在乎這些。他們只想將救助資金提供給經營狀況欠佳的大州的朋友們。

Q： A question on vaccines.

問：有關疫苗的問題。

Q Mr. President, should you be looking in the camera, sir, and ensuring the United States, the people of the United States, that mailing —

問：總統先生，請您看著照相機，並確保美國人民，郵寄-

THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.

總統：繼續。

Q Do you want to give Edward Snowden a pardon and bring him back? You once suggested that he was a traitor and should be executed.

問：您想赦免愛德華·斯諾登並將他帶回來嗎？您曾經建議他是叛徒，應將其處決。

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m going to look at it. I mean, I’m not that aware of the Snowden situation, but I’m going to start looking at it. There are many, many people — it seems to be a split decision that many people think that he should be somehow treated differently, and other people think he did very bad things. And I’m going to take a very good look at it. Okay?

總統：好，我要查看一下。我的意思是，我不太瞭解斯諾登的情況，但是我將開始調查一下。很多人對對待他的方式持不同的意見，而其有些人則認為他做得很糟糕。我要好好的研究研究。好嗎？

I mean, I’ve — I’ve seen people that are very conservative and very liberal, and they agree on the same issue; they agree both ways. I’m going to take a look at that very strongly, Edward Snowden.

我是說-我見過非常保守和非常自由的人，而他們在同一問題上達成共識；他們兩種方法都同意。我將仔細點研究一下，愛德華·斯諾登（Edward Snowden）。

Q Do you believe with Dr. Robert Redfield who, earlier this week, said if America doesn’t follow public health guidelines, we could be in store for one of the worst falls we’ve ever faced, from a public health perspective?

問：您是否相信羅伯特·雷德菲爾德（Robert Redfield）博士本周早些時候說的，如果美國不遵循公共衛生準則，那麼從公共衛生的角度來看，我們可能會面臨有史以來最嚴重（流型病）的一個秋天？

THE PRESIDENT: No, I mean, you can’t compare it to 1917. That was incredible. That was — that was the worst ever by far. That was — you look at — they lost possibly 100 million people. No, I don’t agree with that.

總統：不，我的意思是，您無法將其與1917年相提並論。那是–迄今為止最嚴重的一次。您所看到的就是，那時他們可能失去了1億人。不，我不同意他的說法。

But if you look at these numbers, they’re coming down very substantially. And I do believe that Americans — many are wearing masks, which is a good thing. Again, some people thought that you shouldn’t wear a mask. You know, when this whole thing started, Dr. Fauci, who I like and respect, said “don’t wear masks,” okay? And so did Dr. Redfield. And then, all of a sudden, it was like everybody should wear masks. And that’s okay. People can change their mind.

但是，如果您查看這些病例的數字，他們正在大幅下降。我確實相信美國人-許多人戴著口罩，這是一件好事。同樣，有些人認為您不應該戴口罩。您知道，當這一切開始時，我喜歡並尊敬的Fauci博士說：“不用戴口罩”，雷德菲爾德博士也是如此。然後，突然之間，每個人都應該戴著口罩。那好人們可以改變他們的主意。

But wash your hands, good hygiene — all of those things — I think people are really doing it to a level that they’ve never done before.

但是要洗手，保持良好的衛生習慣-所有這些事情-我認為人們的確做到了前所未有的高度。

And when you look — and when you look at — when you look at the numbers, the way the numbers are coming out, I mean, it’s very impressive when you see what’s happening.

當您查看這些數位時，病例的數位所顯示的，我的意思是，當您看到正在發生的事情時，令人印象非常深刻。

By the way, Florida doing well. You see that. And hospitalizations and all — you know, normally you would have had to build more hos- — like we did for the first surge. We’ve done it right. We closed it up. We had the greatest economy in history. We closed it up. We understand the disease now. Nobody knew. Nobody knew what was hitting us, right? Nobody knew that old people would be very, very susceptible, especially if they have heart and diabetes problems and other problems; that old people would be very susceptible and young people would be extremely good with it. If you look at the percentages, there are a tiny percentage that have problems, especially the big problem.

順便說一句，佛羅里達州現在好多了。看到了住院病人和所的有這些-通常都必須建造更多的醫院–就像我們為第一次高峰期所做的那樣。我們做的對。我們關閉了一切。我們有過有史以來最繁榮的經濟。我們關閉了一切。我們現在瞭解這種疾病。剛開始沒有人知道是什麼在攻擊我們，對吧？沒有人知道老年人會非常非常容易受到傷害，特別是如果他們有心臟病，糖尿病和其他疾病。老年人將非常容易受到感染，而年輕人將對此非常有抵抗力。如果您查看百分比，你會看到年輕人有很小的百分比出現問題，更少的年輕人會出現病重。

So, no, I think that we’re doing very well. We’re on our way. And we’re also opening up our economy, and our economy is going to set records. And if stupid people aren’t elected next year, we’re going to have one of the greatest years that we’ve ever had.

所以，不，我認為我們做得很好。我們正在恢復。而且我們也在開放經濟，我們的經濟將創下紀錄。如果明年愚蠢的人不被當選，我們將擁有我們曾經有過的最偉大的一年。

Q Thank you, Mr. President. You’ve already taken action on TikTok and WeChat. Which other Chinese tech companies are you looking at banning from operating in the United States?

**問：謝謝總統先生。您已經對抖音和微信採取了行動。您還想禁止其他哪些中國科技公司在美國運營？**

THE PRESIDENT: Well, the big thing is Huawei, right? Huawei is not here. And Huawei I’m not allowing. And I’ve told European countries and others — Australia has been fantastic, as an example. But Huawei is not coming here.

**總統：最重要的是華為，對嗎？華為不在這裡了。我不允許華為進來。我已經告訴歐洲國家和其他國家-例如，澳大利亞真是做得很好。但是華為允許不會來這裡。**

And we told certain countries that were thinking about Huawei: “That’s okay, you can use them, but we’re not going to be sharing intelligence.” And they’ve all backed away. If you look at the UK, it looked like they were going that way and now they backed out — Scotland Yard.

**我們告訴某些正在考慮華為的國家：“沒關係，您可以使用它們，但我們不會共用情報。”他們都退縮了。如果您看一下英國，看起來好像他們在往那邊走，現在他們從華為退出了-蘇格蘭場。**

Q Are there other particular companies — say, Alibaba?

**問：還有其他特別的公司，例如阿裡巴巴嗎？**

THE PRESIDENT: There are most — well, yeah.

**總統：最多，是的。**

Q ：Baidu.

問：百度。

THE PRESIDENT: We’re looking at other things. Yes, we are. We are.

總統：我們查看其他公司。是的我們是。

Q： Mr. President, you say that you want the mail to be processed as quickly as it can, but why is your Postal Service dismantling these mail-sorting machines across the country at this time?

問：總統先生，您說您希望儘快處理選票郵件，但是為什麼您的郵政局此時要在全國範圍內拆除這些郵件分揀機？

THE PRESIDENT: Well, you’ll have to ask him. I know this: He’s a very efficient operator, a very good operator, but again, he needs money to operate if you’re going to hit him with millions of ballots.

總統：好，你得問他。我知道這一點：他是一個非常高效的操作員，一個非常好的操作員，但同樣，如果您有用幾百萬張選票郵寄進來，他還需要錢來操作。

Q ：Did he brief you on his plans?

問：他有沒有向你介紹他的計畫？

THE PRESIDENT: And if you ask him, he will tell you, and he’ll tell you very nicely: You have the money, it’s sitting there, it’s ready to go. The Democrats don’t want to approve it, but I want money for other things too. I want money to go to people so they can live very nicely, because China caused the problem; they didn’t.

總統：如果你問他，他會告訴你，他會很好地告訴你：你有錢放在那裡，已經準備好了。民主黨人不想批准它，但我也想花錢做其他事情。我要錢給人們，使他們過上很好的生活，因為中國造成的問題。而他們沒有。

Q ：On the campaign: Will you say now that Kamala Harris is eligible to run and be Vice President or President, based on being born in Oakland, California?

問：關於競選活動：您現在是否說卡馬拉·哈裡斯（Kamala Harris）有資格競選並擔任副總統或總統因為她出生於加利福尼亞州奧克蘭市？

THE PRESIDENT: So, I have nothing to do with that. I read something about it. And I will say that he is a brilliant lawyer that — I guess he wrote an article about it. So I know nothing about it, but it’s not something that bothers me.

總統：因此，我與此無關。我讀了一些關於此事的文章。我會說他是一位出色的律師，我猜他寫過一篇有關它的文章。所以我對此一無所知，但這不是困擾我的事情。

Q But, sir, when you do that, it creates doubt.

問：先生，當您這樣做時，會引起懷疑。

THE PRESIDENT: Why do you say that? I just don’t know about it, but it’s not something that we will be pursuing.

總統：你為什麼這麼說？我只是不知道，但這不是我們要追求的。

Q But you do know it, sir. You do —

問，先生，您確實知道。你做 –

THE PRESIDENT: Let me put it differently.

總統：讓我換個說法。

Q Mr. President, you know.

問：總統先生，你知道嗎。

THE PRESIDENT: Let me be —

總統：讓我成為-

Q You can simply clear this up.

問：您可以簡單地將其清除。

THE PRESIDENT: Let me put it differently. Don’t tell me what I know. (Laughter.) Let me put it differently. Let me put it differently: To me, it doesn’t bother me at all. I don’t know about it. I read one quick article. The lawyer happens to be a brilliant lawyer, as you probably know. He wrote an article saying there could be a problem. It’s not something that I’m going to be pursuing.

總統：讓我換個說法。不要告訴我我所知道的。讓我換個說法。讓我換個說法：對我來說，這根本不會打擾我。我不知道這個事。我讀了一篇簡短的文章。您可能知道，這位律師恰好是一位出色的律師。他寫了一篇文章說可能有問題。這不是我要追求的東西。

Q ：Is she eligible, sir?

問：先生，她有資格嗎？

THE PRESIDENT: I just told you, I have not gone into it in great detail. If she’s got a problem, you would have thought that she would —

總統：我只是告訴你，我沒有詳細的介紹內容。如果她有問題，您可能會以為她會-

Q It’s not that hard, sir.

問，先生，沒那麼難。

THE PRESIDENT: — have been vetted.

總統：—經過了審查。

Q It’s not that hard.

問：這並不難。

THE PRESIDENT: You would have thought that she would have been vetted by Sleepy Joe.

總統：您以為她已經通過了困倦的喬的審查。

Q Mr. President, sir, I just want to ask you: After three weeks of absolutely no deal, you have been ragging on Democrats constantly. Why not come to the table, personally, and sit with them? I mean, I know that Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer were in the Oval Office in December 2018. That did not go so well. Everybody in the world saw that. Why not invite them? If they don’t want to come, that’s on them.

問：總統先生，我只想問你：在完全沒有達成協議三周後，你一直在不停地向民主黨施壓。為什麼不親自和他們一起坐下來？我的意思是，我知道議長佩洛西（Pelosi）和少數党領袖舒默（Schumer）於2018年12月在橢圓形辦公室進展的並不順利。世界上每個人都看到了。為什麼不邀請他們？如果他們不想來，那是他們的事。

THE PRESIDENT: So I think we’ve done very well. We’ve had three phases. We’re into phase four. We’ve gotten everything we wanted. And we’ve also gotten a great economy. All you have to do is take a look at these charts. Our economy is doing good. But we want different things than them. I want money for the people; they want money to bail out Democrat governors and Democrat mayors.

總統：所以我認為我們做得很好。我們已經完成三個階段。我們進入第四階段。我們已經獲得了想要的一切。而且我們的經濟也很棒。您要做的就是看看這些圖表。我們的經濟狀況良好。但是我們想要與他們不同的東西。我為人民要錢；他們想要錢來救助民主黨州長和民主黨市長。

Q But shouldn’t you, as the President, meet with them in person?

問：但是，作為總統，您不應該親自與他們會面嗎？

THE PRESIDENT: Listen to me. Listen to me. My people are doing very good. And my people call me. They’re in the office; they call me. They call me. When it’s right — nobody knows the deal better than I do. When it’s right, I’ll meet. But right now it’s not right. They want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run states. States — they’re Democrat. They’re all — I mean, they’re Democrat states.

總統：聽我說。聽我說。我的人做得很好。我的人給我打電話。他們在辦公室；他們告訴我。沒人比我更瞭解這筆交易。當適當的時間，我會見他們。但是現在不是時候。他們希望獲得一萬億美元的援助，以拯救民主黨人統治的州。我的意思是，它們是民主黨的州。

Will something happen? Possibly. But I want to tell you, the country is doing very well right now. We can live very happily with it, without it. But I’d like to do it because I want to give money to the people. I want to put money into the people’s hands. They want to put money into politicians’ hands so that the politicians don’t look stupid.

會發生什麼事嗎？可能吧。但是我想告訴你，這個國家現在做得很好。有它或沒它，我們都可以過得很幸福。但我想這樣做，是因為我想給人民錢。我想把錢交到人民手中。他們想將錢投入政客的手中，以使政客們看起來不會傻。

Q You’ve had some differences with your Defense Secretary, Mark Esper. Do you have confidence in his leadership there?

問：您與國防部長馬克·埃斯珀（Mark Esper）有一些分歧。您對他在那裡的領導有信心嗎？

THE PRESIDENT: Oh, okay. Some people call him “Yesper.” No, I get along with him. I get along with him fine. He’s fine.

總統：不，我和他相處很好。我和他相處得很好。他很好。

Q Are you considering firing him, Mr. President?

問：總統先生，您是否正在考慮解雇他？

THE PRESIDENT: I consider firing everybody. (Laughter.) At some point — at some point, that’s what happens.

總統：我考慮解雇所有人。 在某個時刻–就是在某個時刻發生了一些事情的時候。

Q Do you think that there’ll be anyone else who leaves your Cabinet after the election, sir?

問：先生，您是否認為大選以後會有其他人離開內閣？

THE PRESIDENT: So, if we have the success — I think we have a silent majority, the likes of which has never been seen before — I think you read about it — where 62 percent of the people say they’re not even telling the truth on polling and where the polling is fake; you know, where they do registered voters and where they do many more Democrats than they do Republicans. Same as happened last time.

總統：如果我們取得成功，我認為我們擁有沉默的多數，以前從未見過這樣的喜歡，我想您已經讀過，其中62％的人說他們甚至沒有告訴投票的真實性所以投票是假的；你知道，他們在哪裡登記選民，在哪裡民主黨比共和黨人多。與上次相同。

But this year, I think we have much more enthusiasm. Maybe those people back there would understand it better than anybody. But I think there’s more enthusiasm for 2020 than there was even for 2016. And 2016 was a record. You found that out. And I believe there’s much more enthusiasm now than there was even in 2016.

但是今年，我認為我們有更大的熱情。也許那些回到那裡的人會比任何人都瞭解它。但我認為2020年的熱情比2016年還要高。2016年是創紀錄的。您發現了。而且我相信現在的熱情比2016年還要高。

We have a silent majority, the likes of which nobody has seen. I just looked — there are thousands of boats in lakes, rivers, and oceans. Thousands and thousands of boats. It’s called “Boaters for Trump,” “Boaters for Trump-Pence.” There’s signs all over. Some of the boats have 10 flags on them. They’re incredible. There are thousands. We did nothing to do this. This is just generic. It just happened.

我們有沉默的多數，沒有人見過這樣的。我只是看到成千上萬的船在湖裡，河流中和海洋中。它被稱為“川普的船夫們”，“川普-彭司的船夫”。川普的旗子到處都是。有些船上有10面旗幟。他們太不可思議了。有成千上萬。我們沒有為此做任何事情。這只是一般的。就這樣發生了。

Let me just tell you, I think the level of enthusiasm for what we’re doing — we want law and order. We want low taxes. They want to raise your taxes. They want to get rid of — they want to have open borders. And they want to defund the police. How do you win on that? They want to go to Texas and they want to go to Pennsylvania, and they want to stop fracking. And Ohio, they want to stop fracking. They’re against steel, they’re against anything with petroleum, the word “petroleum” in it. You won’t have a country. These people are crazy.

我想告訴您，我認為我們正在做的事情充滿熱情-我們要法律和秩序。我們要降低收入稅。他們想提高您的稅收。他們想擺脫—他們想擁有開放的邊界。他們想減少員警開支。您如何贏得勝利？他們想去德克薩斯州，想去賓夕法尼亞州，也想停止水力壓裂。而俄亥俄州，他們想停止水力壓裂。他們反對鋼鐵，反對任何與石油有關的事物，其中包括“石油”一詞。你不會有一個國家。這些人瘋了。

Q But as far as your Cabinet?

問：但就您的內閣而言？

Q As far as your Cabinet goes, do you think you’ll see more turnover in your Cabinet?

問：就您的內閣而言，您認為內閣的會有更多的人離去嗎？

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don’t know. I think for next year — I mean, generally speaking, a lot of times I understand when, if we win, a President will ask for the resignation of everybody and then bring back the people he wants. That’s happened before, Steve. And I could see something like that happening. I think that makes sense.

總統：嗯，我不知道。我認為明年-一般而言，我的意思是說，很多時候我瞭解，如果我們獲勝，總統會要求每個人辭職，然後讓他想要的人回來。那是以前發生的事，史蒂夫。我可以看到類似的情況。我認為這是有道理的。

No, I have a very good Cabinet — I mean, with few exception. I wouldn’t say I’m thrilled with everybody, frankly. But I have — overall, I think we have a very good Cabinet.

不，我的內閣成員非常好-我的意思是，僅有個別例外。坦白地說，我不會對所有人感到高興。但是我有-總的來說，我認為我們有一個非常好的內閣。

I think this — I will say this: No administration — none — no administration, first three and a half years, has done anywhere near what we’ve done. Three hundred — we will have, at the end of the first term, 300, maybe more, federal judges including Court of Appeals, two Supreme Court justices. Nobody has done this.

我想這-我要說的是：沒任何政府頭三年半和我們所做的事情接近。第一屆任期結束時，將有300名聯邦法官，包括上訴法院，兩名最高法院法官，將有300名，也許還會更多。沒有人這樣做。

Take a look at — take a look at what we’ve done: the biggest tax cuts in history; the biggest regulation cuts in history; rebuilt our military; took care of our vets. We have a 91 percent approval rating from the vets. Nobody has ever had a 91 percent approval rating before. We — I guarded the Second Amendment. They want to destroy the Second Amendment. Take a look at Kamala. They want to destroy the Second Amendment.

看看-看我們做了什麼：歷史上最大的減稅措施；歷史上最大的管理削減；重建了我們的軍隊；照顧好我們的老兵。退伍軍人對我們的認可度為91％。以前沒有人有91％的支持率。我們—我捍衛了第二修正案。他們想破壞第二修正案。看看卡瑪拉。他們想破壞第二修正案。

And, as you know, Joe is — has no control over anybody. He has no control over himself.

而且，正如您所知，喬是–無法控制任何人。他無法控制自己。

Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. (Applause.)

好的，非常感謝大家。謝謝。
