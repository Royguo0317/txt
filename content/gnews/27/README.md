Jun Wei Yeo, also known as Dickson Yeo, was sentenced today in federal court to 14 months in prison.  Yeo pled guilty on July 24, 2020 to acting within the United States as an illegal agent of a foreign power without first notifying the Attorney General, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 951.  The announcement was made by John G. Demers, Assistant Attorney General; Michael R. Sherwin, Acting United States Attorney for the District of Columbia; James A. Dawson, Acting Assistant Director in Charge of FBI Washington Field Office; Alan E. Kohler, Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division; and Deputy Assistant Secretary Ricardo Colón, Domestic OperationsDeputy Assistant Secretary Ricardo Colón, Domestic Operations.

楊俊偉（Jun Wei Yeo，又名Dickson Yeo）今天在聯邦法院被判處14個月監禁。 楊俊偉於2020年7月24日認罪，他在美國境內作為外國勢力的非法代理人行事，而沒有事先通知司法部長，這違反了《美國法典》第18編第951條。 宣佈這一消息的是助理總檢察長John G. Demers、哥倫比亞特區代理美國檢察官Michael R. Sherwin、聯邦調查局華盛頓分局辦事處的代理助理主任James A. Dawson、聯邦調查局反間諜司助理主任Alan E. Kohler和國內行動部副助理部長Ricardo Colón。

Yeo was sentenced by The Honorable Tanya S. Chutkan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

楊俊偉由美國哥倫比亞地區法院的Tanya S. Chutkan 閣下判刑。

“At the direction of the Government of the People’s Republic of China, Yeo recruited Americans to provide information that he would pass back to his PRC handlers,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.   “Yeo concealed his PRC affiliation from his recruits and, contrary to law, from the United States Government.  This criminal conduct is part of the PRC’s efforts to exploit the openness of American society by using agents who may appear innocuous, but who act upon taskings from a foreign government to obtain access and information.”

“在中華人民共和國政府的指示下，楊俊偉招募美國人為其提供資訊，並將資訊傳回給他的中(共)國幕僚，”國家安全助理總檢察長John C. Demers說：  “楊俊偉向他的招募者隱瞞了他的中(共)國背景，並違反法律，向美國政府隱瞞了他的身份。 這種犯罪行為是中(共)國利用美國社會的開放性的一部分，他們利用看似無害的代理人，但他們根據外國政府的任務而採取行動，以獲得訪問權和資訊。”

“This case serves as a reminder that China is using professional networking social media sites to target U.S. citizens with government security clearances, and to try to gain non-public and classified information.  The threat is real, and we will prosecute foreign agents who exploit those platforms,” said Michael R. Sherwin, Acting United States Attorney for the District of Columbia.

“此案提醒我們，中(共)國正在利用職業網路社交媒體網站來鎖定通過政府安全審查的美國公民，並試圖獲取非公開和機密資訊。 這種威脅是真實存在的，我們將起訴利用這些平臺的外國代理人”，哥倫比亞特區代理美國檢察官Michael R. Sherwin。

“Today we are reminded yet again of the Chinese government’s aggressive attempts to gain knowledge and information about U.S. policy and government,” said James A. Dawson, Acting Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Washington Field Office. “The FBI’s warning is not new, but the message warrants repeating: the Chinese communist government is working to gain information and access by all means, including recruiting US-based individuals to provide classified and/or sensitive information. There is no doubt that if you are a former clearance holder, you are an ideal and vulnerable target because of your knowledge and access.  If you believe you have been the target of a recruitment scheme, the FBI is here to help. We remain committed to rebuffing the Chinese government’s attempts, and to protecting the American people, our ideas, and our national and economic security interests.”

“今天，這再次提醒我們，中(共)國政府正用頗具侵略的意圖來獲取有關美國政策和美國政府的知識及資訊”，聯邦調查局華盛頓外地辦事處代理助理主任James A. Dawson說，”這並不是FBI的首次警告，但這一資訊值得重複：中(共)國政府正致力於通過各種手段獲取資訊和資料，包括招募美國境內的個人提供機密和/或敏感資訊。毫無疑問，如果你是一個前通過政府安全審查的人，你就是一個理想且易受攻擊的目標，因為你的知識和訪問權。 如果你認為你已經成為招募計畫的目標，聯邦調查局可以幫到你。我們仍然致力於回擊中(共)國政府的企圖，並保護美國人民、我們的思想以及我們的國家和經濟安全利益。”

“Jun Wei Yeo admittedly acted as an illegal agent of a foreign power by using various social media sites, such as a professional networking website and other social networking applications, to recruit Americans with access to sensitive government information. He identified their vulnerabilities, like dissatisfaction with work or financial difficulties, and offered money in exchange for information and written reports,” said Alan E. Kohler Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division.  “This is a sobering reminder that the U.S. needs to be clear-eyed about the scope of the Chinese government’s ambition to manipulate Americans for their own nation’s advancement; and, confronting this threat remains the FBI’s top counterintelligence priority.”

“楊俊偉承認，他作為外國勢力的非法代理人，利用各種社交媒體網站，如一個專業網路網站和其他社交網路應用，招募能夠獲取政府敏感資訊的美國人。他找出他們的弱點，如對工作不滿或經濟困難，並以金錢換取資訊和書面報告”。聯邦調查局反間諜部門助理主任Alan E. Kohler Jr.說， “這是一個發人深省的警示，美國需要清醒地認識到中(共)國政府操縱美國人為自身國家發展的野心大小；而且，對抗這一威脅仍然是FBI反間諜工作的首要任務。”

“The close working relationship between the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office resulted in today’s sentencing of Mr.Yeo before he could potentially harm the security of our country,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary Ricardo Colón, Domestic Operations, U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service. “This was a great success by all of the agencies involved.”

“美國國務院外交安全局、聯邦調查局和美國檢察官辦公室之間的密切合作，促成今天對楊先生的判決，在他有可能損害我們國家的安全之前，”美國國務院外交安全局國內行動部副助理部長Ricardo Colón說，”這是所有參與機構的巨大成功。”

As outlined in the Statement of Offense, Yeo began working with Chinese intelligence officers as early as 2015, initially targeting other Asian countries, but then focusing on the United States.  In response to taskings from his Chinese intelligence contacts, Yeo worked to spot and assess Americans with access to valuable non-public information, including U.S. military and government employees with high-level security clearances.  After Yeo identified American targets, he solicited them for non-public information and paid them to write reports.  Yeo told these American targets that the reports were for clients in Asia, without revealing that they were in fact destined for the Chinese government.

正如犯罪陳述書中所概述的那樣，楊俊偉早在2015年就開始與中(共)國情報人員合作，最初的目標是其他亞洲國家，但後來集中在美國。 依照他中(共)國情報聯絡人員下達的任務，楊俊偉努力發現和評估能夠接觸到有價值的非公開信息的美國人，包括擁有高級安全審查的美國軍方和政府雇員。 在楊俊偉確定了美國目標人後，他向他們索要非公開信息，並付錢讓他們寫報告。 楊俊偉告訴這些美國目標人，這些報告是給亞洲客戶的，而沒有透露這些報告實際上是給中(共)國政府的。

Yeo made use of various social media sites to carry out the taskings given to him by Chinese intelligence operatives.  In 2018, Yeo created a fake consulting company that used the same name as a prominent U.S. consulting firm that conducts public and government relations, and Yeo posted job advertisements under that company name.  Ninety percent of the resumes Yeo received in response were from U.S. military and government personnel with security clearances, and he passed resumes of interest to one of the Chinese intelligence operatives.

楊俊偉利用各種社交媒體網站，來執行中(共)國情報人員交給他的任務。 2018年，楊俊偉創建了一家假的諮詢公司，該公司與美國一家從事公共和政府關係的著名諮詢公司使用相同的名稱，楊俊偉以該公司的名義發佈招聘廣告。 在楊俊偉收到的簡歷中，90%的簡歷來自通過安全審查的美國軍方和政府人員，同時他將感興趣的簡歷交給了給其中一名中(共)國情報人員。

Yeo also used a professional networking website that is focused on career and employment information to carry out the taskings he received from Chinese intelligence officials.  Yeo used the professional networking website to find individuals with resumes and job descriptions suggesting that they would have access to valuable information.  After he identified individuals worth targeting, Yeo followed guidance he received from Chinese intelligence operatives regarding how to recruit potential targets, including identifying their vulnerabilities, such as dissatisfaction with work or financial difficulties.

楊俊偉還利用一個專注於職業和就業資訊的專業社交網站，來執行中(共)國情報官員交給他的任務。 楊俊偉利用這個專業社交網站，通過簡歷和工作描述表明其可能獲得有價值之資訊來物色人。 在他確定了值得鎖定的個人之後，楊俊偉按照中(共)國情報人員提供 關於如何招募潛在目標的指導包括確定他們的弱點，比如對工作不滿或經濟困難。

The investigation into this matter was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Washington Field Office and the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas N. Saunders and Erik M. Kenerson of the National Security Section of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, along with David Aaron of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of the National Security Division of the Department of Justice. If you suspect you have been the target of a recruitment scheme, contact your local FBI Field Office.

對此事的調查是由聯邦調查局華盛頓分局辦事處和美國國務院外交安全局執行的。美國哥倫比亞特區檢察官辦公室國家安全科的助理檢察官Thomas N. Saunders和Erik M. Kenerson，以及司法部國家安全司反間諜和出口管制科的David Aaron正對此案進行起訴。如果您懷疑自己是招募計畫的目標，請與您當地聯邦調查局分局辦事處聯繫。
