## 做空港币不是穷人的游戏
` Himalaya Rose Garden Team` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/955260/)

新闻简述：在2021年3月5日的盖特视频中，郭先生焦急地告诉众多给他发信息询问做空港币的人。他说：“永远记住：穷人别想着挣邪钱，那不是咱穷人的事；再一个，没有大钱的人就别想挣大钱，不可能。别挣那危险的钱，挣那钱，钱来多快，走的多块，甚至一定走得比来得快。”

**做空港币不是穷人的游戏**

**Shorting Hong Kong Dollars Is Not the Game for the Poor**

尊敬的战友们好，我这是刚刚直播完，我是刚刚运动，我在运动中间给战友们回信息，你看这后面啊，后面是这样的，G-Fashion T恤，这里是毛的，特别的暖乎，超级棒。

Hello, my honorable fellow fighters. I just finished the live broadcast and finished workout. I replied our fellow fighters’ messages while working out. Look at my back. This is how it looks, G-Fashion’s T-shirt. It is made of cashmere, very warm, super nice.

我给大家回复，很多人给我发信息，俄罗斯的战友，日本的战友，德国的战友，七哥，我们现在要可以做空港币，买空港币，呼啦啦的没完没了的，我也不能一个一个回了。我简单在这说一下，除非你是疯了，兄弟姐妹们，你去买空港币，人家贪婪的时候，你也跟着贪婪，那你不是找死了嘛，关键你有本事跟人家贪婪吗？人家是几百万、几千万、几亿、几十亿、几百亿、几千亿进去，你以为你跟着人都呼啦一下就能赚到钱吗？

I was replying messages to people. Many fellow fighters from Japan and Germany sent me messages, saying “Brother Seven, we are going to short Hong Kong dollars, short selling Hong Kong dollars”. Endless messages like this, so I cannot respond to each of them. Let me say it here briefly. Unless you are insane, brothers and sisters, [don’t do it]. If you short Hong Kong dollars and follow those greedy people, you will be dead. The problem is that do you have the ability to be greedy like them? They put millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, tens of billions, or hundreds of billions in it. Do you think you can make money just by following them?

这个中间会有多个起起伏伏，共产党沼泽地的较量，你只能玩一次，人家下，你赚了，人家一上你没了，人再一下，你又没了，你再上…你跟不下去呀，就像真的是说七哥郭三秒一样，你就三下，一、二、三，没了，你再看…只能啥瞪眼，人家再高潮跟你啥关系啊？这不是作死吗？

There will be many ups and downs in the process and battles between the CCP and the swamp. You can only afford to play once, that is, when it goes down, you win, and when it goes up, you lose, and when it’s down again, you lose again, and when it’s up again, you will have nothing to follow. It’s just like what they called me, “three seconds of sex of Guo”, for you can only hold for three times. One, two, three, and then it’s over. After that, you can only watch them playing. It will have nothing to do with you anymore, no matter how high they get. Isn’t this the fastest way to ruin yourself?

有人会挣嘛？你能撑过六秒，能撑过30秒，你还能高兴两下。别糊涂了，兄弟姐妹们。赚大钱永远不是说在投机中得到的，赚大钱是有大钱的人做到的，冒大风险人做到的。凡是有这种心理人脑子都是有问题嘛，你看看这G-Fashion，求求了兄弟姐妹们，七哥没法一一而回，我咋一一而回啊？

Will anyone make a fortune from it? If you can hold for longer than six seconds, thirty seconds, you may feel happy for a little while. Don’t be silly, brothers and sisters. Big fortune is never meant to be obtained from taking chances. Big money can only be made by people who possess big money and are willing to take big risks. Anyone with this kind of mentality is crazy. (Look at our G-Fashion.) So, I beg you, brothers and sisters. I cannot respond every message. How can I reply every single one of them?

疯了？还想赚这钱？你那个三万、五万，三五十万，你那百八十万在那里面算毛钱啊？你去看那港币倒塌前和制裁前，那得有几个起伏呐。最后钱落谁家？就那几家，怎么可能啊？它得有个大池子才行，多少人现在倒霉啊？头一段押港币的，现在倾家荡产，他也回不来了，连卡尔巴斯那个基金都快完蛋了，知道了吧？你寻思啥呢？你想去玩？永远记住：穷人别想着挣邪钱，那不是咱穷人的事；再一个，没有大钱的人就别想挣大钱，不可能。别挣那危险的钱，挣那钱，钱来多快，走的多块，甚至一定走得比来得快。

Are you crazy? Hoping to earn this type of money? Your tens of thousands dollars or hundreds of thousands dollars are nothing in there. Let’s wait and see how many ups and downs there will be prior to the collapse of Hong Kong dollars and the sanctions. Who will be the ultimate winner? Only a few families! How can you possibly win? It needs a big pool to win. How many people are doomed right now? Those who jumped in previously are bankrupt now and have no chance to come back. Even Kyle Bass’s fund is almost bankrupt. Do you know how serious it is now? What are you thinking? You want to play? Please remember, don’t think about making risky money if you are not rich. Also, please don’t dream of making big money if you don’t have big money. It is impossible. Don’t make risky money. Those kind of money come in fast and go away fast, and it could go away even faster than you get them.

这是定律，拜托了兄弟姐妹们，我不能一一而回，我就说到这吧，我得开会去了。

This is the law. Please, brothers and sisters. I cannot respond every and single one of your messages. That’s all I want to say for now. I need to go to the meeting now.
