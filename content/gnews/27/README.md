英文標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep227: The Mongolian gathered in front of the Tokyo Embassy to protest against CCP’s cultural extermination

內容簡介

1. 在歐洲訪問的中國外長王毅威脅訪問台灣的捷克參議長踩到紅線了，將會為此付出沈重的代價；德國外長發言力挺捷克，警告王毅不准威脅歐洲；布拉格市某區長嗆王毅是“魯莽的小丑”，要求王毅24小時內道歉。
2. 蒙人東京大使館前集會抗議中共文化滅絕。中共實施對蒙古語教育滅絕性的政策，引起了全世界華人的關注。在日蒙古人自發組織活動，抗議中共。
3. 中共終於意識到美國與中共脫鉤的局面已經無法避免，開始給牆內老百姓洗腦，說中美脫鉤對中國有利。中國將與美國脫鉤。
4. 昨天香港人的大遊行遭到警方殘酷鎮壓，至少有289民香港市民被抓捕；路邊一名被警察嚇到的12歲小女生，看到警察後，因為害怕慌張的跑開了，卻被5名警察抓住壓在其身上，小女孩在地上不斷地掙扎。
5. （郭文貴在戰鬥室，9/7）美國和西方世界沒有選擇。這不是你們想不想脫鉤的問題，你們沒有能力選擇不脫鉤，中共在這方面有準備。另一條路，脫鉤。你們只有一條路（讓中共）餓死，用脫鉤來完全餓死中共。讓美國恢復安全和宗教自由。


1. The CCP Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who is visiting Europe, threatened that the Czech Senate President visiting Taiwan stepped on the red line, and he would pay a heavy price for it; the German Foreign Minister backed the Czech Republic and warned Wang Yi not to threaten Europe; Prague district mayor Řeporyje called Wang Yi “a reckless clown” and demanded an apology within 24 hours.
2. The Mongolian gathered in front of the Tokyo Embassy to protest against CCP’s cultural extermination. The CCP’s policy of abolishing Mongolian language education has aroused the attention of Chinese people all over the world. In Japan, Mongolians organized activities spontaneously to protest against the CCP.
3. The CCP finally has realized that it was inevitable to decouple from the U.S. and began to brainwash the people inside the firewall, saying that the decoupling between China and the U.S. is good to China, thus China will actively decouple itself from the U.S.
4. At least 289 Hong Kong citizens were arrested yesterday when their peaceful march was brutally suppressed by the police yesterday. A 12-year-old girl who was frightened by the police on the side of the road ran away in a panic at the sight of the police, only to be grabbed by five CCP police officers and crushed on top of her as she struggled on the ground.
5. (Miles Guo With War Room, 9/7) America and the western world have no choice. Decoupling is not about you want or not. You have no capability to choose not to decouple. The CCP has prepared this… Another side, decouple! You know, you have only one way to go. It is to starve the CCP, to decouple with the CCP in order to completely starve it. Only by doing that you could make America safe, secure, and have the freedom of religion again.
