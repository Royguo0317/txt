新聞簡述：2020年10月5日，在川普總統出院當日，Walter Reed 醫院醫療團隊，包括 Conley 醫生，最後舉行了一次新聞發佈會，介紹川普總統出院和返回白宮的具體情況，並詳細回答了記者提出的各種問題。



**中英文對照翻譯**

Dr. Sean Conley: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for being here.

Sean Conley醫生：大家下午好。謝謝你們來到這裡。

Over the past 24 hours, the president has continued to improve. He’s met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria. He’ll receive another dose of remdesivir here today, and then we plan to get him home. It’s been more than 72 hours since his last fever, oxygen levels, including ambulatory saturations and his work of breathing are all normal. Though he may not entirely be out of the woods yet, the team and I agree that all our evaluations, and most importantly his clinical status, support the president’s safe return home, where he’ll be surrounded by world-class medical care 24/7.

在過去的24小時里，總統的病情持續好轉。他達到或超過了所有標準的出院准則。他今天將在這裡接受另一劑瑞德西韋， 然後我們計劃讓他回家。距離他上次發燒已經超過72小時了，氧氣水平，包括動態飽和度和他的呼吸都很正常。儘管他可能還未完全脫離困境，但團隊和我一致認為，我們所有的評估，最重要的是他的臨床狀態，都支持總統安全回家，在那裡，他將得到全天候世界級的醫療護理。

I’d like to bring Dr. Dooley up to review some more specifics.

請Dooley醫生前來解述一些更具體的東西。

Dr. Sean Dooley: Good afternoon, just a brief update this morning. As Dr. Conley mentioned, the president continues to do very well. His vital signs this morning were notable for a temperature of 98.1, his blood pressure was 134 over 78, and a respiratory rate of 17 respirations per minute, and his heart rate was 68 beats per minute. His last oxyhemoglobin saturation was 97% on room air. He currently does not endorse any respiratory complaints, and aside from our evaluation with the multi-disciplinary team this morning, has maintained a full schedule, ambulating and working on the White House medical unit.

Sean Dooley醫生：下午好，今天早上只是一個簡單更新。正如Conley醫生提到的，總統的情況持續向好。今早他的生命體徵明顯，體溫98. 1，血壓134/78，呼吸頻率為每分鐘17次，心率為每分鐘68次。他的最新氧合血紅蛋白飽和度在室內空氣下為97%。他目前沒有任何呼吸道的不適，除了今天上午我們與多學科團隊的評估之外，他一直保持著全負荷日程，在白宮醫療單元內活動和工作。

I’ll now turn it over to Dr. Garibaldi to again discuss therapeutics. Thanks.

我現在把它交給Garibaldi醫生，再次討論療法。謝謝。

Dr. Brian Garibaldi: Hi, good afternoon. Again, I just wanted to echo the sentiment of what an honor it is to be part of this wonderful team here at Walter Reed. Yesterday evening the president received his third dose of remdesivir and he tolerated that infusion without difficulty and his kidney and liver function continued to be normal. Our plan is to give the fourth dose of remdesivir this evening before he goes back to the White House. We’ve made arrangements to deliver the fifth and final dose of his treatment course at the White House tomorrow evening. He continues on dexamethasone and, again, the plan for today is to continue to be up and out of bed, eat and drink, and work as he is able.

Brian Garibaldi醫生：大家下午好。我想再次同樣表達，在沃爾特-里德這裡能成為這個優秀團隊的一員是多麼的榮幸。昨天晚上，總統接受了他的第三劑瑞德西韋，他順利地接受了輸液，他的腎臟和肝臟功能持續正常。我們的計劃是在他回白宮之前，今晚再給他注射第四劑瑞德西韋。我們已經安排好了明天晚上在白宮給他注射第五次，也是治療過程中最後一次劑量。他繼續服用地塞米松，同樣，今天的計劃是繼續離床，進食，飲水和工作，盡其所能。

Dr. Brian Garibaldi: I’d like to turn it over to Dr. Jason Blaylock, who’s an infectious disease specialist and the chief of medicine here at Walter Reed to give some updates on infection control. Thank you.

Brian Garibaldi醫生：我想請Jason Blaylock醫生，他是傳染病專家，也是沃爾特-里德的醫學主管，給大家介紹一下感染控制的最新情況。謝謝。

Dr. Jason Blaylock: Good afternoon, everyone. First of all, I just want to say what an honor it’s been to be part of this medical team behind me and to care for the president.

Jason Blaylock醫生：大家下午好。 首先，我只想說，能成為我身後這個醫療團隊的一員，並照顧總統，是多麼的榮幸。

Since the president’s arrival at Walter Reed, he’s received medical management that remains in line with national, clinical, societal guidelines for treatment of COVID-19 infection. In addition, both myself and Dr. Wes Campbell have worked very closely with various laboratories in the area, state-of-the-art facilities, to include USAMRAA and [RAR 00:03:10] on obtaining advanced diagnostic testing to really inform the White House medical team of both the status of the president, as well as his ability to transmit virus to others. Also, we have worked very closely with the Walter Reed team to ensure that we are looking very closely at infection control prevention strategies and the right posture so that the president can safely return to his residence.

自從總統來到沃爾特里德，他接受的醫療管理符合COVID-19感染治療的國家，臨床，社會准則。此外，我和Wes Campbell醫生與該地區的各種實驗室密切合作，利用最先進的設施，包括USAMRAA以獲得先進的診斷測試，來真實通告白宮醫療團隊關於總統的狀態，以及他傳播病毒給其他人的能力。此外，我們還與沃爾特-里德團隊密切合作，以確保我們非常密切地關注預防感染的策略和得當的措施，以便總統能夠安全地返回住所。

With that, I’m going to turn it over to Dr. Conley, who will answer any final questions?

說到這兒，我將把它交給Conley醫生，他將回答最後的問題。

Dr. Sean Conley: Thanks, Jason.

Sean Conley醫生：謝謝你，Jason。

I mentioned it Saturday, but I’d like to reiterate myself just how grateful the president and I are to the men and women of Walter Reed, our colleagues at Johns Hopkins, as well as the many federal, private institutions that we’ve received support from. So long as everything continues on the track that we’re experiencing right now, at this time, as the president already tweeted out, is to get him home later today. With that, I’ll take a couple questions.

我在週六提到過，但我想重申一下，總統和我是多麼感謝沃爾特-里德的男女同事，我們在約翰-霍普金斯大學的同事，以及給於我們支持的許多聯邦、私人機構，如果一切都在我們現在所經歷的軌道上繼續進行，此時，正如總統在推特上所說，就是讓他今天晚些時候回家。說到這裡，我將回答幾個問題。

【答記者問環節】

Speaker 5:  Dr. Conley, how can the president be discharged back to the White House when he was given steroids. You’ve said that he’s still on those steroids. Those are medicines, as you know, that are usually given to COVID patients who are on ventilators or with low oxygen, so did you over-treat him? If he’s still on that medication, how is it safe for him to return to the White House?

記者：Conley醫生，總統被注射了類固醇，怎麼能回白宮呢？你說過他還在服用這些類固醇。你知道，那些藥通常是給使用呼吸機或缺氧的COVID患者服用的，所以你是否對他進行了過度治療？如果他還在服用那些藥物，他回到白宮怎麼會安全？

Dr. Sean Conley: We send patients home with medications all the time. In fact, yesterday afternoon, he probably met most of his discharge requirements safely from the hospital. He’s returning to a facility, the White House medical unit, that’s staffed 24/7, top-notch physicians, nurses, PAs, logisticians. The unit here, the team here behind me, is going to continue to support us in that nature.

Sean Conley醫生：我們經常讓病人帶藥回家。事實上，昨天下午，他可能已滿足了大部分的安全出院要求。他將回到一個設施，即白宮醫療單元，那裡有全天候的工作人員，一流的醫生、護士、助理醫師、後勤人員。這裡的單元，我身後的團隊，會繼續以這種方式支持我們。

Yes?

請。

Speaker 6: Dr. Conley. Dr. Conley, what are infection control measures are you taking and how was it safe for him to drive around in a cloth mask yesterday? How is it safe for him now to return to the White House where there’ve been so many cases? How’s any of this safe?

記者：Conley醫生， Conley醫生，你採取的感染控制措施是什麼？ 昨天他戴著布面罩坐車兜風，怎麼會安全？他現在回到有那麼多感染病例的白宮又如何能安全？這些怎麼能安全？

Dr. Sean Conley: The president has been surrounded by medical and security staff for days wearing full PPE. Yesterday, the US Secret Service agents were in that same level of PPE for a very short period of time. We’ve worked with our infectious disease experts to make some recommendations for how to keep everything safe down at the White House for the president and those around him. We’re looking at where he’s going to be able to carry out his duties, office space. I’ll just say that it’s in line with everything we’ve been doing upstairs for the last several days.

Sean Conley醫生：總統身邊的醫護人員和安保人員連日來都穿著全套個人防護裝備。昨天，美國特勤局特工也在短時間內穿著同樣級別的個人防護裝備。我們和我們的傳染病專家合作，提出了一些建議，如何保證總統和他身邊的人在白宮的一切安全。我們正在研究他在哪裡能夠履行職責，辦公空間。我只想說，這與我們過去幾天在這樓上所做的一切是一致的。

Speaker 7: Can you tell us please, on testing, can you tell us when he had his last negative test? Was it Thursday? Was it Wednesday? Do you remember when he had his last negative test?

記者：你能否告訴我們，在檢測方面，你能否告訴我們，他最後一次檢測呈陰性是什麼時候？是週四嗎？是週三嗎？你還記得他最後一次檢測呈陰性是什麼時候嗎？

Dr. Sean Conley: I don’t want to go backwards.

Sean Conley醫生：我不想回溯。

Speaker 7: It helps for contact tracing for people who were around him to know when he was positive.

記者：這有助於接觸追蹤他身邊的人，知道他什麼時候是陽性。

Dr. Sean Conley: I understand. The contact tracing, as I understand it, is being done. I’m not involved in that.

Sean Conley醫生：我理解。據我所知，接觸人的追蹤正在進行中。我沒有參與其中。

Speaker 8: [crosstalk] that he leave or was this something he pushed for?

記者：[交叉發言，無法聽清] 他出院是他強迫的嗎？

Dr. Sean Conley: No. We try to get patients home and out of the hospital as quickly as is safe and reasonable. Every day a patient stays in the hospital unnecessarily is a risk to themselves. Right now there’s nothing that’s being done upstairs here that we can’t safely conduct down home.

Sean Conley醫生：不是。我們盡量讓病人在安全合理的情況下盡快出院回家。病人在醫院裡不必要地多呆一天，對他們自己來說都是一種危險。現在，沒有什麼是在這樓上能做到， 我們不能安全地在家裡操作的。

Speaker 9: You had said that seven to ten days was a window that you’d be concerned about. I don’t think we’re there yet. Do you have concerns about potential worsening or reversal? What are your plans for addressing that if it were to happen?

記者：你說過七到十天是你擔心的時間窗口。 我認為還沒到那個時候。你是否擔心潛在的惡化或逆轉？如果發生這種情況，你有什麼計劃來解決？

Dr. Sean Conley: You’re absolutely right. That’s why we all remain cautiously optimistic and on guard because we’re in a bit of unchartered territory when it comes to a patient that received the therapies he has so early in the course. We’re looking to this weekend. If we can get through to Monday with him remaining the same or improving, better yet, then we will all take that final deep sigh of relief. But as I said, 24/7 world-class medical care surrounding him down there. We’re not going to miss anything that we would have caught up here.

Sean Conley醫生：你說的很對。 這就是為什麼我們都保持謹慎樂觀和警惕， 因為當涉及到一個病人接受處於治療過程的初期階段，我們處於有點未知的領域。我們看這個週末。如果我們順利度過到週一，他的病情保持不變或有所改善，那就更好，那麼我們都會最後深深地松一口氣。但正如我說的，全天候世界級的醫療服務在他那裡就位。任何我們在這裡能做的事情，到那裡也能。

Speaker 10: Where is he physically going to be in the White House? What does that look like? How do you keep him safely quarantined?

記者：他將在白宮的具體什麼位置？那是什麼樣子的？如何讓他安全隔離？

Dr. Sean Conley: I wish I could go into that more, but I just can’t.

Sean Conley醫生：我希望能透露多一些，但我不能。

Speaker 6: Doctor, why did you begin dexamethasone treatment?

記者：醫生，你為什麼要開始地塞米松治療？

Dr. Sean Conley: Yesterday, we talked about that, the several little temporary drops in his oxygen, and we had discussed that as a team and elected to start it early in case that persisted or worsened. The potential risks and side effects, we all discussed. We looked at the data and decided that we’d rather, push ahead on it then hold and risk the opposite.

Sean Conley醫生：昨天，我們說到了這個，他的氧指標有幾次一點點短暫下降，我們團隊討論過，然後選擇提前開始，以防持續或惡化。潛在的風險和副作用，我們都討論過了。我們看過數據，然後決定寧可提前點，而不是延遲而冒著相反的風險。

Speaker 6: What about CT scans and X-rays? What have you seen on his chest X-rays?

記者：CT掃描和X射線檢查如何呢？你在他的胸部X光片上看到了什麼？

Speaker 11: [crosstalk] resume his campaigning?

記者：[交叉發言，無法聽清] 會繼續他的競選活動嗎？

Dr. Sean Conley: As far as travel goes, we’ll see.

Sean Conley醫生：至於旅行，我們要拭目以待。

Speaker 12: Dr. Conley, on his mental status, can you talk about whether he has any neurological symptoms? Does he have any side effects from his medications, any fogginess from the virus?記者：Conley醫生，關於他的精神狀態，能否談談他是否有任何神經系統症狀？有沒有藥物副作用？有沒有病毒引起的霧化？

Dr. Sean Conley: No. I think you’ve seen the videos and now the tweets and you’ll see him shortly. He’s back. Yeah.

Sean Conley醫生：沒有。我想你已經看到了視頻，還有現在的推特，你會很快見到他。他恢復了。是的。

Speaker 6: What about his chest X-rays and CT scans?

記者：他的胸部X光片和CT掃描如何呢？

Speaker 13: Have you seen any evidence of pneumonia or any inflammation in his lungs at all?

記者：你有沒有看到任何肺炎或肺部發炎的證據？

Dr. Sean Conley: We’ve done routine standard imaging, I’m just not at liberty to discuss.

Sean Conley醫生：我們已經做了常規的標準成像，只是我不隨便討論。

Speaker 6: Doctor you were on board Air Force One.

記者：醫生，你在空軍一號上嗎？

Speaker 14: You’re actively not telling us what those lung scans showed, just to be clear.

記者：你不用主動告訴我們那些肺部掃描結果是什麼，只是澄清一下。

Dr. Sean Conley: There are HIPAA rules and regulations that restrict me in sharing certain things for his safety and his own health and reasons.

Sean Conley醫生：有HIPAA的規章制度，為了他的安全和以及他自己的健康和原因，我不能分享某些東西。

Speaker 15: You said his oxygen dropped several times. Can you share how many times he was on oxygen? You said you would check with the nursing staff yesterday.

記者：你說他的含氧指標下降了幾次。你能告訴我他吸了多少次氧嗎？你昨天說你會向護理人員覈實的。

Dr. Sean Conley: Sean Conley醫生：Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Two episodes, like we talked about yesterday, and both times that he received a little bit of oxygen and recovered immediately.

Sean Conley醫生：是的，是的，是的。兩次發作，就像我們昨天談到的， 這兩次他都吸了一點點的氧氣， 並立即恢復了。

Speaker 15: Was it required? Was that oxygen required?

記者：那是需要的嗎？需要吸氧嗎？

Dr. Sean Conley: No, it wasn’t required. He wasn’t short of breath. He wasn’t looking ill. It was more of us trying to anticipate needs and see how he’d respond. In both cases, he came right off. He didn’t need it for very long at all.

Sean Conley醫生：不，這不是必須的。他並沒有喘不上氣。他看起來也沒有生病。更多的是我們想預測他的需求，同時看他會如何反應。在這兩個情況下，他都馬上就好了。他根本沒需要很長時間。

Speaker 6: Doctor, you were on board Air Force One for multiple trips, are you at all concerned about your own exposure and exposure to the medical team?

記者：醫生，你曾多次在 “空軍一號 “上，你一點都不擔心自己接觸病毒，以及傳染給醫療團隊嗎？

Dr. Sean Conley: I am concerned, but as the CDC says, there are caveats for essential employees that as long as you continue to test negative, you remain symptom-free and you keep a mask on when you’re out and about, which we do inside the hospital, 24/7, then you can carry on your duties.

Sean Conley醫生：我擔心的，但正如疾病預防控制中心所說的那樣，對於重要的僱員有一些注意事項，只要你連續檢測呈陰性，保持無症狀，在外出時戴上口罩，我們在醫院內每時每刻就是這樣做的，那麼你就可以履行你的職責了。

Dr. Sean Conley: Yeah?

Sean Conley醫生：是的。

Speaker 10: We all know the president’s an impatient man, has he been itching to get out of here?

記者：我們都知道總統是個不耐煩的人，他是不是很想離開這裡？

Dr. Sean Conley: The president has been a phenomenal patient during his stay here. He’s been working hand in glove with us and the team. Today it got to the point, he’s holding court with those of us around him, the whole team, going over all the specifics, the testing, what the future is, and we have been back and forth on what’s safe, what’s reasonable. He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond a safe and reasonable practice that we all first wanted.

Sean Conley醫生：總統在這裡期間一直是個了不起的病人。他一直在與我們和團隊攜手合作。今天到了關鍵時刻，他和我們這些身邊的人，整個團隊一起，討論所有的具體細節，測試，未來如何，我們一直在來回討論什麼是安全的，什麼是合理的。他從來沒有強迫我們做超出我們所有人首要追求的安全合理的做法的任何事情。

Speaker 16: Was there anybody on this medical team, who recommended against the president leaving here and going back to the White House today?

記者：在這個醫療團隊中，有沒有任何人提議反對總統今天離開這裡回到白宮？

Speaker 16: Or any White House staffers?

記者：或者任何白宮工作人員？

Dr. Sean Conley: No.

Sean Conley醫生：沒有。

Speaker 6: The president said, 「Don’t be afraid of COVID.」 Do you agree with that? Should we not be afraid?

記者：總統說，”不要懼怕COVID。” 你同意嗎？我們應該不懼怕嗎？

Dr. Sean Conley: I’m not going to get into what the president says.

Sean Conley醫生：我不打算討論總統說了什麼。

Speaker 17: You said his heart, liver, and kidney function was normal or improving. Improving, does that mean that there were effects and is it all normal? What’s up with that?

記者：你說他的心、肝、腎功能都正常或改善。改善，那是不是說曾有影響？都正常了？這是怎麼回事？

Dr. Sean Conley: Yeah. It’s all normal right now. I would say he appeared to be a little dehydrated Friday. He was able to just drink and recover from that. Yeah, everything looks great.

Sean Conley醫生：是的，現在一切正常。我想說的是，週五他似乎有點脫水。他能夠只通過飲水恢復過來。是的，一切看起來都很好。

Speaker 18: Doctor, what would you like to see before he starts, resumes campaigning out in the country? What sort of things do you want to see?

記者：醫生，在他開始恢復在全國範圍內的競選活動之前，你想看到什麼？

Dr. Sean Conley: Yeah. The big first thing that we need to do is that there is no evidence of live virus still present that he could possibly transmit to others, and that’s what the infectious disease experts and some of our partners, military, civilian entities doing some of these advanced diagnostics just to see, as soon as we can identify that routinely. We talk about a 10-day window, CDC guidelines, but we’re checking him more routinely than just waiting 10 days. There’s a possibility it’s earlier than that. There’s a chance that it’s a little bit later, but we will know as soon as possible. Then we will look at him clinically. How are you feeling? How are you doing?

Sean Conley醫生：是的，我們需要做的第一件大事是，確認沒有證據表明活病毒仍然存在，由此他可能會傳播給其他人。 這就是傳染病專家和我們的一些合作夥伴， 軍隊，民間實體正在做先進的診斷，就是常規盡早確認；我們談到CDC指南的10天窗口期， 但我們給他更多的日常檢查， 而不是等待10天。有可能比那早些，也有機會稍晚些， 但我們會盡快知道。然後，我們會像在診所那樣給他看病。你感覺怎麼樣？你的情況如何？

Speaker 19: Why have you decided not to use, administer hydroxychloroquine to the president during his time here?

記者：為什麼你決定總統在這裡住院期間不給他使用羥氯喹？

Dr. Sean Conley: I’m not going to go into all of our debates about specific medicines and therapies. There are dozens of therapies that we were made aware of that we considered, that we discussed and debated and looked at the existing literature on. This is the regimen we chose.

Sean Conley醫生：我不打算涉及我們關於具體藥物和療法的所有辯論。我們知曉的，考慮過，討論過，辯論過，看過現有的文獻的，有幾十種治療方法。這是我們選擇的治療方案。

Speaker 19: [crosstalk] hydroxychloroquine.

記者：[交叉發言，無法聽清] 羥氯喹。

Dr. Sean Conley: Yeah?

Sean Conley醫生：請。

Speaker 20: On the symptoms of COVID, is he’s having some of the muscle aches? Has he lost his sense of taste and smell?

記者：關於COVID的症狀，他是不是有一些肌肉疼痛？他是否失去了味覺和嗅覺？

Dr. Sean Conley: No. We were just talking about that, what symptoms he has left. Even the slight cough that he used to have, he doesn’t really complain of at all. He hasn’t ever complained of a muscle aches. Yeah, he’s up and back to him old self, predominantly.

Sean Conley醫生：沒有。我們剛才還說到他還有什麼遺留症狀。即使是曾經有過輕微的咳嗽，他也根本沒有抱怨過。他從來沒有抱怨過肌肉痛。是啊，他基本恢復到了過去。

Speaker 10: You talked about next Monday, just to be clear, how long will he still be actively shedding the virus?

記者：你說的是下週一，我只想確認一下，要多長時間他還能主動地排出病毒？

Dr. Sean Conley: This morning, I believe there was even an accounting by Dr. Fauci referencing a five day, the first five days of illness that people are most likely to shed live virus. There’s a reason there’s the 10 days. It’s because most people, by that time, after seven days, most folks don’t have culturable live virus. They put it to 10, just to give some extra space. It’s never 100% between everybody, so we’ll see. I’m not going to put a specific number, but we look at that window is all I will say.

Sean Conley醫生：今天早上，我相信曾經有一個福西博士的報告提到了五天，人生病的前五天最容易排出活病毒。說10天也是有原因的，是因為大多數人，到了那個時候，七天後大多數人沒有可培養的活病毒。他們把它放到10天，只是為了給一些額外的空間。人與人之間從來沒有100％一致，所以我們將拭目以待。我不會拿出一個具體的數字， 但我想說的就是這個窗口期。

Speaker 21: Doctor, will the president be confined to his residence or will he be allowed to return to the Oval Office?

記者：醫生，總統是會被限制在他的住所，還是會被允許回到橢圓形辦公室？

Dr. Sean Conley: We’re going to do whatever it takes for the president to safely conduct business, whatever it is he needs to do within the residence and White House.

Sean Conley醫生：我們會做一切以便讓總統安全地開展工作，按他所需，無論在住所和白宮內。

Speaker 22: Is he on blood thinners? Also, has he been using, have you been giving him Tylenol, Advil, anything to bring his fever down?

記者：他有使用血液稀釋劑嗎？還有，他有沒有使用，你有沒有給他服用泰諾，愛德維爾，任何能讓他退燒的藥物？

Dr. Sean Conley: Oh, that came up. I would like to say, he has not been on any fever-reducing medications for over 72 hours.

Sean Conley醫生：哦，說到這個，我想說的是，他已經超過72小時沒有服用任何退燒藥了。

Speaker 22: But what about the blood thinners?

記者：但是血液稀釋劑呢？

Dr. Sean Conley: Yeah. He’s on a routine regimen of COVID therapy. I’m not going to go into specifics as to what he is and is not on, but …

Sean Conley醫生：是的，他在接受常規的COVID治療。我不會去到具體細節 關於他是在服用什麼，沒服用什麼 … …

Speaker 23: You said, I’m going to read this here, that the president had a mild cough, some nasal congestion and fatigue on Thursday. Now back to my colleague, John Jacobs question, the reason knowing when the president’s last negative test is important for that reason, your words, what you said, and also for the contract tracing, but would you’ve recommended that given those symptoms that he go, that the president go to that Bedminster fundraiser?

記者：你說過，我來念這個，總統在週四有輕微的咳嗽，一些鼻塞和疲勞。現在回到我的同事John Jacobs的問題，知道總統最後一次檢測結果為陰性的原因是很重要的，你的話，你說過的話，也是為了感染跟蹤，但鑒於他的這些症狀，你會建議讓總統去參加貝明斯特的籌款活動嗎？

Dr. Sean Conley: It’s not up to me, necessarily, the president’s schedule, but I would say that it wasn’t until after he returned that we really sat down, then knowing the news of the day that we really dove into, how are you feeling? What’s going on?

Sean Conley醫生：這不是我說了算，是總統的日程安排，但是我想說，直到他回來之後，我們才真正的坐下來，然後知道了那天的新聞，我們才真正的深入到，你感覺怎麼樣？發生了什麼事情？

Speaker 23: But how was that safe given that those were the symptoms he was experiencing on Thursday?

記者：但是，這些都是他在週四就有的症狀，那怎麼會安全呢？

Dr. Sean Conley: I’m not going to get into operations.

Sean Conley醫生：我不打算談及操作層面。

Speaker 6: Doctor, one last time, when was his last negative test and what was his viral load?

記者：醫生，最後一次，他最後一次檢查呈陰性是什麼時候？病毒載量是多少？

Dr. Sean Conley: I know everyone wants that.

Sean Conley醫生：我知道每個人都想知道這個。

Speaker 6: We’ve been exposed. [crosstalk]

記者：我們已經接觸了。[交叉發言，無法聽清]

Dr. Sean Conley: Yeah. I don’t have his viral load. Those are some of the diagnostics that we’re sending out that will really tell us when it’s safe for him to get back out and around people.

Sean Conley醫生：是的，我不知道他的病毒載量。 我們正在公佈的某些診斷結果將會真實地Sean Conley醫生：告訴我們，什麼時候讓他回去和接觸人是安全的。

Speaker 6: You’ve never had his viral load?

記者：你從來沒有過他的病毒載量？

Speaker 24: Why is it [crosstalk] say when the last negative test was?

記者：[交叉發言，無法聽清] 他最後一次測試呈陰性是什麼時候？

Speaker 25: Did he have any abnormal tests? Were any of his lab tests abnormal?

記者：他有什麼異常的檢查嗎？他的實驗室檢查有異常嗎？

Dr. Sean Conley: Again, HIPAA kind of precludes me from going into too much depth on things that I’m not at liberty or he doesn’t wish to be discussed. At some future point, maybe. But today, I’m sorry. I think that’s it. Yeah.

Sean Conley醫生：再說一次，HIPAA不允許我在一些事上太過深入，我不能隨心所欲或他不願意被討論。也許在未來的某個時點。但今天，我很抱歉。我想就這樣了。

Speaker 26: Thank you, guys, so much.

記者：非常謝謝你，謝謝你們。

Dr. Sean Conley: Thank you.

Sean Conley醫生：謝謝。

Speaker 26: Thank you.

記者：謝謝。
