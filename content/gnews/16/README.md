**Presidential Message on the National Day of Prayer and Return, 2020**

**總統在全國禱告和回歸日的致辭**

2020年9月26日發佈

On this inaugural National Day of Prayer and Return, the First Lady and I join millions of Christians here in the United States and around the world in prayer, as we turn our hearts to our Lord and Savior.

在首屆全國禱告和回歸日這一天，我與第一夫人和美國及世界各地的數百萬基督徒一起祈禱，把我們的心交托給我們的主和救主。

Our great Nation was founded by men and women of deep and abiding faith – a faith that has stood the test of time.  Four hundred years ago, early American settlers trusted their lives to His providence and braved a voyage to a New World.  From the pilgrims who sought His protection aboard the Mayflower to the countless believers who today bow their heads to ask for His guidance during these unprecedented times, our country continues to turn to the Lord.  Following in our ancestors’ footsteps we continue the “firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence” that provides us enduring strength and reassurance in our times of need.

我們偉大的國家由具有深刻和持久信仰的先輩所建立，這種信仰歷經時間的考驗，經久不息。 四百年前，早期的美國定居者將他們的生命托付給上帝，勇敢地航行到另一個新世界。 從登錄 「五月花」號尋求上帝保護的朝聖者，到在今天這個前所未有的時代低頭尋求指引的無數信徒，我們的國家一直信奉著主。 追隨先輩的腳步，我們一直「堅定的依靠神聖上帝的保護」，依靠祂在我們需要時為我們提供的經久不衰的力量和保護。

The trials and tribulations the American people have faced over the past several months have been great.  Yet, as we have seen time and again, the resolve of our citizenry – fortified by our faith in God—has guided us through these hardships and helped to unite us as one Nation under God.  As we continue to combat the challenges ahead of us, we must remember the sage words of President George Washington during his first Presidential Address: “propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right, which Heaven itself has ordained.”  As a country and a people, let us renew our commitment to these abiding and timeless principles.

過去幾個月中，美國人民面臨了巨大的考驗和磨難。 然而，正如我們一再看到的那樣，美國公民因信仰上帝而得到增強的決心引導我們渡過了這些難關，幫助我們因同為上帝庇護的子民而團結在一起。 在繼續應對未來挑戰的同時，我們必須牢記喬治·華盛頓總統在其第一份總統講話中的聖言：如果一個國家無視上天主宰的有關秩序與權利的永恆規則，那麼上天的微笑永遠不會出現。作為一個國家和一個民族，讓我們重拾我們對這些永恆不變的原則的承諾。

Today, I am pleased to join my voice to yours in thanking God for blessing this nation with great power and responsibility.  With reverence, humility, and thanksgiving, we beg for His continued guidance and protection.

今天，我很榮幸與你們一同感謝上帝賜予美國偉大的力量和責任。我們懷著崇敬、謙卑和感恩的心情，祈求他繼續指引和保護我們。
