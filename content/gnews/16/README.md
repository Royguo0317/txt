1215早间要闻-NewYork Time

**LuDe Media 20201215 Morning News, New York Time**

**美国务院发推“中共危害了美国的自由和国家安全”**

**State Department Tweeted “CCP Endangered U.S. Freedom and National Security”**

推文说，美国人必须知道中共如何为自己的目的毒害了我们的高等教育，以及这些行为如何损害了我们的自由和我们的国家安全。这些蓬佩奥早前说过的话，今天由国务院推特账户再次发表，指向性非常明显。

The tweet said Americans must know how the Chinese Communist Party has poisoned our higher education for its own purposes and how those actions have damaged our freedoms and national security. These words, which Pompeo said earlier, were re-posted today by the State Department’s Twitter account, pointing in a quite clear direction.

**大学如何与国家安全相联系**

**How Universities Connected to National Security**

中共对大学的渗透，造成了教育界、学术界和医学界的腐败，导致了全世界主流专家学者无视病毒真相、在閆博士的病毒来源报告面前保持沉默，阻止民众使用羟氯喹，直接导致了美国人民的生命安全和国家经济、国防等各方面安全受到巨大损害。

The Chinese Communist Party’s infiltration of universities has caused corruption in education, academia, and medical community, resulting in mainstream experts and scholars around the world ignoring the truth about the virus and remaining silent in the face of Dr. Yan’s reports on the source of the virus, and preventing the public from taking hydroxychloroquine, and it has directly led to tremendous damage to American lives, economics, defense, and other aspects.

**路德再谈美国沼泽地与生态系统**

**LuDe Talked Again about America Swamp and Ecosystem**

作为美国真正权力一极的哈佛、耶鲁等常青藤学校，是培养美国沼泽地鳄鱼的基地。无论董事会、校长、院长、教授如何变更，这些学校背后的真正老板不会改变，他们或是某个家族，或是其他某个利益集团。

长期以来，美国一直存在沼泽地，范围局限于政客、华尔街等很小的精英圈中，与普通大众的圈子相隔离，各自遵循各自的规则不越界，从而维持了社会生态系统的平衡，推动了美国长期的繁荣和稳定。在这样的生态中，沼泽地的存在始终提醒着民众要小心鳄鱼，要时刻保持警惕、维护自己的安全。

As one pole of the real power in America, the Ivy League schools such as Harvard and Yale are the bases for cultivating alligators of swamp in the United States. No matter how the board of trustees, presidents, deans, and professors change, the real owners behind these schools do not change, either a family or some other interest group.

For a long time, there has been a swamp in the United States, and it is confined to a very small elite circle of politicians, Wall Street, etc., isolated from circles of the general public. These circles follow their own rules without crossing, thus they maintain the balance of the social ecosystem, promoting the long-term prosperity and stability of the United States. In such an ecology, the existence of the swamp always reminds the public to beware of crocodiles and to be alert to maintain their own safeties.

**鳄鱼越界要被消灭**

**Crocodiles Crossing the Border to be ****Exterminated**

在生态系统中，如果鳄鱼越过自己的边界，危及到了其他物种生存和生态系统的平衡，它就会被消灭。当年纽约黑帮将地盘扩大化，危及到了老百姓正常生活和社会正常秩序，就被朱利安尼剿灭了。

In an ecosystem, if a crocodile crosses its border and endangers the survival of other species and the balance of the ecosystem, it will be exterminated. Back then, the New York gangs were eliminated by Giuliani when they expanded their territories and endangered the normal life and social order of ordinary citizens.

**中共渗透美国大学触碰了美国权力的根本，必被灭**

**CCP****‘s Infiltration of U.S. Universities Touched foundation of U.S., Must Be Eliminated**

因为中共将自己不讲游戏规则那一套玩法渗透到大学，传导给教授和学生，将导致整个美国都变成沼泽地，鳄鱼越界到处乱跑，快把沼泽地背后养鳄鱼的人给吃掉了。

美国人今天看清楚中共已经严重越界了，它是要彻底破坏沼泽地的规则、把整个美国变成沼泽地。美国人开始放弃天真的幻想，将以其人之道还治其身对付中共。这就是川普总统突然换下和平时期的司法部长Barr、换上能打大仗的代理部长和副部长的原因。美国对中共的行为规则已经变了。

The CCP’s infiltration of its own set of rules-less game into universities and its transmission to professors and students will cause the entire United States to be a swamp, and all the alligators run around across the borders and are about to eat the people who raise them behind the swamp.

Americans today have seen clearly that the Chinese Communist Party has seriously overstepped its bounds and it is trying to completely break the rules of the swamp and turn the entire United States into a swamp. Now Americans are beginning to give up their naive illusions and will deal with the CCP in the CCP way. This is the reason why President Trump suddenly replaced Barr, the peacetime Attorney General, with an Acting Attorney General and a Deputy Secretary, those who can fight big battles. The rules of American actions against the Chinese Communist Party have changed.

**美国突袭Solarwinds公司获得选举造假铁证**

**U.S. Raid on Solarwinds Got Solid Evidences of Election Fraud**

美国联邦法警、德州骑警和FBI联合行动突袭了Solarwinds公司位于奥斯汀的总部，获取了Dominion系统选票造假的铁证。该行动的级别之高、保密程度之高，前所未见。

A joint operation by the U.S. Marshals, the Texas Rangers and the FBI raided Solarwinds’ headquarter in Austin and obtained solid evidences of ballots fraud in the Dominion system. The operation was unprecedented in its level of rank and secrecy.
