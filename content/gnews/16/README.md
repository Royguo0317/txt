**新聞秘書關於最高法院關於宗教自由的裁決的聲明**

Today’s Supreme Court ruling is a big win for religious freedom and freedom of conscience. Almost a decade ago, the Obama administration attempted to force employers, including religious nonprofits like the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns, to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees, in violation of their religious beliefs. Twice before in this ongoing saga, the Supreme Court has blocked these overly rigid and misguided efforts and sided with religious freedom. Today, it has once again vindicated the conscience rights of people of faith.

今天最高法院的裁決是宗教自由和良心自由的重大勝利。大約十年前，奧巴馬政府試圖強迫雇主其中包括非營利組織， “貧窮的小姐妹”, 是修女的命令，向僱員提供避孕保險。這項命令是違反宗教信仰的。在這場不斷上演的事件中，最高法院已經兩次阻止了這些過於僵化和誤導的努力，並站在支持宗教自由的一邊。今天，它再次彰顯了信仰者的良知權。

Since Day One, the Trump Administration has sought to lift burdens on religious exercise for people of all faiths. As the Supreme Court has previously stated, protecting the ability of people to worship and live according to the dictates of their conscience is part of “the best of our traditions.” The Court’s decision today carries forward that noble tradition. This Administration will continue working to protect healthcare, including contraceptive healthcare, for the American people. Unlike the last administration, however, we have the courage of our convictions: We are allowing women who lack access to contraceptive coverage because of their employer’s religious beliefs or moral convictions to more easily access such care through the Title X program at little to no cost. Ensuring that women receive the healthcare they need does not require banishing religious groups that refuse.

自第一天起，川普政府就一直在努力為所有信仰者們減輕宗教活動負擔。正如最高法院之前所指，保護人們按照自己良心的指引進行崇拜和行動的能力，“是我們最好的傳統”的一部分。最高法院今天的裁決繼承了這一崇高的傳統。本屆政府將為保護美國人民的醫療保健，包括避孕保險而繼續努力。然而，與上屆政府不同之處，我們有堅定信念的勇氣：我們允許那些因受到雇主的宗教信仰和道德信念不同而無法獲得避孕保險的婦女們，通過Title X計畫付費很少或免費獲得這種保健。確保婦女們在獲取她們所需要的醫療保健時，無須因拒絕放棄自己的宗教信仰作為交換條件而被社會所拋棄。
