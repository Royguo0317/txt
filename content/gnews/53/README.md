> **Part II:**
> 
> **Point-to-Point Responses to “Reviewers” from Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security**
> 
> On Sep 21st, Kelsey Lane Warmbrod, MS, MPH; Rachel M. West, Ph.D.; Nancy D. Connell, Ph.D.; and Gigi Kwik Gronvall, Ph.D.; all from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security published a “peer review” commenting on our scientific report “*Unusual Features of the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Suggesting Sophisticated Laboratory Modification Rather Than Natural Evolution and Delineation of Its Probable Synthetic Route*“. Their writing can be found on their website. While peer review is a mechanism to ensure the robustness of a scientific publication, it is to be provided by scientists with matching expertise. However, unfortunately, the comments offered by Warmbrod et al. showed clearly that these self-claimed “reviewers” do not have adequate knowledge in any of the relevant areas of biology, including virology, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, structural biology, and biochemistry. A closer look at the background of the “reviewers” showed that, indeed, none of the four scientists has worked on coronavirus or on any aspect of virology. More importantly, Warmbrod et al. repeatedly distorted our descriptions in their comments and then inserted their otherwise unjustified criticisms. Their intention to mislead the public and muddle the water on the true origin of SARS-CoV-2 could not be more evident. Dr. Yan and her co-authors always welcome evidence-based, logical, and honest scientific discussions on the Yan reports. However, we condemn pretentious and dishonest “peer reviews” of our reports. We believe that the significant amount of incorrect information provided in Warmbrod et al.’s criticisms pose threat to the world’s understanding of the origin of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, here we provide point-to-point responses to their criticisms, which we hope would provide clarity to issues muddled by Warmbrod et al. and help the scientific community and the general public better understand our original report and the true origin of SARS-CoV-2.


【闫博士】第二部分

点对点回应约翰·霍普金斯健康保障中心的评议

9月21日，凯尔西·莱恩·沃姆布罗德（MS，MPH），雷切尔·M·韦斯特（PhD），南希·D·康奈尔（PhD），吉吉·奎克·格龙瓦尔（PhD），四人都来自约翰·霍普金斯健康保障中心，就我们的报告“新冠基因的不寻常特征表明它由实验室改造的本质而非源于自然进化，以及可能的合成途径”，发表了一篇“同行评议”。此评议可以在他们的网站上找到。倘若“同行评议”是为了确保出版物坚实的科学性时，它会由旗鼓相当的科学家给出。然而很不幸，由沃姆布罗德等人给出的评议清楚地显示出，这些自称“评议者”的人在所有相关的生物学领域都没有足够的知识，这包括病毒学、分子生物学、进化生物学、结构生物学和生物化学。仔细看看这些评议者的背景就会发现，其实这四位科学家无一人在冠状病毒或其他病毒学领域工作过。更重要的是，沃姆布罗德等人不断地在评议中歪曲我们的叙述，然后插入他们的不公正的批评。很明显，他们故意要误导公众，并且要把新冠起源真相的水搅浑。闫博士和她的合作者们从来欢迎对于其报告的基于证据、合乎逻辑的、真诚的科学讨论。我们相信，由沃姆布罗德等人的批评提供的大量的不正确的信息，给世界了解新冠起源真相造成了威胁。所以，我们对他们的批评提出点对点回应，希望以此把被沃姆布罗德等人搅浑的水澄清，并帮助科学界和大众更好地了解我们原本的报告，以及新冠起源真相。


> 1. **On the natural existence of a closely related virus. **Line 17: RaTG13 is a previously discovered bat coronavirus that has about a 96% sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that it is a close relative and that bats are likely involved in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Yan et al question the existence of RaTG13, which is found in GenBank. The authors cite multiple papers in their reference section that have weaknesses or flaws to make their case. In their paper, reference 7’s author is not a scientist or researcher according to his ORCID profile; references 10 and 13 cannot be found online and the links provided are not active; reference 11 is an opinion piece on an anti-GMO interest group website; references 5, 6, 8, 9, and 12 appear to be authored by scientists lacking expertise in coronaviruses and/or viral evolution. Only 2 of these publications (14 and 15) were published in scientific journals with peer review, and none of the authors of these 2 articles specialize in coronaviruses or viral genetics.


【评议者】

1. 关于一种高度近似病毒的自然存在。


第17行，RaTG13是之前发现的与新冠有96%相似度的冠状病毒，说明它高度相似并很可能与新冠的演变有关联。闫等人质疑RaTG13的存在，而它是存在于基因库里的。作者在参考资料里引证了多份论文，但都很弱或有瑕疵，因此不足为据。参考资料7中，根据其前言，作者并非科学家或研究员。资料10和13在网上找不到，链接无效。资料11是一份反对转基因的网站上的观点资料。资料5、6、8、9和12似乎是由缺少冠状病毒和/或病毒演变的专业知识的科学家们写的。只有14和15这两份是在同行评议杂志上发表的，但作者都非冠状病毒或病毒基因专家。


> Response: Contrary to the reviewers’ claim, references 5, 6, 8, 9, and 12 were produced by scientists, whom all have backgrounds related to infectious disease and/or virology. In contrast, Warmbrod et al. have no background in virology at all.
> 
> The original link for our reference 13 is indeed broken. In fact, it only became broken after our report was published. The author of reference 13 had reposted his article here, where he also posted a note explaining how the link to his article had become broken right after our report was published:
> 
> “*Author’s Note – This is a reposting of the original article posted on LinkedIn on April 2, 2020. Something strange happened in September. The link to my original article was severed sometime two days after Dr. Li-Meng Yan’s paper was published on Sep. 14, 2020. Dr. Yan’s paper, unbeknownst to me, quoted my original article as Reference #13. A LinkedIn connection of mine informed me of the severed link on Sep. 19, 2020. Another LinkedIn connection confirmed on the same day the severed access to my original article and noted that he could access the article two days after publication of Dr. Yan’s paper, on Sep. 16. So later on Sep. 19, I sent a message to LinkedIn CEO, Mr. Ryan Roslansky, inquiring about the reason for the severance. LinkedIn’s Customer Support later replied that ‘*a *bug is preventing us from releasing the article to the site’ and asked me to repost the article. So here it is.”*
> 
> Warmbrod et al. were also mistaken on reference 10. The online link of this reference is valid. Reference 11 is an opinion piece, however, the scientists who offered opinions within this report were clearly experts in their respective fields.
> 
> We do not know whether the author of reference 7 is a scientist or not. The scientific merits and critical thinking of this reference are significant, which are the criteria that we followed for selecting our references. It was nothing but appropriate for us to cite this article in our report.
> 
> Importantly, contrary to the reviewer’s claim, RaTG13 is a fabricated virus. We have provided substantial scientific evidence in the final paragraph of section 1.1 in our report, which showed that the existence of RaTG13 in nature is questionable. **More importantly, we have published our second report, which presented overwhelming evidence and analyses proving the fraudulent nature of RaTG13. **To possibly dismiss our conclusion here, the reviewers have to come up with a valid, evidence-based counter-argument to prove the validity of RaTG13.


【闫博士】回应：

与评议者所说恰恰相反，资料5、6、8、9和12都是由具备传染疾病或病毒学背景的科学家写的，而沃姆布罗德等人却毫无病毒学背景。

资料13的原始链接确实坏了。事实上，它就是在我们的报告发表后坏的。该作者已经在新链接重发了文章，文中他还解释了为什么之前的链接在我们的报告发表后坏了：

“作者声明：这是2020年4月2日原始文章的重发。九月份时发生了一些怪事。原始文章的链接在闫博士2020年9月14日的报告发表的两天后被损坏了。我并不知道闫博士引用了我的原始文章作为资料13。2020年9月19日，一个领英的链接告知我这个损坏的消息。另一个领英链接同日确认这一对我原文访问的失败，他还注意到，在9月16日，闫博士报告发表后不到两天时，他还能访问我的原文。于是我在9月19日给领英CEO Ryan Roslansky先生发信息征询这一损坏的原因。领英的客服随后回答说，一个bug正在阻止他们把该文放到网上，并要求我重发。于是就这样了。”

沃姆布罗德等人对于资料10也犯了错误，这个网上链接是有效的。资料11是一份观点文章，但是提供该文的科学家们很明显都是各自领域的专家。

我们不知道资料7的作者是否是科学家。但其文章的科学价值和批判性思维是显著的，这正是我们选取资料的价值标准。就因为这一点，我们在报告里引用了它。

重要的是，与评议者的声明相反，RaTG13是伪造的病毒。我们已经在报告1.1的最后一段提供了大量的科学证据，显示RaTG13在自然界的存在是可疑的。更重要的是，我们已经发表了第二篇报告，提供了压倒性证据和分析，证明了RaTG13的伪造本质。想要否定我们的结论，评议者必须提出有效的、有依据的相反论点来证明RaTG13的有效性。


> 2. **On the capacity to predict function from genotype. **Line 28: Yan et al overstate the capabilities of deducing functional changes from genetic manipulation of coronaviruses, referring to an “abundant literature indicat[ing] that gain-of-function research has long advanced to the stage where viral genomes can be precisely engineered and manipulated to enable the creation of novel coronaviruses possessing unique properties.” Technologies like CRISPR have enabled precise, directed gene editing, and are major advances for the biological sciences. However, the report overstates current capabilities in designing phenotypes and genetic functions of viruses, which are not already elucidated, including coronaviruses, and vastly overstates the capabilities of genetic manipulation of coronaviruses in 2019, before these viruses were the focus of worldwide interrogation by the scientific community. There were 6 coronaviruses known to infect humans prior to 2020, but their prevalence and pathology in different age groups are incompletely understood, which would hamper any potential design of novel coronavirus functions. Prior to 2020, coronaviruses were not as intensely researched as other viruses that cause human diseases, such as HIV, and influenza.


【评议者】

2、关于能否从基因类型预测其功能。第28行，闫等人夸大了由冠状病毒基因重组而导致其功能变化，靠引用“大量文献显示，功能获得性研究已经长期进行至病毒基因组能被精确地加工和操作，而能制造拥有特殊属性的新冠状病毒的阶段”这句话。像CRISPR这样的技术令精确直接的基因编辑变得可能，是生物科学的重大进展。可是，报告夸大了目前设计病毒表型和基因功能的能力，那些还没有被阐释，包括冠状病毒。因而，其极大高估了2019年时冠状病的毒基因改造能力——此时它们尚未成为焦点，还没有引起世界范围科学界的审查。2020年之前，据说有6个冠状病毒能感染人类，但它们在不同年龄组别的患病率和症状都已被一定程度上知晓，这在一定程度上，会阻碍任何可能的新冠状病毒功能的设计。2020年前，冠状病毒没有被像其他引起人类疾病的病毒，例如艾滋病毒和禽流感病毒那样，被热烈地研究过。


> Response: Warmbrod et al. are mistaken in stating that there is a lack of capabilities in gain-of-function research in coronaviruses. Instead, genetic manipulation of coronaviruses has been done extensively as evidenced by the literature. Gain-of-function research where certain genes are engineered and manipulated in a specific manner has led to novel coronaviruses capable of using the human ACE2 receptor for infections. The corresponding description in our report was a fair statement of the current capabilities, not an overstatement. Dr. Ralph Baric, who is the top expert in constructing synthetic coronaviruses, stated in September 2020 that “*you can engineer a virus without leaving any trace*“.
> 
> Warmbrod et al. clearly lack knowledge in the status and development of coronavirus research in the past two decades.
> 
> Furthermore, coronavirus research is especially extensive and proliferic in China. Since the SARS epidemic in 2003, the coronavirus research in China has enjoyed two decades-long, sustained support from the CCP government. As a result, labs under the control of the CCP have the largest collections of coronaviruses (both sequences and physical samples) as well as ample experience in gain-of-function research in this area.
> 
> Finally, the fact that all past coronaviruses were only modestly prevalent and SARS-CoV-2 caused a worldwide pandemic uniquely speaks for, not against, the suspicious nature of SARS-CoV-2. Natural occurring coronaviruses have never led to this scale of a pandemic or caused this many deaths worldwide.


【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人说冠状病毒功能获得性研究方面的能力不足，这是错误的。相反，如文献6-15所示，冠状病毒基因改造已被广泛实施。对特定基因以特定方式进行改造加工的功能获得性研究，已导致新冠状病毒有能力利用人类受体进行感染。我们报告中的叙述只是对目前能力的白描，没有夸张。拉尔夫·巴里克博士是构建人造冠状病毒的顶尖专家，他在2020年说过，“人们能够不留任何痕迹地改造某个病毒”。

显然，沃姆布罗德等人对过去二十年里冠状病毒研究的发展和状态缺乏了解。

更进一步的是，冠状病毒研究在中（共）国尤其广泛而成果丰富。因为2003年SARS的流行，CCP控制下的实验室有了最大量的冠状病毒（基因和物理样本），同时做了此一领域的大量功能获得性研究。

最后，过去的冠状病毒仅仅适度流行而新冠造成的是世界性流行，这一事实更加说明（而非与之矛盾）新冠的可疑本质。自然出现的冠状病毒从未导致世界上如此大范围的流行和如此多的死亡。


> 3. **Lack of current evidence countering natural origin theory. **Line 27: Yan et al refer to an extensive scientific literature providing “genomic, structural, and literature evidence” to counter the prevailing theory in the scientific community that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is a natural zoonosis, emerging from animals, but they do not cite any references to support their claim—a crucial basic practice for any researcher.


【评议者】

3. 目前缺乏与自然起源理论相反的证据。第27行，闫等人引证了大量科学文献，提供了“基因的、结构的和文献的证据”，以反对科学界主流的新冠是自然起源的，其是动物传染性的，亦是在动物中出现的理论。但他们并没有引证任何参考资料支持他们的声明—— 一个对于任何研究人员都是决定性的基本事实。


> Response: Apparently, Warmbrod et al. failed to understand that our whole report was dedicated to providing such genomic, structural, and literature evidence to prove that SARS-CoV-2 is an unnatural virus. If Warmbrod et al. keep on reading from this line 27, later in the same paragraph they would have found our statement that “*(i)n this report, we present such evidence and the associated analyses.*” Consistent with this statement, genetic, structural, and literature evidence was described, analyzed, and discussed in great detail throughout our report. The inability of Warmbrod et al. to recognize this is astonishing. It shows that they are either very poor in their quality as scientists or intentionally misleading in writing this comment.


【闫博士】回应：

显然，沃姆布罗德等人根本就读不懂我们这一提供了如此多基因的、结构的和文献的证据证明新冠是非自然病毒的论文。如果沃姆布罗德等人继续从第27行读下去就会看到，在同一段里写着，“在这篇报告里，我们提供了如此多的证据和相关分析”。与之相一致地，报告里高度详细地陈述了基因的、结构的和文献的证据。沃姆布罗德等人如此缺乏能力认识到（这些证据）是令人震惊的。这说明，他们要么是作为科学家的素质太差，要么是故意要误导而写下这些评议的。


> 4. **On implausibility of the proposed viral genetic backbone. **Lines 19-20: Scientific evidence suggests that many coronaviruses12 similar to SARS-CoV-2 have a recent common ancestor or that convergent evolution has occurred. Many coronaviruses infect bats and other animals, most of which have not been analyzed, so the evolutionary record has gaps until more samples are collected. Convergent evolution refers to the evolution of similar traits in independent organisms. Yan et al do not attempt to refute the prevailing scientific evidence on viral evolution but assert that ZC45, a coronavirus with over 3,000 punctuated, broadly distributed nucleotide differences from SARS-CoV-2 (a significantly large number of differences), could have been used as a “backbone” or template to produce SARS-CoV-2 synthetically. ZC45 is a beta coronavirus isolated from a bat between 2015 and 2017 in Zhoushan city, Zhejiang province, China. ZC45 and ZXC21 were both discovered and characterized to better understand animal reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses. No explanation is given for how the over 3,000 nucleotide differences SARS-CoV-2 and ZC45 could be produced; this process would be highly challenging for deliberate engineering.


【评议者】

关于难以置信的假设的基因改造骨架。19-20行，科学证据显示，很多与新冠相似的冠状病毒拥有一个最近的共同先祖，或是发生过趋同进化。许多冠状病毒感染过蝙蝠或其他动物，其中大部分都被分析过了，于是进化记录留下空当，直到更多的样本得到了收集。趋同进化指向独立生物的类似特质的进化。闫等人不尝试反驳主流的病毒进化的科学证据，却断言ZC45，一种有超过3000个差异的，与新冠有大量（巨大的差异）核苷酸差异的病毒，可能被用作骨架或模板来合成制造新冠。ZC45是2015至2017年在中国浙江省舟山市提取的一种β冠状病毒。ZC45和ZXC21都被发现和归类进了用于理解SARS的动物储备冠状病毒。（报告）对ZC45和新冠的超过3000个核苷酸的差异是如何产生的没有解释，这个流程作为刻意的基因工程挑战太大。


> Response: Our report did not deny that β coronaviruses exist and evolve in nature. Our assertion on the use of ZC45/ZXC21 as the template for the creation of SARS-CoV-2 was based on various genetic evidence, including the 100% identity on the E protein between SARS-CoV-2 and ZC45/ZXC21, as well as the fact that a fabricated RaTG13 virus was used to specifically make people overlook the connection between ZC45/ZXC21 and SARS-CoV-2.
> 
> However, although SARS-CoV-2 was created based on ZC45/ZXC21, during its creation, changes must have been introduced to obscure the genetic connection between the two. In addition, some random mutations must have also accumulated when the assembled, live virus was developed in subsequent experiments, which should have further contributed to the overall genetic divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and ZC45/ZXC21. If no changes were introduced, the weaponized virus could be immediately traced back to its backbone, revealing the true identity of not only this novel viral pathogen but also the scientists involved in its creation.


【闫博士】回应：

我们的报告没有否认β冠状病毒在自然界里的存在和进化。我们断言ZC45/ZXC21是制造新冠的模板，是基于各种基因证据的，包括新冠和ZC45/ZXC21之间E蛋白的100%一致性，以及伪造的RaTG13被特意用作引导人们忽视ZC45/ZXC21和新冠的联系这一事实。如果没有别的介入，这一武器病毒立刻就会被追溯到它的骨架，不仅揭示出这新病毒的身份，也揭示出参与的科学家。


> In our report, we have delineated how sequence differences could be introduced (section 2.2 and Figure 7) during the creation of SARS-CoV-2 using ZC45/ZXC21 as a template. For the Spike protein, in addition to the modified RBM, the rest of the sequence would have changes introduced at the initial step, which is DNA synthesis. The Orf1b gene should have been taken from another SARS-like coronavirus, RaBtCoV/4991, which would differ naturally from ZC45/ZXC21. Two likely reasons for the use of this specific Orf1b have been described in section 2.1 of our report. The rest of the genome also could be obtained through DNA synthesis, where changes can be easily introduced.
> 
> Here, the introduced changes are of two types. First, they could introduce synonymous mutations. Although ZC45/ZXC21 and SARS-CoV-2 are 89% identical to each other on the nucleotide level, they are 95% identical on the amino acid level. Clearly, over half of the nucleotide differences are synonymous mutations, which do not alter protein structure or functions. In fact, as shown in the literature, codon-optimization had been done successfully for Spike6, which entails that synonymous mutations can be safely introduced into the spike gene. The same could be easily applied to other sections of the genome. Second, amino acid changes could be introduced into variable regions/positions of a protein without affecting its structure or function. This could be safely guided by multi-sequence alignment of the many SARS and SARS-like virus sequences, which the WIV has in great abundance. The process of introducing changes, both synonymous mutations, and amino acid substitutions, into a template virus has been nicely illustrated in a 2008 publication (Figure S1 of this article).
> 
> Finally, we do not rule out the possibility that some changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome could have been introduced to enable novel functions. It remains to be revealed whether certain complications associated with COVID-19, some of which are rare or non-existent in other coronavirus infections, are results of intentional design. This speaks to the necessity of treating SARS-CoV-2 for what it really is. Without acknowledging its true nature as a bioweapon and obtaining all the details of its creation, the world may continue to be misled to overlook key aspects of this pathogen and thereby suffer severely from it for a long period of time.


【闫博士】回应：

在报告里我们描述了，在以ZC45/ZXC21为模板制造新冠的过程中，基因差异可以被引入（2.2和图7）。因为刺突蛋白除了在改造的受体绑定域外，其余的序列差异可以在初始步骤就引入，用基因合成。Orf1b可能被取自于另一个SARS类冠状病毒，RaBtCoV/4991，那就能自然地与ZC45/ZXC21不同。在我们报告的2.1中给出了使用特定Orf1b的两个理由。其余部分的基因可以通过基因重组获得，轻松引入变异。

变异有两种，一是他们可以引入同义变异。尽管ZC45/ZXC21和新冠在核苷酸水平上是89%一致，在氨基酸水平上却是95%。显然，超过半数的核苷酸差异是同义变异，那并不改变蛋白质结构和功能。事实上，如文献中所示，刺突的密码子已经被成功地最优化了，这说明同义变异可以安全地被引入刺突基因。基因组的其他部分也可以如法炮制。第二，氨基酸变异可以被引入蛋白质的不同区域或位置而不影响其结构和功能。这可以被安全地由许多SARS和SARS类病毒多序列比对来引导——WIV对此手到擒来。把包括同义的和氨基酸的变异引入病毒模板的过程，已经在2008年的出版物中得到了图示（该文的图 S1）。

最后，我们并不排除新冠基因组的一些变异可能被引入用于新的功能的可能性。与新冠肺炎关联的并发症（其中有些是其他冠状病毒中罕见或没有的）是否是刻意设计的结果，这有待于被揭示。这也说明，要按照新冠的本来面目来治疗它的必要性。不知道它的生物武器本质以及所有制造细节，世界可能会继续被误导而忽视此病毒的关键方面，因而在很长时间里吃它的苦头。

【笔者浅释】同义变异是不改变蛋白质结构和功能的，就好比房子的填充墙不吃力，与结构无关。氨基酸变异虽然看似关系到结构，也毕竟有主次、轻重、好多层次，好比房子的梁，也分为主梁、次梁、再次梁，以及联系梁稳定性构造梁等等，有些梁并不怎么吃力。所以，通过改变填充墙（同义变异）和改变不怎么吃力的构造梁（不同区域的氨基酸变异）来制造表面上相当大的不同（超过3000个核苷酸的差异）并不影响新冠和它的模板ZC45/ZXC21的内在一致性。

多序列比对大家从字面就可以理解，把相似的序列排起来比对，就能看到哪些片段是一样的。这些保守度高的片段通常对应重要的功能，而保守度低的区域在功能上可能相对次要——氨基酸变异就可能被引入到这些区域而不影响病毒的功能。当然，这只是粗浅的通俗解释，实际操作时分析复杂，计算量巨大。
