**The men always wore masks, Tursunay Ziawudun said, even though there was no pandemic then.**

**图撒娜****·****齐亚乌敦（****Tursunay Ziawudun****）说，尽管那时没有疫情，但这些人总是戴着口罩。**

They wore suits, she said, not police uniforms.

她说，他们穿西装，而不是警察制服。

Sometime after midnight, they came to the cells to select the women they wanted and took them down the corridor to a “black room”, where there were no surveillance cameras.

午夜后的某个时候，他们来到牢房挑选想要的女人，然后将她们带到走廊另一头的“黑屋”，那里没有监控摄像头。

Several nights, Ziawudun said, they took her.

图撒娜·齐亚乌敦说到，有几个晚上，他们带走了她。

“Perhaps this is the most unforgettable scar on me forever,” she said.

她说：“也许这是我永远最难以抹去的伤疤。”

“I don’t even want these words to spill from my mouth.”

“我甚至不希望这些话从我的口中说出。”

Tursunay Ziawudun spent nine months inside China’s vast and secretive system of internment camps in the Xinjiang region. According to independent estimates, more than a million men and women have been detained in the sprawling network of camps, which China says exist for the “re-education” of the Uighurs and other minorities.

图撒娜·齐亚乌敦在中国庞大而隐秘的新疆集中营中度过了九个月的时间。 据几个独立估测，在遍布新疆各地的集中营中，有超过一百万男女被拘禁。中（共）国称，这是为了维吾尔族和其他少数民族的“再教育”。

Human rights groups say the Chinese government has gradually stripped away the religious and other freedoms of the Uighurs, culminating in an oppressive system of mass surveillance, detention, indoctrination, and even forced sterilisation.

人权组织说，中（共）国政府逐渐地剥夺了维吾尔族民众的宗教自由和其他自由，最终实施了残酷的系统性的大规模监控，随意拘禁，思想灌输甚至强迫绝育。

The policy flows from China’s President, Xi Jinping, who visited Xinjiang in 2014 in the wake of a terror attack by Uighur separatists. Shortly after, according to documents leaked to the New York Times, he directed local officials to respond with “absolutely no mercy”. The US government said last month that China’s actions since amounted to a genocide. China says reports of mass detention and forced sterilisation are “lies and absurd allegations”.

该政策源于中（共）国国家主席习近平。2014年，在维吾尔族分裂分子发动恐怖袭击后，习近平访问了新疆。 据泄露给《纽约时报》的文件，访问新疆不久后，他指示地方官员以“绝不怜悯的”态度应对新疆问题。 美国政府上个月表示，自那以来，中（共）国的行动等同于种族灭绝。 而中（共）国则称，有关大规模拘禁和强迫绝育的报道是“谎言和荒谬的指控”。

First-hand accounts from inside the internment camps are rare, but several former detainees and a guard have told the BBC they experienced or saw evidence of an organised system of mass rape, sexual abuse and torture.

集中营内的第一手资料很少见，但几名前被拘禁者和一名警卫告诉BBC，他们亲身经历，或看到了有组织的系统性的大规模强奸，性虐待和酷刑的证据。

Tursunay Ziawudun, who fled Xinjiang after her release and is now in the US, said women were removed from the cells “every night” and raped by one or more masked Chinese men. She said she was tortured and later gang-raped on three occasions, each time by two or three men.

图撒娜·齐亚乌敦获释后逃离新疆，现居美国。她说，妇女“每晚”都被从牢房中带走，并被一个或多个蒙面中国男子强奸。 她说，她遭到了酷刑，后来被轮奸三次，每次都有两或三个男人。

Ziawudun has spoken to the media before, but only from Kazakhstan, where she “lived in constant fear of being sent back to China”, she said. She said she believed that if she revealed the extent of the sexual abuse she had experienced and seen, and was returned to Xinjiang, she would be punished more harshly than before. And she was ashamed, she said.

图撒娜·齐亚乌敦以前曾在哈萨克斯坦向媒体发声：“她一直担心被送回中（共）国。”她相信，如果她揭露自己经历的和看到的严重的性虐待，并被送回新疆，她将受到比以往更加严厉的惩罚。 她说，她感到羞愧。

It is impossible to verify Ziawudun’s account completely because of the severe restrictions China places on reporters in the country, but travel documents and immigration records she provided to the BBC corroborate the timeline of her story. Her descriptions of the camp in Xinyuan county – known in Uighur as Kunes county – match satellite imagery analysed by the BBC, and her descriptions of daily life inside the camp, as well as the nature and methods of the abuse, correspond with other accounts from former detainees.

由于中（共）国对记者的严格限制，不可能完全核实图撒娜·齐亚乌敦的说法，但是她提供给BBC的旅行证件和移民记录证实了她故事的时间表。她对位于新源县-在维吾尔语中称为库内斯县-的集中营的描述，与BBC分析的卫星图像相符，她对集中营内日常生活以及虐待行为的性质和方法的描述与其他被拘禁者的说法一致。

Internal documents from the Kunes county justice system from 2017 and 2018, provided to the BBC by Adrian Zenz, a leading expert on China’s policies in Xinjiang, detail planning and spending for “transformation through education” of “key groups” – a common euphemism in China for the indoctrination of the Uighurs. In one Kunes document, the “education” process is described as “washing brains, cleansing hearts, strengthening righteousness and eliminating evil”.

研究中（共）国新疆政策的权威专家阿德里安·曾茨（Adrian Zenz）曾为BBC提供了2017年和2018年库内斯县司法系统的内部文件，指出了对“关键群体”的“教育转型”（这是中（共）国对维吾尔族人进行思想灌输的委婉说法）的详细计划与支出情况。在一份库内斯县的文件中，“教育”过程被描述为“洗脑，洗心，增强公义和消除邪恶”。

The BBC also interviewed a Kazakh woman from Xinjiang who was detained for 18 months in the camp system, who said she was forced to strip Uighur women naked and handcuff them, before leaving them alone with Chinese men. Afterwards, she cleaned the rooms, she said.

BBC还采访了一名来自新疆的哈萨克族妇女，该妇女在集中营中被拘禁了18个月。她说她被迫将维吾尔族妇女的衣服脱光并给她们戴上手铐，然后将她们单独留给中国男人们。 她说，事后，她负责打扫房间。

“My job was to remove their clothes above the waist and handcuff them so they cannot move,” said Gulzira Auelkhan, crossing her wrists behind her head to demonstrate. “Then I would leave the women in the room and a man would enter – some Chinese man from outside or policeman. I sat silently next to the door, and when the man left the room I took the woman for a shower.”

古尔吉拉·奥埃尔汗（Gulzira Auelkhan）说：“我的工作是脱掉她们腰部以上的衣服，并给他们戴上手铐，这样他们就不能动弹了。”她一边说，一边把双手交叉放在脑后，演示被铐上的状态。然后，我把女人留在房间里，一个男人进来，男人是来自外面的中国男人或警察。 我安静地坐在门旁边，当男人离开房间时，我带女人去冲澡。”

The Chinese men “would pay money to have their pick of the prettiest young inmates”, she said.

她说，中国男人“愿意付钱挑选最年轻漂亮的被拘禁人员”。

Some former detainees of the camps have described being forced to assist guards or face punishment. Auelkhan said she was powerless to resist or intervene.

一些先前集中营的被拘禁者也描述自己被迫协助警卫或受到惩罚。 奥埃尔汉说，她无力抵抗，也无力干预。

Asked if there was a system of organised rape, she said: “Yes, rape.”

当被问及是否存在有组织的强奸制度时，她说：“是的，强奸。”

“They forced me to go into that room,” she said. “They forced me to take off those women’s clothes and to restrain their hands and leave the room.”

她说：“他们强迫我进入那个房间。他们强迫我脱掉那些女人的衣服，束缚住她们的双手，然后离开房间。”

Some of the women who were taken away from the cells at night were never returned, Ziawudun said. Those who were brought back were threatened against telling others in the cell what had happened to them.

齐亚乌敦说，一些夜间从牢房被带走的妇女从未返回。而那些被带回来的人则受到威胁，不能告诉牢房中的其他人发生了什么事。

“You can’t tell anyone what happened, you can only lie down quietly,” she said. “It is designed to destroy everyone’s spirit.”

她说：“你不能告诉任何人发生了什么，只能安静地躺着。这种行为旨在摧毁每个人的精神支柱。”

Mr Zenz told the BBC that the testimony gathered for this story was “some of the most horrendous evidence I have seen since the atrocity began”.

曾茨先生告诉BBC，为这篇报道而收集的证词“是自暴行开始以来我所见过的最恐怖的证据之一”。

“This confirms the very worst of what we have heard before,” he said. “It provides authoritative and detailed evidence of sexual abuse and torture at a level clearly greater than what we had assumed.”

他说：“这证实了我们以前听到的最糟糕的情况。它提供了有关性虐待和酷刑的权威和详尽的证据，其严重程度明显超出了我们的预期。”
