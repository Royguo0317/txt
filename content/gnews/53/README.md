简述：郭先生在2021年3月30的GTV直播中说拜登政府的人不会跟着拜登家族去亲共，好莱坞和华尔街大佬一起开会，讨论从中国撤资和全面推动政府灭共，他们感谢郭先生的爆料革命改变了世界和美国。



**好莱坞和华尔街一起商讨灭共****  ****感谢郭先生的爆料革命帮助了美国**

**Hollywood and Wall Street Are on the Same Page on Taking Down the CCP**

拜登政府的国防部长、拜登政府的国务卿、拜登政府的所有，包括副总统Harris，最近在华盛顿圈里边炸了锅了。

The Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and all others in the Biden Administration, including Vice President Harris, have been on fire in the Washington circle recently.

昨天下午，有一个美国沼泽地的九十多岁的大佬，给我打电话说：“Miles，世界在变化。”我说：“有什么变？” “拜登政府认识到了，所有下边的人都知道，都知道享特.拜登和拜登总统和中共的关系，每个人都不想沾这个锅，每个人不想牵涉进去，而且这些人都很明确宁可老子不干，也不会跟着你说亲共去。而且现在很多人说，你要让我在这儿干，那就得灭共。”

Yesterday afternoon, a bigwig of the swampland, who is over 90 years old, called me, “Miles, the world is changing.” I said, “What are the changes?” He said, “The Biden Administration has realized it. All the people within the administration know the relationship among Hunter Biden, President Biden, and the CCP. Nobody wants to get wet on this. No one wants to get involved in it. And these people are very clear that they would rather quit than become pro-CCP. Moreover, now, many people said that if you want me to continue working here, then we need to take down the CCP.”

最关键的事情就是今年的“以毒灭共”。战友们你记住，七哥过去四年直播当中说的这些五大家族、七大机构，所有这些人都是推动整个灭共最核心力量。彭佩奥、Pottinger（博明）、Miles余、皮特.纳瓦罗，大家看到了吧？整个川普总统的系列，我们的班农兄弟，还有一堆的现在。现在三个史蒂夫都出来了。 那天听娜塔丽去讲那个 Patrick 的时候，你看她讲得多好，这背后都有人，这背后都有力量。

The most crucial thing is this year’s goal of “taking down the CCP by spreading the truth of the virus”. Fellow fighters, please remember the Five Big Families and Seven Big Agencies that I have mentioned during my live broadcasts in the past four years. All these people are the most central power that advances the process of taking down the CCP. Pompeo, Pottinger, Miles Yu and Peter Navarro, do you see it? The whole President Trump Team, our brother Bannon, and many more now, including three Steves, have all stood out. The other day, I heard Natalie talking about Patrick. Such a great talk. There were forces and people behind all this.

我还想告诉大家，这不算重磅，好莱坞几个大佬刚刚地在黄石公园开过会。好莱坞第一次几个大佬互相仇恨的，不一定好莱坞大佬都是一家人，包括我隔壁这个家伙。所有人开会说就是研究共产党，基本最后都认为共产党是他们的过去是挣钱的所谓的钱袋子，但是他们觉得所有的人、钱、安全、利益、未来、家人都受到了共产党的威胁。这次H&M，还有耐克、新疆棉花事件让他们更加意识到，他们了解了很多真相，也受到了威胁。这些人已经研究好尽快地从大陆撤出来资金，包括要全面推动政府一起灭共寻找病毒真相。

I also want to share with everyone, which is not a bombshell, that several bigwigs in Hollywood just held a meeting in Yellowstone. This was the first time for the big shots in the Hollywood, who used to hate each other, to hold a meeting together. It is not necessarily true that Hollywood big shots all get along like a family, including the guy living next door to me. They attended the meeting to focus on studying the CCP. In the end, they reached a conclusion that the CCP used to be their so-called moneybag, but they now felt the threats from the CCP on everyone’s money, personal safety, interests, future, and families. The incidents of H&M, Nike, and the Xinjiang cotton have made them become clearer about the threats and also know more truths. They have decided to withdraw their capitals from mainland China as soon as possible, including pushing the government to take down the CCP together and find out the truth about the virus.

华尔街的这几个大佬，大家记住，跟他们一起参加了视频会。这老人家说了，我没有想到我们好莱坞开完会，跟他们一个视频几个人，跟我们想法一模一样，比我们还极端。但所有人都说，要给我们一年的时间从共产党那把钱和资产撤出来。

Remember that several big shots in Wall Street joined the conference call with them. This old gentleman said, “What I didn’t expect is that the thoughts of those people who participated in the conference call with our Hollywood folks were identical to ours, and even more extreme than ours.” However, all of them said, “Give us one year to withdraw our money and capital from the CCP’s place.”

这个老人家说：“Miles，你改变了世界，你改变了美国。”我毫不谦虚，我说：“是的，我要告诉你，是我们在改变世界，是我们在帮助美国。美国的垃圾、人渣很多，但美国这个国家的系统，这个国家绝对是伟大的。”他还说这个美国国家对不住你、欠你的、对你不够好。我说：“不是的。”我说，今天我的律师也这么说，我告诉我律师，我说我爱美国，我今天跟你这么说，我还是爱美国，但这块儿人渣很多，就被共产党收买的。

This old gentleman said, “Miles, you have changed the world. You have changed America.” I replied without modesty, “Yes. I am telling you, we are changing the world. It is us that are helping America. There are lots of trash and many scumbags in the U.S. However, the system of the U.S. and the country are absolutely great.” He also said, “America does not treat you well. It owes you because it doesn’t treat you well enough.” I said, “No, my attorney said the same words to me today. I told him that I love America. I am telling the same thing to you today. I am still in love of America. However, there are many scumbags who have been bought off by the CCP.”
