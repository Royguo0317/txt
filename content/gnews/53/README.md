**共产党正在悄悄血洗私营企业**

**The CCP Is Quietly Plundering Private Enterprises in China**

兄弟姐妹们好！3·17，今天3月17号。真快啊。我今天早上我将近7点多才睡觉，我的天啊，但是一觉躺下去，睡的快3小时了，真舒服。

Hello, brothers and sisters! March 17. Today is March 17. Time flies. This morning, I went to bed at almost 7 o’clock. My God. But once I laid down, I slept for almost 3 hours. Feeling so good.

兄弟姐妹们，现在你看到，这共匪真的是疯了，真的是疯了。现在在国内就是抓企业家抓到啥程度？昨天在江苏在浙江，就是两个省，私人企业家最起码抓了三十多个人，所有的都是涉及到所谓的商业诈骗，金融票据诈骗。事实上是什么？没有不诈骗的，要按共产党这个标准，没有不诈骗的。因为共产党就是个流氓黑社会集团，他定的规矩，只要你有钱就是诈骗，除非是他让你，他保护着你，你杀人都没事，他是个流氓规则。那么在这种情况下，中国私人企业家是没好[下场]的，大家你们看到最近在国内所有的商业银行的下场了吗？有好下场吗？

Brothers and sisters, now you can see, these communist bandits are really crazy, really crazy. To what extent are they going after the entrepreneurs in the country? Yesterday, in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, at least 30 private entrepreneurs were arrested. All were accused of being involved in the so-called business fraud, financial instrument fraud. The truth is that there can’t be no fraud because according to the standard of the CCP, no fraud is impossible. Because the CCP is a group of gangsters. They set the rules: if you are rich, you must have committed fraud, unless they allow you and protect you; in that case, you will be fine, even if you killed someone. This is the gangsters’ rule. Under this circumstance, Chinese private entrepreneurs are hopeless.  Have you seen what happened to all the commercial banks in mainland China recently? Is there a good end for any of them?

现在不但在北方、东北、西北、西南、东南、广东，就是悄悄地血洗私营企业，昨天晚上我最起码和五家国内的曾经合作过的地方商业银行，这些股东们通了电话。你看看，我们郑州拥有的中原商业银行，被共产党一个太子党给弄走了，回头再说，回头再告诉大家真相。就这时候还有人图谋与河南裕达拥有郑州中原商银行股份，还有人干这事呐，这共产党是要钱不要命，更不用说要爹了，爹娘都不要，这帮孙子。

Now, not only in the north, northeast, northwest, [but] southwest, southeast, and Guangdong, there is a quiet plunder of private enterprises. Last night, I talked with people who are shareholders of at least five domestic commercial banks that I had worked with before. You see, our Zhongyuan Bank in Zhengzhou was snatched away by one of the CCP’s Princelings. I’ll get back to this later, to tell you all the truth. At this very moment, some people are still plotting to obtain shares of Zhengzhou Zhongyuan Bank with Henan Yuda. These people are still doing that.  These communists would trade their life for money, even trade their father and mother, these bastards.

那么从这一点上你可以看得出来，兄弟姐妹们，我从这几个通话当中，这几个商业银行告诉我说，他说七哥任何一个商银行现在，他说可以这么说，烂帐都超过70%，没有低于70%的。他说为什么我们现在有的还活着，有的不活着？找着老大了，行贿了，我们的后台够硬，就在这活着，继续给钱；没钱给了，或者需要拿你当祭品了，或者说后台不行了，那你就完了。他说现在我们跑步都跑不出去。我才知道就连着商业银行的所谓股东们，还有一个所谓拥有大额贷款的人，在两三年前都被边控了。天哪，这简直真是黑社会党。所以他们说：七哥，我们头两天给你私下开会的时候，你说的几句话太对了，我们跟很多人说，国内，他说，我们圈子的人，我可以告诉你七哥，100%的人都想去投资G系列，他说一个你说的太对了：国内的人不敢，不敢呐，这是一个问题。

Brothers and sisters, you can see things from these phone conversations. Over these phone calls, these several commercial banks told me, “Brother Seven, any commercial banks, right now,” he said, “so to speak, the bad debt rate is over 70%, no less than 70%.”  He continued, “Then, why are some of us still alive now and some others are not? If you can find a big boss and bribe him, whoever has a strong enough background [in the CCP], then you can survive but you have to keep giving him money. Whenever you have no more money to give, or they need to take you as a sacrifice, or the person who backed you loses power, then you are finished.” He said, “Now we can’t escape [China] even if we want to.” Till then, I realized that even the so-called shareholders of commercial banks, and the so-called people with large loans, had been put on the board control list for two or three years. Gosh. This [CCP] is really a gangster party. So they said, “Brother Seven, what you said during our private meeting a couple of days ago is absolutely right, which we’ve told many people within our network. I can tell you Brother Seven, 100% of them want to invest in the G series. What you have said is absolutely right: People in mainland China do not dare to do so. They really don’t. This is a problem.”

他说第一个，90%是不敢，不敢其中也有原因就弄不出去，怕弄着了，是吧？第二个，现在是真没钱哪，弄不出钱去啊，在银行我们取个钱，难着哪七哥，不能，真的是不能。第三个，他说，关于你说那个不信那是你们海外的战友，他说那可能是不信，他说我们这个金融圈里面没有不信的，他说你的事情大家太清楚了，他说现在如果开点口子，他说七哥真不夸张，他说海外十几万亿美元，国内的几万亿美元，他说哪个零头过去，都把你G系列拿钱给你砸垮了。

He said, “Firstly, 90% of them dare not do so. The reason could be that there was no way to wire the money out.” Afraid to be caught, right? He continues, “Second, people really don’t have money or can’t get money out. We can’t withdraw money from banks. So difficult, Brother Seven. We cannot, really cannot.” “Thirdly, you mentioned that people didn’t believe you,” he said, “Probably only overseas folks didn’t believe you. None of our fellow fighters in the financial sector doubted it.” He continued, “Things about you, we all knew it too well.” He said, “If there is an outlet for money to escape, Brother Seven, it wouldn’t be exaggerating to say that even the odd dollars from the ten trillion plus dollars overseas or the trillions of dollars in the mainland would smash your G series.”

我告诉他，我说你知道就过去就70个小时，银行收多少钱吗？昨天是180个，今天早上是2900多个，我说你知道多少钱吗？三个大的金融机构投多少钱吗？大概我跟他们说一下，我跟你们不能说，他们吓一大跳，我说现在没有一股是七哥的，七哥不控股一家公司，你知道我是全球风控名单上，我不可能有任何股份、任何资产。

I said to him, “Do you know just in the last 70 hours, how much money has the bank received?  Yesterday it was 180 [investors who have transferred the money], this morning it was more than 2,900. Do you know how much money has been received in total? Do you know how much money the three big financial institutions have put in?” I told them the answer briefly, but I can’t tell you guys here. They were shocked, and I said not a single share belonged to Brother Seven right now.  Brother Seven doesn’t hold any company because I am on the global risk control list, hence can’t have any shares of any assets.

但是是这个样子，我说：那我请问的是，如果共产党港币完了，香港变死港，变了一个空港的时候，我说你说G系列会是多少钱？或者共产党在台湾开打了，或者共产党要完了，G系列会多少钱？这些搞金融的中国人都太聪明了，大家都去想想，什么概念？

That being said, I asked, “If the CCP’s Hong Kong dollar is over and Hong Kong becomes a dead port, an empty port, how much do you think the G series would be worth? Or if the CCP starts a war against Taiwan, or if the CCP is going to be finished, how much would the G series be worth?” All these Chinese folks in the financial sector are smart people. So let’s think about it, what does it imply?

那么现在我原来要收购的日本的那家虚拟货币交易所第一大的，原来我是2亿快收买了，后来是4亿5，日本的一家 DM 公司，给了他4亿5 ，结果中国的火币来了给了5亿，就涨了整整一半，跟他抢，为什么？共产党非常清楚，下一个数字货币、虚拟经济、网络经济、生物科技、整个太空经济，整个时代到来的时候，谁提前了，谁抢占这个市场了，这种江湖地位，只要你自己形式上不出事，你一定会是没法想象的高度，就像当年诞生了谷歌、Facebook，这样的科技大佬一样。

Initially I wanted to buy the No.1 digital currency exchange company in Japan. My offer of 200 million was almost accepted, then a Japanese DM company came out with an offer of 450 million. Then out came China’s Huobi, which offered 500 million – twice more – to counter their offer. Why? Because the CCP knows it very well that the next era will be about digital currency, virtual economy, internet economy, biotechnology, and the aerospace economy – an entire new era is coming. Whoever is ahead of time and seizes the market will secure their position in the world and be lifted to an unimaginable level, as long as you don’t make big mistakes. It will be like the birth of Google, Facebook and other big tech companies in the old days.

这就是为什么在国内，据他们说，他说我们没有人不看GTV的，他说我们现在有专门就是国内有一堆人，专门下载GTV，给所有内部人发了看的。所以咱们GTV的数值100%不包含国内，你可以在任何第三方，不包含国内的数据的，咱国内数据可以占90%多，对吧？国内是下载观看，这是一个。第二个，咱们有很多GTV的节目太长，人家都是筛选。

That’s why in mainland China, according to them, “We don’t have anyone who doesn’t watch GTV. There are a bunch of people in mainland China who routinely download GTV programs and share them with all the insiders to watch”. So the number of views of our GTV 100% does not include those from mainland China. You can check it through any third party, so it does not include domestic data even though the domestic data can account for more than 90% of the total views, right? First, people in mainland China download it to watch. Second, a lot of our GTV programs are too long, so they are selective in what to watch.

他说特别是在病毒期间，他说GTV的节目，几乎是所有的中国，这也分上中下等了，真的是所有的有点钱的、有点网络、有点能力的、有点权力的，都去看GTV。咱老百姓穷，草根儿没辙，没这个能力，也没这个钱，因为VPN你得翻墙。这就是整个中国现在就像真的是一群待宰的羊，被圈在了一个山坳里面，两边一堵，这在中间，扔两个白菜，扔两个萝卜，是不是？扔点干草你先吃着，然后久不久过来摸摸你的羊毛，是吧？能不能剪哪？是不是？这个可以吃肉了，这个还怀孕了，这个下崽了，是吧？下次杀这个，杀那个，基本是这个结局了。

He said especially during the pandemic, the GTV programs were viewed by all kinds of people in China, of course, there is distinction between the upper, middle and lower class people, but really, all of them went to watch GTV, as long as they had a little money, the access to internet, or a little ability or power. Our Laobaixing or the deplorable are poor, with no means, ability, or money to watch because you need a VPN to break the firewall. This is how the whole of Chinese is like now. They’re like a bunch of sheep waiting to be slaughtered, being penned inside a valley and blocked on both sides, being thrown a couple of cabbages and radishes, and some hay too, for you to eat first.  Then soon someone will come over and rub your wool, right? Can I shear it now, right? This one can be eaten, this one is pregnant, and this one just gave birth, right?  Next time let’s kill this one, or that one. Basically, this is the fate [of the Chinese people].

无论是在经济上，无论是在你的言语，说话的自由能力上，你的行动的空间上，和你对自己财富的支配上，包括你的未来确定上，几乎共产党前所未有地达到了绝对性控制。这个绝对的控制绝不是咱们大家平常所想象的那样，所以在海外的战友真的是幸运吧。

The CCP has reached an unprecedented level of absolute control over the economy, your freedom of speech, your freedom of movement, the distribution of your own wealth, and your future fate. This kind of absolute control is way beyond what we can imagine, so the fellow fighters abroad are really a lucky bunch.

共产党在城市里面，用街道表面上的虚假繁荣，掩盖了共产党现在真正的内部的经济的内部的崩溃。假、大、空，到处撒币，造成的内部的各种的即将迸发的经济癌症，和以及在世界上扩张要征服世界，制造病毒，导致内部的恐惧，都在等待的最后那个靴子掉下来，啥时候能开战？啥时候中南城那个老杂毛能死了？都在等这个结果，全中国上下没有人心是安的，没有人心是对未来有希望，没有任何人觉得明天会比今天更美好。

In the cities, the CCP tries to show the false prosperity in the street but conceals the real collapsing inside the economy. [The CCP’s] “fake, giant, and empty” and throwing cash everywhere, causing all kinds of cancers in its domestic economy that are destined to erupt, expanding to the world in an attempt to conquer everyone, and creating a virus which leads to internal fears have made everyone to wait for the other boot to drop on the floor, wondering when the war will start and when those old bastards in the Zhongnan Pit will die. Everyone is waiting for these to happen. No one feels safe across China; no one feels hopeful for the future; and no one thinks that tomorrow will be better than today.

每个人，昨天晚上我都通了很多电话，我这三部卫星电话都通得其中一个电话都跟我什么了，通话时间过长，几次断掉。兄弟姐妹们，共产党是真完了，彻底完了，整个共产党在带领中国人走向灾难，我们唯一能做的事情：让他少带走些人，少害些人。这也得靠中国的同胞们自己的觉醒。时间到了。

I made a lot of phone calls last night. One of my three satellite phones failed me several times because the call time was too long. Brothers and sisters, the CCP is really over, absolutely over.  The entire Communist Party is leading the Chinese people to disaster. The only thing we can do is to prevent them from taking away or hurting too many of our people. It also relies on our Chinese compatriots themselves to wake up. The time is up.
