2. 官媒把“節約糧食”提到到前所未有的高度，央視痛批“大胃王吃播”類節目。 這是否預示著中國的糧食危機即將來臨？
3. 浙江蕭山試行“工分”制。中國大陸向文革方向倒退。
4. 中國共產黨從世界上隱瞞了它創造的原始病毒遺傳密碼，從而確保西方不會研製出有效的疫苗。 換句話說，中共繼續說謊，人們繼續死亡。
5. 郭文贵：昨天和今天，美國和歐洲的政府包括川普總統在內，正在制定一系列的未來每天的行動方案。像雨一樣的錘子將砸在中共身上。

3. Xiaoshan, Zhejiang Province, began trials of a system in which workers are paid by “Labor Points”.  Mainland China is backing to the Cultural Revolution（happened in China in 1966 – 1976).
4. Steven Mosher：Withholding from the world the original genetic code of  virus that it created, the Chinese Communist Party is ensure that no effective vaccine  be developed by the West. In other words, CCP continues to lie and people continue to die.
5. Miles Guo: Yesterday and today, the American and European governments including President Trump, are making a series day-by-day action plans for the future. Hammers like the rain will crash down on the CCP.
