**摘要：郭先生在2021年4月11日的直播中复述了他在开会的时候给美国人例举的11个他们必须灭共的理由，并透露美国军方已经有数据表明80%美国人要找中共国算账，70%美国人认为美中必有一战。**

**美国的民意已经开启****  ****美国人必须灭共的****11****个理由**

**The Eleven Reasons For the Americans to Take Down the CCP **

美国一旦是民意开启，大家记住我说的话啊，一旦美国民意认为你这个国家你跟我是为敌的、你是我的敌人的时候、竞争对手的时候、你影响我经济利益的时候，就破坏了我的资本主义的精致的利己主义的底线的时候，你和我的意识形态也就是信仰和对人的态度完全相反的时候，再加上能源。

Everyone please remember what I say here. [See what will happen] once the public opinion in the United States is whipped up, and once people believe that your country is my enemy and competitor, and that you touch my economic interests, hurt my bottom line, which is capitalism’s exquisite egoism, and that your and my ideologies are completely opposite to each other in terms of beliefs and attitudes towards the mankind. And what’s more, you’ve touched my energy.

现在又多了什么战友们知道吗？多了一个，你看，能源是国家经济基础，过去的战争都是地理，为了土地，美国人不至于；然后信仰，现在和美国人对着干——它要杀神、杀基督、杀天主、杀穆斯林、杀佛教，跟美国这个信仰是完全是相反的。

My fellow fighters, you know, now there is the energy problem on the top of everything. Energy is the foundation of a country’s economy. In the past, wars were all about geography and land, but that’s not a big problem for Americans. Now, the CCP fights head to head with the Americans on beliefs by killing God, the Christ, the Lord, Muslims, and Buddhists. It’s totally against the belief of Americans.

经济——我偷你的科技、我偷你的技术、我不付你知识产权。什么？大家一看就拉出来了。科技是人类的未来、是国家的安全基石。中共完全偷你的，还不付钱，还威胁你必须给我到中国投资企业。是美国国家未来的威胁吧？

In terms of economy, I [the CCP] steal your technology, and I don’t pay you for intellectual property. What does this mean? You will see that technology is the future of mankind and the cornerstone of national security, but the CCP steals your technology without paying any money and threatens you that you must give me [the CCP] technology if you want to invest in China. Should this be counted as a threat to the future of the US?

第二块，能源——它要抢夺马六甲海峡，包括了吉布提、非洲、中东非。对美国是经济上安全又受影响了吧？——经济。

The second [threat] is energy. It [the CCP] wants to seize the Strait of Malacca, including Djibouti, Africa, and Middle East Africa. Does this impact America’s economic security? So this is economy.

第三条，太空——二战之前没有太空。太空影响了地球安全，美国绝对的安全。现在中共已经在太空上可以随时和美国决一死战，绝对不是美国占多大便宜的问题，肯定最终美国赢，但美国要损失巨大。在损失和死亡、赢的问题上，只要美国有损失，美国就算输了——太空完了吧？

The third [threat] is space. There was no such thing as “space” before World War II. Space affects the security of the earth, and the security of the US, absolutely. Now the CCP can fight the United States to death at any time in space. It is definitely not a question of how much advantage the United States will have over the CCP. America will definitely win in the end, but it will suffer huge losses. As long as the United States has any losses or death, it would mean a loss to the US and space will be over.

第四条，大家看到了，你对整个人类的宗教和信仰已经彻底的干掉，你要当神，你要代替神。

Fourth, everyone has seen that you, CCP, have completely wiped out all religions and beliefs of the entire mankind and you want to be a god, and you want to replace God.

最后，你要看到你破坏我在世界的领导地位。别说什么海陆文明、什么海洋文明，扯淡的事儿。现在你几个，中、俄、朝、伊，现在土耳其也尝了巴基斯坦尝尝欲试了，你这五个邪恶联盟、五个流氓国家，你要对付我。行了，这又出来了吧。

Finally, you want to damage my leadership in the world, then regardless of maritime or land-based, continental civilization, [I will destroy you]. Now a few of you, China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and Turkey (Pakistan also wants to give a try) – the alliance of five evil countries, five rogue countries – want to go against me. Well, here’s it again.

现在又发生了一个最大的俩事，叫什么？——冠状病毒。冠状病毒是什么？最后这个事——种族大屠杀、反人类罪。

Now the two biggest things have happened. What are they called? Coronavirus (tell me what is coronavirus) and genocide – the crime against humanity.

咱把这几天这六条大家去横向地放在这儿的时候，你告诉我美国的民意现在是多少？美国民意现在不是60%，现在的美国军方情报人员：美国超过80%的人要找共产党算账 ，69%到70%的人都认为跟老共要有一战。美国的民意和美国的一切都是要跟着美国的两个核心：意识形态、经济利益。现在又多了这四条：冠状病毒、种族大屠杀、反人类罪。

When the six things are put together, you tell me what the public opinion of the United States is now? It is not 60%, rather, based on the current US military intelligence personnel, over 80% of Americans want to hold the CCP accountable, and 69% to 70% believe that there will be a war with the CCP. The public opinion and everything else in the United States follows the two core things: ideology and economic interests. Now there are four more things: coronavirus, genocide, and crimes against humanity.

我说到这的时候，我给这会上的人说，我说：“你告诉我共产党应不应该灭？共产党会不会被灭？” 我说现在你去看中国的现在这个胡锡进：“我们要把美国打回到农村去，我们要把它打回到石器时代 。”那叫什么张局张召忠，这所有人的讲话跟美国人说“我要把你美国打到农村去，我要用导弹雨把你整个东南亚军事基地全部消灭”。

After I said all these things, I asked the people at this meeting, “Can you tell me whether the CCP should be destroyed? Will the CCP be destroyed?” I said, “Now you should go to watch what Hu Xijin said in China – ‘We ought to defeat Americans and send them back to their farmland. We ought to send them back to the Stone Age.’ Also watch what the guy called Zhang Zhaozhong (a Chinese military theorist at the PLA National Defense University) said. All these people have shouted to the Americans, ‘I want to defeat Americans and send them back to their farmland, and I want to wipe out your entire military base in Southeast Asia with our missile rain.’ ”

然后现在党内人现在把习大神捧成神，说必将收复台湾，必须打台湾。那么，冠状病毒坚决不是我们干的，是美国干的。马六甲、苏伊士运河，一个船接一个船地坏，你将出大问题。

I continued, “And now the party members praised Xi as the great God Xi and said that Taiwan must be regained and Taiwan must be defeated. And, the coronavirus was definitely not made by us, rather it was made by the United States. In Malacca and Suez Canal, you will see ships broken down one after another. Then you will encounter big problems.”

然后美国的社交媒体现代武器和传统媒体，我绝对没人敢说我半个不字，然后美国的三权——国会、白宫、司法领域已经被我控制。这些不是我说的吧，我也编不出来吧。郭文贵是骗子，我能骗，我要是能把这骗出来，我也是成功的骗子了，我也不就是流氓的骗子了，这是不是事实啊？

“On the social media, which is a modern weapon, and traditional media in the United States, no one dare to say any negative thing about me, not even a half negative word. And the three branches of the United States – Congress, the White House, and the judicial system are totally under my control.” I said, “These are not my words. I can’t make them up. I, Miles Guo is a liar, so I can lie, okay, but if I can make up those stuff, I would be a successful liar, and I would not be called a rogue liar anymore. Is this true?”

所以我跟当时开会讨论的人，我说我们用最简单的历史和逻辑回到了希特勒时代。希特勒的当时有几个标志性的事件，最重要的事件，他从跨过莱茵河撕毁当时的一战协议——《凡尔赛协议》，到1935年的3月5号、1936年的3月6号，跨过莱茵河的几十万大军，干掉法国，攻击英国，然后攻打莫斯科。

So I told the people who participated the meeting, “Let’s look at this using the simplest logic and comparing with the history in the Hitler era. Hitler had several iconic events at the time. The most important event was that he crossed the Rhine and tore up the World War I agreement, the “Versailles Agreement”, and from March 5 in 1935 to March 6 in 1936, hundreds of thousands of troops crossed the Rhine, defeated France, attacked Britain, and then attacked Moscow.”

我说：“这些事情跟今天的中共和从中国的开始《中国不高兴》、《中国可以说不》、《到厉害了，我的国》、战狼外交、冠状病毒、影响操控美国大选、干掉香港、撕毁中英协议，现在威胁英国、日本、印度的未来，用整个马六甲海峡要让他们跪下，向中国人说求中国，求中共。”

I said, “On the top of these things, you look at today’s CCP. It started from publishing the books, *Unhappy China*, *China Can Say No*, and *Amazing China*, to the “war wolf” style diplomacy, the coronavirus, manipulating the US election, taking over Hong Kong, tearing up the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and now threatening the future of the United Kingdom, Japan, and India, using the entire Strait of Malacca to make them kneel down and beg the Chinese by saying “Please, I beg you, China, and I beg you, the CCP.”

然后夸张到现在是中国有五亿陆军横扫地球，千架歼-20横扫世界寸草不生，太空中中国可以在几十秒内将太空的所有的全世界布置的卫星武器通通给你拿下；美军基地在三小时内在东南亚全部给你摧毁，核潜艇随时在纽约曼哈顿钻出来把曼哈顿炸平、把美国美东全部给扫空；中共做好了牺牲十亿中国人，中国人死十亿，中国还是第二大人口国。

“And what’s more absurd is that China claimed that it had an army of 500 million soldiers to sweep the entire earth and thousands of J-20 jets so as not to leave a single inch of grass alive in the world; China can shoot down all the satellite weapons deployed by countries all over the world in space within tens of seconds and destroy all the US military bases in Southeast Asia in three hours; its nuclear submarines can emerge in Manhattan at any time to blow up Manhattan and wipe out all East America; and the CCP is ready to sacrifice one billion Chinese people, because even with a billion’s casualty, China would still be the No. 2 most populated country.”

我说这些不是我说的，不是“郭骗子”说的，也不是“郭三秒”说的。还有，还有，我在这儿在今天会上说的话，我说了一共十一条。没有人一个人吱声，我说话没有人吱声，我说完十一条，一个人吱声都没有。

I told them, “None of these things were said by me, nor by Guo Liar or Guo the Three Seconds.” At today’s meeting, after I told them all the eleven reasons, no one uttered a word. No one uttered a word after I spoke, none of them.
