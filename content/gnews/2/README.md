Another testimony has emerged of systematic rape by guards in one of the camps in the West China region of Xinjiang. US news channel CNN spoke with Qelbinur Sidik, a member of the Uzbek minority in China. She gave three months compulsory Chinese to detainees in 2017, when she heard about the rapes from an agent.

Sidik tells how on the first day of her job she saw a lifeless Uyghur woman being carried outside on a stretcher by two soldiers. Later the officer told her that the woman had died of heavy bleeding, without explaining what caused the bleeding. Sidik tells of the first meeting with the men and women she taught: “They came in with handcuffed hands and feet,” said Sidik, who heard her new students cry when she stood with her back to the blackboard. “I saw how their tears fell on their beards, and how the female prisoners were crying out loud.” Young prisoners came in fit and healthy, but soon became ill and weakened during their detention. In a basement classroom where she taught, Sidik could hear people shouting. A male officer is said to have told her that prisoners were tortured there.

**Re-education camps 
**Earlier this month, the British news channel BBC published stories of systematic rape in detention camps. China denies those practices. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there are no detention camps, only re-education centers where minorities can learn a trade and where they are deradicalised. Also, in a number of cases, the interviewees in previous reports are said to be actors and tools in the hands of anti-Chinese forces seeking to bring down China through their coverage of Xinjiang. 

**BBC**
BBC World News has recently been banned in China, including with reference to the coverage of Xinjiang. The US labeled the Chinese treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang in the closing days of the Trump administration as genocide, but that name is controversial.



*Translator’s comments:
People in Xinjiang and other minorities have a long history living in harmony with other nationalities in China, and in particular with the Han nationality. History that goes back way beyond the time when Marco Polo stepped his feet into China through the Silk Road.     When I was a student over 30 years ago, I was always fascinated to hear about my friends’ trips to Xinjiang where people were very hospitable and helpful to them at those good old days.   It is very unfortunate that things have changed so much for the worse ever since the communist government is in power.     First there were issues about Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and now Hong Kong…what’s next? If the Chinese government will do such atrocities to it’s own people, how will they treat foreign people?     Many people in China and foreign governments are blinded by the prosperity that they are benefiting from China’s economic developments and in doing so, they fail to realize the potential danger that the communist government can impose in the future to the rest of the world.    The facts are clearly shown and it’s time to act now for the world community before it’s too late.*
