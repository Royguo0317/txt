**欧洲几个国家被中共蓝金黄对“以毒灭共”是件大好事
CCP’s BGY Plot on European Countries Will Turn Out to Be a Great Thing for the CCP’s Death**

另外，再看这几天，前天我给咱们几个战友，包括英国的咱们特殊的战友说：“一定记住，英国首相一定唱反调。”[现在]英首相唱反调了吧？为啥，战友们知道吗？英国首相不唱反调就说明共产党的蓝金黄力量还不够。而且欧洲会有一两个国家，两三个国家出来[唱反调的]。但是你会发现这些人唱反调最终是对整个全球的“以毒灭共”是大好事，大好事！

In addition, the day before yesterday, I said to some of our fellow fighters, including our special fellow fighter in the United Kingdom: “You must remember that the British Prime Minister will definitely sing a different tune.” Now the British Prime Minister is playing devil’s advocate, right? Why? Do our fellow fighters know? Had the British Prime Minister not sung the opposite tune, that would show that the power of the CCP’s BGY plot was not enough. Likewise, one, two, or three countries in Europe will come out to strike up a discordant tune. But you will find that these people siding with the devil will ultimately be a great thing for the whole world to take down the CCP with the truth of the virus.

而且共产党这些天派杨娘娘去俄罗斯，是吧？包括去德国、法国、英国这一系列的人，拎着几百亿的钱，带着各种的承若和投资项目，包括也带着某些人的“缺点”、证据和录像带、U盘。不行你看看，是吧？银行信息。很多人你们不知道，有些话我不方便说。等有时间我给在家再讲讲。[有些人]很便宜，[买通]没那么难。是大家想的太神乎了。何况这么大的动静呢？

Moreover, recently the CCP has sent Sissy Yang (Yang Jiechi) to Russia and a bunch of people to Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. They brought tens of billions of Euros, various commitments, investment projects, as well as incriminating evidence against certain politicians with them – videotapes and USB flash drives. “If you disagree with us, take a look at these – your bank information. All right?” Many people don’t know, and it is not convenient for me to reveal some things now. I will tell you more when I have time. Some people are very cheap to buy. They are not that difficult to buy off.  It is not as miraculous as everybody thinks. Not to mention that the CCP is making such a big noise.

但是，这个世界上决定这件事输或赢的，就像《欧中协议》被干掉一样，不是说英国、也不是法国和德国，最终还是美国在背后起的力量[决定的]。这个地方[美国]才说了算。

But in this world, the one that decides who wins or loses in this matter, just as how the EU-China Agreement was killed, is not Britain, France, or Germany. Ultimately the United States is the power that decides everything behind the scenes. The United States has the final say.

那么另外一个，大家要看到，更重要的事情[是]经济！在经济面前，各国政客……西方是资本主义社会，也就是钱是爹，钱是主义。在经济面前，很多人都会放弃原则，都要选择利己主义。对自己的任期，对自己的政治的权力，为了这个什么都可以放弃。这就是西方资本主义带来的劣病。

Furthermore, everybody should see that the more important thing is the economy. The West is a capitalist society, where money is God and money is doctrine. In the face of the economy, many people will give up their principles and choose egoism. Most people will give up everything to maintain their position and power. This is the weakness brought about by Western capitalism.

那么经济上，由于共产党所有病毒，以及共产党的假、偷、骗、抢给各国带来的危害，谁要是想走另外一条路，那是找死呢。最重要的，经济等到世界出现滑坡的时候，你会发现共产党大势已去。能挽回吗？大家试试，它一定是[试试]的。[共产党]想现在把人民币坚挺，操纵汇率，甚至不惜代价把中国人的未来都卖给这些利益集团，来换取西方放过对它们这一次截杀的这个可能啊。它[这些]都没用的。

Economically, as a result of the CCP virus and the harm brought to so many countries by the CCP’s fraud, stealing, cheating, and looting, anybody who wants to take another path has a death wish. Most importantly, when the economy is in decline globally, you will find that the tide will turn against the CCP. Can the situation be redeemed? You can try. It [the CCP] will definitely try. It tries to make the Renminbi to stay strong, by manipulating the exchange rate, and even selling the Chinese people’s future to interest groups at any cost, in exchange for the West turning a blind eye to the crimes of the CCP. These are useless efforts.

毫不夸张地说，从一周前基本已经定局共产党就死在病毒上了！死在病毒上就是个时间和方式的问题。促使它死亡的根本就是经济，经济越坏它死得越快，经济如果缓慢滑坡它就死得慢点。但是共产党不会坐以待毙的，它会想尽一切办法，求生欲望很强啊，求生欲望很强。这是可以理解的。

It is no exaggeration to say that it was a foregone conclusion a week ago that the CCP will die because of the virus. It is a matter of time and means. The essential cause of its death is the economy. The worse the economy, the faster it will die. If the economy declines slowly, it will die slowly. But the CCP will not await its doom. It will do everything possible, and its desire to survive is very strong, which is understandable.

从来没有一个帝国在临灭亡前，它认为自己是该灭亡的；从没有一个帝国的国民认为帝国是会灭亡的；也从没有一个帝国在灭亡前真的以为自己会全部消失的。没有，从来没有过！历史上几千年来告诉人类，这个时候到那个时候已经失去理智了。可是大势总是不可逆转的，自然现象[规律]谁也逆转不了。

There has never been an empire that considered the possibility that it would be destroyed before it was. No citizens of an empire consider that the empire might perish. And no empire has really considered that it will crumble before it does. This has never happened. Never. Thousands of years of human history has proved that people usually lose their minds at that kind of moment. But the historical trend is always irreversible, and no one can reverse the laws of the nature.
