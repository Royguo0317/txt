## 美国针对中共在做战争前的全面布局?

**摘要：郭先生在2021年5月12日的盖特视频中，以美国在伊拉克战争前的准备为例，透露出美国现在针对中共国，正在做战争前全面布局。这包括：企业从中共国撤资；将生产链挪至东南亚；把新加坡、日本变成亚洲金融中心替代香港；通过在印度周围的几个岛、巴基斯坦和印度的交界处、孟加拉以及泰国南部布置重兵器，来彻底控制石油通道。对比看中共，他们永远都不在乎士兵和人民的死活，只想保住自己的私生子女和财富。**

**美国针对中共在做战争前的全面布局****?**

**What Is the US Preparing Surrounding Communist China?**

同时大家看到现在美国在干什么？「当年」伊拉克战争前夕，当时整个中东都不相信美国会打伊拉克，甚至到开战的时候还有国家「认为」美国打伊拉克会迅速撤出，马上就会撤出，打几下就走人。当时最前「线」反映就两件事儿：「第一是」大量的在周围布兵；第二件事，「在伊拉克」周围，在中东国家「的」美国驻中东商会以及大型企业撤走。

Have you noticed what the US is preparing? Just before the Iraq War, the entire Middle East did not believe that the US would go to a war against Iraq. Even after the war had started, some countries still thought the US would withdraw quickly and it was going to be a short war. Two things happened at that time. The first thing was that the US had deployed a large number of troops around there in advance. The second thing was that the US Chamber of Commerce in the Middle East, and large companies, had evacuated from other Middle Eastern countries around Iraq before the war started.

现在看到的是美国的所有的商会正在香港，在中共国，以及周围地「区」包括澳门，甚至一些敏感的东西啊都要赶快撤出去。这就是现在整个中共的现状。兄弟姐妹你们「要」看到，过去这两周从中共国撤出来的企业「都是」实质性对中共国「曾有」致命帮助「的」，都是离了人家「这些企业，共产党」就不能活的。这些「企业」都在干什么？撤人、撤钱、撤技术。

Now, we can see that the US Chamber of Commerce is evacuating from Hong Kong, mainland China, and the surrounding areas, including Macau. Even sensitive operations are being withdrawn immediately. That’s what the CCP is confronting right now. Brothers and sisters, you need to understand that the companies that have withdrawn in the past two weeks have been substantial and crucial contributors to the CCP for a long time. But now they are leaving one-by-one. The CCP cannot survive without these companies. What are these companies doing? They are evacuating people, withdrawing capital, and withdrawing their technology.

另外，除了美国「在」大量的撤资，撤出技术，商业撤出之外，美国的企业在干什么？美国的企业做了大量的布局「以」代替「原来在」中共的所有生产链。

In addition, what are the US companies doing besides the massive withdrawal of their capital, technology, and commercial projects? They are making as many preparations as possible to replace the production chain previously invested in mainland China.

中共国大量的劳工被剥削的“打工仔，打工妹”都衰老，失去劳动力，一亿多人失业的情况下，那么在越南、缅甸、孟加拉、印度、泰国、马来西亚周围，大量的在布置更多的美国的生产型企业。甚至把「一些」产业「搬到」了东欧去了。「共产党」这一下就完了，「它」所有维护的就是榨取这些打工妹、打工仔「的剩余价值」。生产线一移出，中国所有的60%～70%所谓的人口红利 — 就是便宜的劳动力「所」生产的便宜产品，终端产品。这个没了「共产党能」有什么外汇？周围国家都是敌对国，对不对？那你说这不是噩梦吗？

The CCP is losing the advantage of its labor force – the cheap labor force called “working young boy and working young girl” is being lost because they are aging and losing their ability of working. More than 100 million people will lose their jobs. The US is setting up more productive enterprises in countries surrounding the CCP, such as Vietnam, Burma, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, and Malaysia. Some industries have relocated to Eastern Europe. In that case, the CCP will decline rapidly. What the CCP relies on is to extract the surplus value of this cheap labor force. Once the production lines move out of China, 60% to 70% of the profits that the CCP siphons from its large population will be cut off – the low-priced, low-end products, produced by this cheap labor forces. Without this, how can the CCP gain foreign exchange? In addition, all the neighboring countries have become hostile countries. You can tell me if this is a nightmare for the CCP.

同时看到金融这一块儿，在两三个月以前美国没打算把新加坡、日本变成金融中心，「现在」美国是真正的在严肃认真地把新加坡「和」日本变成美国在亚洲的金融中心。

Regarding the financial sector, two or three months ago, the US had no intention of making Singapore and Japan financial centers. But the US is seriously considering it now.

更夸张的，对中共极为不利的，最危险的信息，竟然现在在印度周围的几个军事岛上马上要布置重兵器 — 大家看着啊，「这个现在」没有人说出来– 马上在印度的在马六甲海峡，在整个巴基斯坦和印度的交界处，包括在孟加拉以及泰国南部将布置重兵武器。一下就把共产党所有「在」亚洲的触手，争了那么多年的马六甲海峡彻底控制起来了。也就是石油通道「彻底控制起来了」。

An even more incredible development, also highly unfavorable to the CCP, is that the US has decided to deploy heavy weapons on several militarized islands around India. We will see. Nobody but your Brother Miles has yet disclosed this – the US will soon deploy heavy weapons inside India, in the Strait of Malacca, on the border of Pakistan and India, including in Bangladesh, and in southern Thailand. Then, it will tie up all the “tentacles” that CCP has extended in Asia over the years. The Strait of Malacca, which many countries have contested for years, will also be entirely controlled by the US – that is, the US will completely control the oil transportation routes.

在这种情况下，兄弟姐妹们，「大家要」想到美国这些战略，这些决定和这些动作绝对不是说跟你共产党打个持久战，是吧？遏制你发展？不存在这个问题。「美国」现在把自己国内一旦跟老共发生问题以后，在国内的经济尽量保持稳定，企业减少损失，不像共产党似的，一有事先抓私人企业家，干掉私人企业家，「美国」不是的。

In this case, brothers and sisters, you must realize that these US strategies and these decisions and actions are definitely not for a long-term war against the CCP, or merely intend to restrict the CCP’s expansion? Not at all. The US is now preparing to keep its domestic economy as stable as possible and minimize business losses once a conflict with the CCP has occurred. Unlike what the CCP always does – arrest the private entrepreneurs and rob their property. The US will never be like that.

另外，老美这套思路，「在」任何情况下都要保证美国的军队，整个的后勤的供给。还有在某几个地区同时做好能打两场战争的准备。更重要的事情，世界的供应链不能断。能源供应链「和」贸易供应链「都」不能断。

The US strategy is to secure the military, and the entire logistical supply, under any circumstances. It wants to be prepared to handle two wars at the same time in different regions. More importantly, the world supply chain cannot be interrupted, neither the energy supply chain, nor the trade supply chain.

所以「美国」整个布局和共产党「只」保证中南坑几个老杂毛，「只保证」它们的私生子女不被抓，老百姓死越多越好，最好杀到「美国和西方」手软，「杀到」不敢杀，血流满地吓得「对方」不敢杀了，反正杀不到「他们自己」，杀到他们难着呢，「他们」是这就是这概念。跟当年萨达姆是一个德行。

So US readiness is much superior to the CCP’s approach of only protecting a few old bastards and their families in the Zhongnan pit. The CCP only cares about assuring their illegitimate children don’t get caught. As for the ordinary people, the more death, the better. If the CCP starts a war, they will try to terrify the US and the West by allowing them to kill masses of Chinese civilians, allowing their blood to flow in rivers until they become sick of killing, hoping that this will embarrass them into ending the war. This is what the CCP is thinking. They are as evil as Saddam back then.

在这种情况下，整个美国的布局从马六甲海峡「开始」，当我知道在印度南部、印度东南部，巴基斯坦和印度交界处，在泰国，在马来西亚，在孟加拉「准备」布置重兵的时候，马六甲海峡，整个霍尔木兹海峡，以及到埃及运河这一块儿美国只要是全面开始封锁。

You can see now that the whole US strategy starts from the Straits of Malacca. When I learned the US would deploy heavy forces in southern India, southeast India, on the border of Pakistan and India, in Thailand, Malaysia, and Bangladesh, I realized once the war started, the US would lockdown the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Hormuz, to the canal in Egypt.

那「如果和」共产党打仗，你封台湾，我封你马六甲海峡，是不是？日本的油船「能」过，中共国「的」不能过。「共产党」你不就完球蛋了吗？你生产的什么东西也卖不出来。最重要的是这些技术再「不会」输出「到」中国，国内大型设备，大型的所有的高科技设备用的芯片，「和」用的机床设施，几乎100%全靠国外的。技术封杀，设备「封杀」，「共产党会」比伊朗还要惨，因为伊朗没有使用那么多高科技设备。你中共国使用那么多，「离开了这些」运作不下去了。

If there is a war against the CCP, and the CCP blockades Taiwan, the US will block the Straits of Malacca. The Japanese oil carriers could pass but not the CCP’s. Wouldn’t the CCP be finished then? In addition, no products that the CCP manufactured could be shipped out. Most importantly, if the war started, there would be no technology provided to China. Its large-scale domestic equipment, all chips used in large, high-tech equipment, and high-tech machine devices, are almost 100% reliant on Western technology. Once the CCP encountered technology blockage and equipment blockage, it would become even worse off than Iran. Iran never uses that much high-tech equipment, but the CCP uses it so widely. Without these devices, how can you (the CCP) survive?
