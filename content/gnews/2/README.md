Despite “Positive News” On Vaccine Front, The Outlook Remains “Extremely Uncertain” Powell Tells Congress In Prepared Remarks

鲍威尔告诫国会“尽管疫苗的好消息不断，但前景仍然极不确定”

In what was largely a repeat of his Nov 12 comments to a panel hosted by the ECB, Fed Chair Powell warned lawmakers that the US economy remains in a damaged and uncertain state, despite progress made in the development of Covid-19 vaccines, urging them once again to release much needed fiscal stimulus.

美联储主席鲍威尔重申在11月12日对欧洲央行主持小组会议的评论，他警告议员们，尽管Covid-19疫苗的开发取得了进展，但美国经济仍处于受损和不确定的状态，督促他们再次批准急需的财政刺激措施。

“Recent news on the vaccine front is very positive for the medium term,” Powell said in [prepared testimony](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20201201a.htm)released Monday ahead of a Tuesday hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, although in order not to overplay the optimism – since that may shut down hopes for any new stimulus bill, he said that “significant challenges and uncertainties remain, including timing, production and distribution, and efficacy across different groups.”

鲍威尔在参议院银行委员会周二举行的听证会前一天发布的准备证词中表示，“近期疫苗方面的消息对中期而言是非常积极的，尽管这样做不是为了夸大乐观情绪，因为这可能会断绝对新刺激方案的希望。仍然存在重大挑战和不确定因素，包括时间，生产和分配以及不同群体的疗效。”

As a result, “**the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend, in large part, on the success of efforts to keep the virus in check.”**

因此，“经济前景非常不确定，并在很大程度上将取决于控制病毒的努力是否成功。

And while economic activity “has continued to recover from its depressed second-quarter level” in recent months **“the pace of improvement has moderated” **Powell said, in what is a preamble for the latest request for a few trillion in fiscal stimulus funds, which the Fed promises to quickly monetize. Whether or not Congress agrees to release the funds will likely depend on the outcome of the Georgia’s runoff elections in January, which will decide the composition of the Senate.

鲍威尔在最近要求数万亿美元财政刺激资金，且美联储承诺将迅速货币化的前提下表示，“尽管近几个月来经济活动从第二季度的低迷状态继续复苏，但改善的步伐有所放缓。国会是否同意释放这笔资金很可能取决于一月份佐治亚州大选的结果，这将决定参议院的组成”。

Tomorrow’s hearing will be the first appearance of Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin together since they disagreed over the expiration of several emergency loan programs set up after the pandemic hit in March.

明天的听证会将是鲍威尔和财政部长史蒂芬·姆努钦自3月份疫情袭击后他们在设立的几个紧急贷款计划到期存在分歧以来的首次共同露面。

Commenting on the Fed’s “13(3)” emergency facilities, Powell said that these programs “serve as a backstop to key credit markets and have helped restore the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels. We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent. Our emergency lending powers require the approval of the Treasury and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today. Many of these programs have been supported by funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).”

鲍威尔在评论美联储的“ 13（3）”紧急措施时说，这些计划“充当了关键信贷市场的支撑，并帮助恢复通过正常渠道来自私人贷方的信贷流。我们已将这些借贷权以前所未有的程度部署。我们的紧急贷款权力需要获得财政部的批准，并且仅在非同寻常的情况下才可用，例如我们今天所遇到的情况。其中许多计划得到了冠状病毒援助，救济和经济安全法（CARES Act）的资助。

Powell also said that the Fed’s Main Street Lending Program – while not widely used currently – “offers a credit backstop for firms that do not currently need funding but may if the pandemic continues to erode their financial condition.”

鲍威尔还提到美联储的“主街借贷计划”，虽目前未得到广泛使用，“仍会为目前不需要资金但可能被疫情持续恶化财务状况的公司提供信贷支持”。

That said, Powell admitted that the CARES Act assigns sole authority over its funds to Mnuchin, writing that “the Secretary has indicated that these limits do not permit the CARES Act-funded facilities to make new loans or purchase new assets after December 31 of this year. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve will return the unused portion of funds allocated to the lending programs that are backstopped by the CARES Act in connection with their termination at the end of this year. As the Secretary noted in his letter, non-CARES Act funds in the Exchange Stabilization Fund are available to support emergency lending facilities if they are needed.”

话虽如此，鲍威尔承认CARES Act将其资金拥有唯一的权力交给了姆努钦，并写道：“部长已指出，这些限制不允许CARES Act资助的机构在2020年的12月31日之后发放新贷款或购买新资产。因此，美联储将归还分配给贷款计划的未使用的资金，这些贷款计划由CARES Act支持并于今年年底终止。正如部长在信中指出的那样，如果需要，可使用外汇稳定基金中的非CARES Act资金来支持紧急贷款机构。

In his own set of [prepared remarks](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1196), Mnuchin said that he continues to believe “that a targeted fiscal package is the most appropriate federal response” and he strongly encourages Congress “**to use the $455 billion in unused funds from the CARES Act to pass an additional bill with bipartisan support” **adding that the Administration is standing ready to support Congress in this effort to help American workers and small businesses that continue to struggle with the impact of COVID-19.

姆努钦在一系列准备发言中说，他继续相信“有针对性的财政计划是最合适的联邦对策”，并且他强烈鼓励国会“利用《 CARES Act》中的4,550亿美元未动用资金来通过额外的两党支持法案”，并补充说，美国政府已准备好支持国会，以帮助美国工人和小型企业继续抵抗中共的影响。

Mnuchin announced earlier this month that those Fed programs must sunset at the end of December, and asked the central bank to return unused funding authorized for the programs by Congress. The Treasury also said it plans to move that unspent money into its general account, over which Congress has authority.

姆努钦在本月早些时候宣布，这些联储计划必须在12月底终止，并要求央行退还国会授权用于该计划的未使用资金。财政部还表示，计划将未动用的资金转入国会批准的普通帐户

笔者观点：

中共病毒在全球的大面积传播和持续感染，已经重创美国经济。现在美国经济的回暖只是建立在政府大规模经济刺激、美联储大量超发货币和疫苗假消息的基础上，犹如无根之木。

此轮的经济刺激和超发货币只会导致资本市场的泡沫更加巨大化和美元信用崩溃。闫丽梦博士早已警告美国政府和民众，不消灭中国共产党，不可能制造出有效的中共病毒疫苗。

现在任何经济措施只能延缓经济危机的脚步，因为中共仍在持续散播和制造病毒。如果不能短期内消灭中共，拿到病毒的关键毒株和相关数据，等待美国和世界的恐怕是比20世纪30年代大萧条更恐怖的未来。
