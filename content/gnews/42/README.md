## 致留学生
` TINALS` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/682273/)

在2020年12月22日的盖特视频中，郭文贵先生说读了《中国的留学生在海外》，作者姓李。现在有六十万留学生，多少人被拒绝，甚至被撵回国去。郭先生以前说过，海外的小粉红们，他们得害死多少人啊！全世界的文明国家都在驱逐、拒绝中国留学生。郭先生刚刚和某国的一位可能会是下一任总理的人物谈话。对方说，他们国家在未来的一定时间内会逐渐限制中国人到这个国家去，而且最近就要公布，把对中国人的签证，可能要像过去对待阿富汗一样，列入最危险的国家。那么去就很难了，基本和到月球上差不多了。

My dear brothers and sisters, it’s now December 22nd, time really flies! A while ago, I’ve been chatting with brothers and sisters in the group chat, and I also had several small virtual meetings. I just sent a Getter, my dear brothers and sister, I ask everyone to read it carefully. I don’t know which goofy head whose surname is Li and seems to be a scholar within the Chinese government, could be an economist, or maybe a sociologist, whose surname is Li. He wrote an article entitled “Chinese Overseas Students Living Abroad.” There are now 600,000 overseas students, and how many of them have been rejected by visa, or even been sent back to China. When did Miles make the comment about those overseas young supporters of the CCP? How many death they would have caused! Brothers and sisters, think about it how many death they would cause! By now, all the civilized countries in the world are expelling and rejecting Chinese overseas students. So when I saw this report, I wanted to share it with everyone. In fact, I mentioned one or two years ago that the CCP being a hooligan had destroyed all the possibilities for the Chinese to have a better life. And yet, these young supporters, these bastards, they are simply bringing their own destruction!

尊敬的战友们好！这都十二月二十二号了，真快呀！真快呀！刚才一直和战友们——我们的群里边一直在说话，同时开了几个小视频会议。刚刚我发了一个盖特，亲爱的兄弟姐妹们，我拜托战友们，你们要好好看一看。我也不知道是哪位大仙儿，姓李，看来是体制内的一位学者，一个经济学者，也可能是社会学家，姓李，写的《中国的留学生在海外》。现在是六十万留学生，多少人被拒绝，甚至给撵回国去。文贵什么时候给大家说的？海外的小粉红们，他得害死多少人啊！兄弟姐妹们，他得害死多少人啊！这全世界的文明国家都在驱逐、拒绝中国留学生。我看了这个报道，我想发给大家。七哥实际上在一年前、两年前就说过：共产党这个流氓啊，它把所有中国人的有可能过好日子的机会全给弄没了！而且这帮小粉红，这帮王八蛋，就是往死里整啊！

Just a while ago – do you still remember what I said before? You always don’t understand what I said, right? Just a while ago, I met with someone from a certain country, who could be the next vice prime minister. I think he is somebody who could be qualified to be a prime minister. So I asked him: “What is your opinion about Chinese overseas students?” He said, “This is something that nobody can change now, and for a certain period of time in our country in the future, even if the CCP would still be there, ” He is of course not so determined to destroy the CCP as we are still communicating with him, and he said, “As far as the Chinese admission in that country, it will be gradually restricted. And very soon they are going to announce that they will apply the same visa principle for Afghanistan to Chinese, and will list China as the most dangerous country.” Then it will be very difficult for you to come over, basically as difficult as going to the moon! And then he said, “The New Federal State of China has made it, and has become the hope of the world, not just the hope of the Chinese!”

刚刚——过去七哥说啥，你们老听不明白，是吧？刚刚，我和某国的一位副总理吧——下一次的，我觉得他可能是会当总理的人物（谈话），我问他：“你们下一步对中国的留学生有什么看法？”他说：“这是没有任何人可以改变的，我们国家在未来的一定时间内，就是共产党如果还在的话，”他当然没那么坚定地灭共了，现在还跟我们在沟通当中，“中国人到这个国家去，会逐渐限制，而且最近就要公布，把对中国人的签证，可能要像过去对待阿富汗一样，列入最危险的国家。那你来就很难了，基本和到月球上差不多了！”然后他说：“你们新中国联邦，如果真做到了，那就是世界的希望，不只是中国人的希望了！”
