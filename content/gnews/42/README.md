## I. Introduction 

## 引言

At the stroke of midnight on Election Day, President Donald J. Trump appeared well on his way to winning a second term. He was already a lock to win both Florida and Ohio; and no Republican has ever won a presidential election without winning Ohio while only two Democrats have won the presidency without winning Florida.

在选举日午夜钟声敲响的时候，看起来总统唐纳德·J ·川普赢得第二任期的进展非常顺利。他已经赢得了了弗罗里达州和俄亥俄州的胜利；而且从来没有一位共和党人赢得了总统选举而没有赢得俄亥俄州，而只有两位民主党人没有赢得弗罗里达州情况下赢得了总统职位。

At the same time, the Trump-Pence ticket had substantial and seemingly insurmountable leads in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. If these leads held, these four key battleground states would propel President Trump to a decisive 294 to 244 victory in the Electoral College.

同时，川普和彭斯的选票一直很稳定并且在佐治亚州、宾夕法尼亚州、密西根州和威斯康星州看似具有不可逾越的领先优势。如果保持住这种领先优势，这四个关键的战场州将推动川普总统在选举人团中获得294票对244票的决定性的胜利。

Shortly after midnight, however, as a flood of mail-in and absentee ballots began entering the count, the Trump red tide of victory began turning Joe Biden blue. As these mail-in and absentee ballots were tabulated, the President’s large leads in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin simply vanished into thin Biden leads.

然而午夜后不久，当大量的邮寄选票和缺席选票开始计入点票，川普获胜的红色浪潮开始变成了拜登蓝。随着这些邮寄选票和缺席选票被统计，总统在佐治亚州、宾夕法尼亚州、密西根州和威斯康星州的大幅领先完全消失而变成了拜登的微弱领先优势。

At midnight on the evening of November 3, and as illustrated in Table 1, President Trump was ahead by more than 110,000 votes in Wisconsin and more than 290,000 votes in Michigan. In Georgia, his lead was a whopping 356,945; and he led in Pennsylvania by more than half a million votes. By December 7, however, these wide Trump leads would turn into razor thin Biden leads –11,779 votes in Georgia, 20,682 votes in Wisconsin, 81,660 votes in Pennsylvania, and 154,188 votes in Michigan.

在11月3日的半夜，就像表1所示，川普总统在威斯康星州领先110，000多张选票，密歇根州领先290，000多张选票。在乔治亚州，更是大幅领先356，945张选票；并且在宾夕法尼亚州领先50多万张选票。然而到12月7日，川普的大幅领先优势变成了拜登的微弱优势。拜登在乔治亚州领先11，779票，威斯康星州领先20，682票，宾夕法尼亚州领先81，660票和密歇根州154，188票。

表1:川普红色浪潮变成拜登蓝

表中文字：

行：佐治亚，宾夕法尼亚，密西根，威斯康星

列：11/3 午夜 川普领先，12/15 拜登“领先”

There was an equally interesting story unfolding in Arizona and Nevada. While Joe Biden was ahead in these two additional battleground states on election night – by just over 30,000 votes in Nevada and less than 150,000 votes in Arizona – internal Trump Campaign polls predicted the President would close these gaps once all the votes were counted. Of course, this never happened.

在亚利桑那州和内华达州逐渐呈现着一件同样有趣的事情。选举之夜当乔·拜登在这两个战场州领先的时候—在内华达州仅以30，000多张票领先，在亚利桑那州不到150，000张票领先—内部川普竞选民意调查预测一旦所有的选票统计完毕，川普总统将缩小这些差距。当然，这一切从未发生。

In the wake of this astonishing reversal of Trump fortune, a national firestorm has erupted over the fairness and integrity of one of the most sacrosanct institutions in America – our presidential election system. Critics on the Right and within the Republican Party – including President Trump himself – have charged that the election was stolen. They have backed up these damning charges with more than 50 lawsuits, 4 thousands of supporting affidavits and declarations, and seemingly incriminating videos, photos, and first-hand accounts of all manner of chicanery.

紧随川普命运惊心动魄的大反转，在全国爆发了一场针对我们的总统选举制度—美利坚最神圣不可侵犯的体系之一的公正性和完整性的质疑风暴。右冀和共和党内部的批评人士—包括川普总统本人—指控大选结果被窃取。他们通过50多起法律诉讼，4千份宣誓书和声明，看似有罪的视频和照片，以及各种欺诈行为的第一手资料来支持这些确凿指控。

Critics on the Left and within the Democrat Party have, on the other hand, dismissed these charges as the sour grapes of a whining loser. Some of these critics have completely denied any fraud, misconduct or malfeasance altogether. Others have acknowledged that while some election irregularities may have existed, they strenuously insist that these irregularities are not significant enough to overturn the election.

另一方面，左派和和民主党内部的批评人士否认这些指控，将其说成是失败者的酸葡萄式的抱怨。其中一些批评者则干脆完全否认有任何欺诈、处理不当或渎职行为。另外一些人则承认尽管可能存在一些选举违规行为，但同时又极力坚持这些违规行为没有严重到改变选举结果的地步。

There is a similar Battle Royale raging between large anti-Trump segments of the so-called “mainstream” media and alternative conservative news outlets. Across the anti-Trump mainstream media diaspora – which includes most prominently print publications like the New York Times and Washington Post and cable TV networks like CNN and MSNBC – a loud chorus of voices has been demanding that President Trump concede the election.

在所谓的主流媒体反川普阵营和另一类保守派新闻媒体之间也爆发了类似的激烈大战。众多的反川普主流媒体，其中包括像纽约时报和华盛顿邮报这样最著名的印刷出版物以及CNN和MSNBC这样的有线电视网络，齐声高喊要求川普总统退出选举。

These same anti-Trump voices have been equally quick to denounce or discredit anyone –especially anyone within their own circle – that dares to investigate what may well turn out to be THE biggest political scandal in American history. Social media outlets like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube likewise have been actively and relentlessly censoring anyone who dares to call the results of the election into question.

这些反川普的声音同样会迅速地谴责和诋毁任何人—特别是他们自己圈子里的任何人—任何敢于调查这个很可能是美国历史上最大的政治丑闻的人。社交媒体像脸书、推特和油管同样积极不懈地审查任何敢于质疑大选结果的人。

In contrast, alternative news outlets, primarily associated with the American conservative movement, have provided extensive, in-depth coverage of the many issues of fraud, misconduct, and other irregularities that are coming to light. From Steve Bannon’s War Room Pandemic  and  John Solomon’s Just the News  to Raheem Kassam’s National Pulse,  to Newsmax, and One America News Network, Americans hungry for facts and breaking developments have been able to find such critical information only by following this alternative coverage.

相反，另一类的新闻媒体，主要是与美国保守派运动有关的媒体，广泛而深刻地报道了正在被曝光的有关欺诈、处理不当和其他违规行为的众多问题。从史蒂夫·班农（Steve Bannon）的疫情作战室和约翰·所罗门（John Solomon）的只是新闻，到拉希姆·卡萨姆（Raheem Kassam）的国家脉动，还有Newsmax，和美国壹新闻网，渴求事实和突破性进展的美国人只有关注这种另类报道才能够找到如此重要的信息。

That the American public is not buying what the Democrat Party and the anti-Trump media and social media are selling is evident in public opinion polls. For example, according to a recent Rasmussen poll: “Sixty-two percent (62%) of Republicans say it is ‘Very Likely the Democrats stole the election’” while 28% of Independents and 17% of Democrats share that view.

民意调查表明美国公众明显不买民主党、反川普媒体和社交媒体的帐。例如，最近一次拉斯穆森民意调查表明： 62%的共和党人认为很可能是民主党人窃取了大选，而28%的独立派和17%的民主党人持相同观点。

If, in fact, compelling evidence comes to light proving the election was indeed stolen after *a fait accompli* Biden inauguration, we as a country run the very real risk that the very center of our great American union will not hold.

假如在拜登就职成为既成事实后，令人信服的证据浮出水面，证明大选确实被窃取了，事实上作为一个国家我们冒着非常真实的危险，那就是我们伟大美国联盟的核心将无法为继。

To put this another way, if the greatest democracy in world history cannot conduct a free and fair election, and if much of the mainstream media of this country won’t even fully investigate what is becoming a growing mountain of evidence calling into question the election result, there is little chance that our democracy and this Republic will survive as we know it. It is therefore critical that we get to the bottom of this matter. That is the purpose of this report.

换种说法，如果世界历史上最伟大的民主国家不能举行一场自由公正的大选，如果这个国家的大多数主流媒体甚至不会完全调查越来越多的对大选结果提出质疑的证据，正如我们所知道的那样，我们的民主和共和国幸存下来的机会非常渺茫。因此弄清这一事件的真相是很关键的。这就是这份报告的目的所在。
