**简述：郭先生在****2021****年****4****月****8****日的盖特视频中解读美国解除对伊朗制裁的效应，他说伊朗制裁的解除将使中东重新陷入战争，将对中共不利，而这种竞争的最后还是新中国联邦受益；美国拜登政府已经达成共识，在病毒一事上不会放过中共；中共在霍尔木兹海峡和苏伊士运河四处出击，就像二战当年的日本军国主义攻击珍珠港，不会有好下场。**

**美国解除对伊朗制裁将给中东、中共、美国和新中国联邦带来的影响**

**Miles Interprets the Implications of U.S. Lifting Sanctions on Iran**

接着现在说这几天大家现在已经看到了伊朗的这个事情，所谓的美国没有制裁了。对咱是好事儿。伊朗没制裁了，伊朗一放开了，伊朗就有可能和老共不一定站在一起[了]。[和]老共不站在一起[了]，伊朗的中东，伊朗的中东就会发生[大事儿]。

Let me continue. In the past few days, everyone has seen this news about Iran, that is the U.S. is preparing to lift sanctions on Iran. It will be good for us. If sanctions on Iran are lifted and Iran is open up, it will probably stop siding with the CCP. If Iran doesn’t stand with the CCP, Iran and the Middle East will see big things happening.

伊朗是三驾马车，伊朗一直想当老大，第二是伊拉克，这才为什么发生了两伊战争，第三是沙特，这三驾马车要开干。实际[是]三驾火车，老要撞。他仨一撞都要抢着和共产党好，同时也抢着和老美好，中东战火重起开始！这种竞争的背后最后还是新中国联邦得利。

Iran is one of the horses of a troika in the Middle East, and Iran has always wanted to be the boss. The second one is Iraq, that is why there was the Iran-Iraq War. The third one is Saudi Arabia. The three “horses” are going to fight with each other. Actually the three “trains” are always colliding with each other. Once the three collide with each other, they will compete to have a good relationship with the CCP, and at the same time, they will also want to be good with the U.S., then the war in the Middle East will start again! Behind this competition, of course, the New Federal State of China (NFSC) will be the beneficiary in the end.

[虽然]咱不想让他们战争，但是他们的斗争对我们新中国联邦来讲，咱们是机会。告诉我，这三个国家哪一个愿意与新中国联邦为敌？永远不会。这就是我们的机会。对老美来讲不是好事儿，对老共来讲也不是好事儿，但是对咱们来讲是好事儿，因为毕竟伊朗是穆斯林。真正的伊朗的所谓没制裁是因为奥巴马总统的穆斯林的宗教信仰还有和拜登之间政治的这个整个利益。但对新中国联邦是好事。

Although we don’t want them to fight, but their fighting will present an opportunity for our NFSC. You tell me, which of these three countries will want to make an enemy with the NFSC? They will never do that. This will be our opportunity. It’s not going to be a good thing to the U.S., nor to the CCP, but it’s a good thing for us, because after all, Iran is a Muslim country. The real reason for lifting Iran’s sanctions is due to President Obama’s Muslim religious belief and the entire political interests of Biden. But it is a good thing for the NFSC.

但另外一个，[大家]反而[应该]看到：[美国]放过伊朗，[但]绝不会放过共产党！ 所以大家你们看到了：对共的所谓病毒的严查，[我]听说啊，做梦听说的，听说这一点拜登政府已经达成共识。这一点上必须不能妥协，因为妥协就[等于拜登]自己被赶出白宫，就完球蛋了，是吧？[所以]这个不会妥协。那对咱是好事儿，是吧？那对咱是好事儿。

But on the other hand, everyone should see that the U.S. is willing to let Iran get away, but it will never let the CCP get away! So you guys have seen that the serious investigation of the CCP virus, based on what I heard, I mean, dreamed, is a consensus in the Biden administration. There must be no compromise on this point, because if Biden compromises, he will be kicked out of the White House and be done for, right? So there will not be any compromise on this. That will be good for us, right? Will be good for us.

还有一个，在明年2022的中期选举，民主党要想赢和共和党想赢[都]只有一个主题：灭共！查病毒真相，“以毒灭共”。只要以毒能灭共，咱管球啥那干啥的？爱咋的咋的，是吧？ 还有个咱“以钱灭共”，“以钱灭共”谁也挡不着咱，是吧？

or the Republicans want to win, they will have only one theme: taking down the CCP! Find out the truth about the virus and then take down the CCP with the truth about the virus. As long as they use the truth about the virus to take down the CCP, what else do we care about? We won’t care, right? There is also the “taking down the CCP with money [financial activities]”, and no one can stop us from taking down the CCP with money, right?

现在美国经济、美元、黄金，大家看了黄金了吗？大家看到黄金了吗？看到大宗贸易了吗？看着现在7哥刚说完，我说苏伊士运河，霍尔木兹海峡还得出事儿。美国这些投资者说，“老郭，不可能。”我说“不可能？你等着！”[结果]“啪”第二个，七哥刚说完 24 小时又出事了。

Now the U.S. economy, the U.S. dollars, and gold … have you seen the gold price? Have you seen major commodities trading? Have you seen that, right after your Brother Miles said Suez Canal and the Strait of Hormuz were going to have some trouble, “BANG”, within 24 hours, it happened. Some American investors first didn’t believe me, saying, “Miles, it’s not possible.” I said, “Not possible? You wait and see!”

大家注意到共产党在中东的军事基地是干啥的[吗]？第一个，他就是干这事儿：搞破坏。控制霍尔木兹海峡，控制苏伊士运河，控制吉布提[和]红海的石油运输，最终到马六甲。这就跟当时二战的时候日本的山本五十六和美国的伊顿，在打珍珠岛之前说的话[一样]。“美国是我日本的80%的呃这个油的供应，你有天不供应[给]我咋办呢？”那意思说“老子得打你。”所以就打了珍珠港。

Have you noticed what the CCP is doing in its military bases in the Middle East? The first thing it is doing is sabotage – controlling the Strait of Hormuz, controlling the Suez Canal, controlling the oil transportation in Djibouti and the Red Sea, and finally to Malacca. This is the same as what Isoroku Yamamoto, the Japanese, and the American, Eaton said before Japan attacked Pearl Harbor during World War II. “The United States provided 80% of Japan’s oil supply. What if you don’t supply us someday?” That means “I have to beat you”. So they attacked Pearl Harbor.

现在老共一模一样，你老美，我不控制这个霍尔木兹海峡[和]苏伊士运河，那以后你打我，我咋办呐？[所以中共]现在想：我要把日本（注：可能是口误）把美国的粮给断了，把你的市场给断了。这好啊，他们打吧，他打他的，咱[们]发[咱们的]财。咱叫“以钱灭共”，把他们打的仗，打剩下的战场咱去收拾去吧，对不对？

Now the CCP is exactly like them [Japan]. “What if the U.S. attacks us if I don’t control the Strait of Hormuz and the Suez Canal?” That’s why they [the CCP] are now thinking: “I’m going to cut off Japan… the U.S.’s food [oil] supply and destroy your market.” That’s okay, let them fighter, but we will focus on making money. Let’s call it “taking down the CCP with money”. Let them fight their war, and after it’s done, we will help to clean up the battlefield, right?
