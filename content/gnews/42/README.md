## The Arizona Battleground

## 亚利桑那战场州

Figure Two tabulates by category a total of 254,722 potentially illegal votes. This number constitutes roughly 24 times the alleged Biden victory margin of 10,457 votes. By far the largest category is 150,000 mail-in ballots cast by voters registered after the registration deadline. Another 22,903 absentee ballots were on record as having been returned on or before the postmark date, which is highly unlikely.

图表二按类别分成的表格共有254,722张潜在的非法选票。这个数字大约是所谓的拜登胜利领先10,457选票的24倍。到目前为止，最大的类别是在注册截止日期之后注册的选民投出的15万张邮寄选票。另一个有记录的是22,903张缺席选票，在邮戳日或之前收到，这是极不可能的。

In reviewing the statistics in Figure Two, it is worth noting that Arizona had statistically improbable high voter turnouts in Maricopa and Pima counties; widespread ballot mishandling; and 1.6 million mail-in ballots (which disproportionately leaned towards Biden) which were subjected to much lower standards of certification and ID verification than in-person votes (which leaned toward Trump).

在回顾图二的统计数据时，值得注意的是，亚利桑那州马里科帕县和皮马县有着在统计学上不可能存在的高投票率；大范围的投票处理不当；160万张邮寄选票（不成比例地倾向于拜登）的认证和身份核实标准远低于亲自投票（倾向于川普）。

The Copper State also accomplished the remarkable feat of exceeding 100% turnout of its registered voters. This is indeed a remarkable feat because Arizona does not allow same-day voter registration. The “over-votes” alone totaled 11,676, an amount more than the purported Biden “victory” margin of 10,457.

铜州亚利桑那州还完成了其注册选民的投票率超过了100%，这一项了不起的壮举。这的确是一个了不起的“成就”，因为亚利桑那州不允许选民在同一天注册，同一天投票。仅仅“过多选票”这一项，就有11,676票，比拜登据称“胜利”领先的10,457票还要多。

From the figure, it should also be clear that Arizona boasts a litany of other election irregularities. For example, a total of 19,997 persons voted where they did not reside while 2,000 voters did not have an address at all. 5,790 voters moved out of state or registered to vote in another state, 5,726 out-of-state residents voted in Arizona, and 36,473 individuals voted without providing evidence of citizenship.

从这个图表中，我们可以清楚地看出，亚利桑那州有一长串的选举违规行为。例如，共有19,997人在他们不居住的地方投票，而2,000名选民根本没有地址。5,790名选民已迁出本州或在其他州登记投票，5,726名外州居民在亚利桑那州投票，36,473名个体在没有提供公民身份证明的情况下投票。

## The Georgia Battleground

## 佐治亚战场州

Figure Three tabulates by category a total of 601,130 potentially illegal votes in Georgia. This is more than 50 times the alleged Biden victory margin of 11,779 votes.

图表三按类别分成的表格显示，在佐治亚州共有601,130张潜在的非法选票。这是所谓的拜登领先的11,779张选票的50多倍。

From the figure, we see that the largest category of potentially illegal votes is that of absentee ballots cast requested before or after the statutory deadline. In the state of Georgia, voters have 180 days prior to Election Day to request absentee ballots, according to state law. However, during the 2020 Presidential Election, Georgia officials counted over 305,700 ballots cast by individuals who had requested absentee ballots more than 180 days before the absentee ballot request deadline, in blatant violation of Georgia Election Code.

在图中我们可以看到，潜在非法选票的最大类别是在要求的法定截止日期之前或之后投出的缺席选票。佐治亚州州法律规定，选民在选举日之前有180天的时间来申请缺席选票。但是，在2020年总统选举期间，据佐治亚州的官员统计：有超过305,700张缺席选票的投票人是在规定截止日期180天之前申请的。这公然违反了佐治亚州选举法。

From the figure, we also see that 10,000 ballots of deceased individuals were counted. 15,700 votes were counted from “ghost” voters, that is, voters who requested and submitted ballots under the names of voters who no longer reside at a particular address. Similarly perplexing is that over 1,000 voters without an address cast ballots.

从这个数字中还包括1万张已过世的人的选票。15,700张来自于“幽灵”选民，即有人用已不在某一特定地址居住的人的名字申请并提交了选票。同样令人困惑的是，超过1千名没有地址的人参与投票。

Voting machines –which Georgia election officials were in an inexplicable rush to install leading up to the 2020 election – likewise may account for a substantial number potentially illegal ballots. There were also over 40,000 cases of voters voting in counties in which they did not legally reside, as well as over 66,000 voters who had successfully cast ballots even though they were under the legal voting age of 18.

佐治亚州选举官员在2020年大选前莫名其妙地匆忙安装投票机 – 同样可能导致大量潜在的非法投票。还有4万多名选民在他们没有合法居住的县投票，同样的，有66,000多名选民在未满18岁的法定年龄时成功投票。
