新闻简述：2020年的最后一天，郭先生在盖特里告诉战友们，他不想像往年一样说“新年快乐”，因为他觉得2021年没有人快乐，由于病毒的危害，即使灭了共也不会快乐。他说：2021是决战年，胜利年，灭共的最后一年！并祝战友们2021年战斗胜利，灭共成功！

中英文对照全文：

Hello, my honorable fellow fighters. Today is December 31, 2020, the last day of the year in the Western calendar. Tonight at 8:00 pm New York time, I will attend “I Am Sing-Ro”, which is a show directed by Sister Ping Tang and William Wang with the goal of cultivating goddesses and gods of music for the New Federal State of China. Between 8:00 pm and 12:00 am, I will be spending the new year’s eve with you together. I hope that you all will watch I Am Sing-Ro on GTV or Youtube. Four hours, four hours.

尊敬的战友们好，12月31号。2020年12月31号，阳历的年今天是最后一天了。今天晚上纽约时间下午八点文贵就在《我是音雄》，这个唐平妹妹还有威廉王搞的咱们新中国联邦的培养音乐男神、音乐女神的节目上，八点到十二点和大家度过这个阳历的新年，公历的新年。希望大家到咱们的这个《我是音雄》的 GTV 和 Youtube 频道上去观看。四个小时，四个小时。

To be honest, everyone is wishing me a happy new year at this moment, but I really don’t know what to say. I particularly don’t want to say “happy new year” because I don’t think anyone will be happy in 2021; no one will be happy. You won’t feel happy even after the CCP is taken down because of the damage caused by the virus, which has been seriously underestimated by everybody. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, Mr. Morgan, a non-executive director of GTV, sent me many touching messages. He said, “Miles, in the past year, I indeed realized the greatness of the Whistleblower Movement, GTV, and GNews.” He said, “The world is so crazy. The future of human beings is really so uncertain. The CCP is making such a mess and the world is still being like this, so 2021 must be really, really awful.” Just now, he sent me a message, saying, “I want to reiterate this: it is worse than awful.” I certainly agree with him on this.

哎呀，我说实话，这个时候大家都在祝我这个新年快乐，都在说新年快乐，七哥真是不知道说啥好。我特别不想说“新年快乐”这个词，因为我觉得2021年没有人快乐，不会有人快乐。灭了共你也不会快乐，因为这个病毒的危害，所有人都太轻敌了。昨天还有前天我们的 GTV 的董事摩根先生跟我发了好多感人的信息，他说 Miles 我真的在过去的一年，我真的意识到爆料革命的伟大和 GTV 的伟大和 GNews 的伟大。他说：这个世界真的是太疯狂了，他说：人类真的是未来太无法确定了。他说：这个共产党现在还这么搞，这个世界还这个样子，2021年一定是非常非常的糟。刚才还跟我发信息说我要重复一下，说糟糕中再加糟糕。我当然是这么想了。

Brothers and sisters in arms, I am out of words to express my wishes to you. Should I say “happy new year”, “take care in the new year”, or “stay healthy in the new year”?  People like doing the same thing repeatedly, no matter if it is right or not, and doing the same thing every year habitually. The New Federal State of China and the Whistleblower Movement do not want to repeat anything, especially on the issue of real and fake. The real is always real, and the fake is always fake, we will never repeat it. We will break those mundane and old ideas and create new, beautiful, and real things. Hence, brothers and sisters, I really don’t know if I want to say happy new year. Will you be happy? Who will be happy in the new year? When working out just now, I was thinking, should I say a healthy new year, a safe new year, or a happy new year. It is really hard.

兄弟姐妹们，我不知道该用什么词今天给你们祝福，是新年快乐呢，是新年小心呢，还是新年健康呢？人们都愿意重复，不论是对的错的都愿意继续重复，每一年，习惯性的重复一件事情。新中国联邦和爆料革命不重复任何事情，特别是在真假问题上，假就是假，真就是真，不重复。我们就打破那些尘俗、旧观念，创造新的、美好的、真实的事物。所以说，兄弟姐妹们， 我真不知道说，我说新年好，新年你们能好吗？新年谁能好啊？我刚才我在健身的时候在想，新年健康，新年平安，新年好，新年快乐，很难。

So, 2021 is the most critical year for the New Federal State of China. In the Geng-Zi Year [year 2020], the CCP has lost half of its life. Using General Secretary, Xi Jinping’s original words: “Tai Shan Ya Ding” [the pressure is as heavy as Mount Tai]. In 2021, we hope – not hope – we will definitely make the CCP disappear completely. Take down the CCP! The CCP was finished in 2020 already, politically and internationally. It is also finished regarding its domestic economy and people’s living condition. 2021 will be the year for the whole world to take down the CCP, take down the CCP voluntarily, take down the CCP by the insiders of the CCP, and take down the CCP according to law, and finally it will be concluded with a sudden death [of the CCP]. Therefore, 2021 will be a challenging year for all of us.

那么，我们新中国联邦2021年，对我们来讲可能是最最最关键的一年。庚子年，共产党已经大半条命废掉了。用这个习近平总书记的原话说，叫“泰山压顶”。2021年，我们希望是，我们不是希望，我们一定会让共产党彻底消失，take down the CCP! 政治上、国际上，2020年它已经完了。国内的经济上、民生上，它已经完了。2021年就是全球灭共、自动灭共和以共灭共、以法灭共。最后是总结性的，结束，嘎查结束。所以说，2021年，我们大家都是个挑战年。

What should I wish for our fellow fighters? I wish you win the battle. I should wish our fellow fighters win the battle of taking down the CCP in 2021! I don’t want to say happy new year, which has been repeated for many years. In fact, we have never been happy in the past. I sincerely hope our fellow fighters will win the battle of taking down the CCP. I wish you a victory, a complete victory! I hope the Chinese people will be liberated. I hope human beings will enter a new era without the communist party, and the Chinese people will no longer live as pigs or dogs, will no longer live as slaves, and no longer live as brain-washed zombies.

应该祝战友什么？希望你战斗胜利。应该祝战友们2021年，希望你战斗胜利，灭共成功！我不想说你新年快乐，这种重复了多少年的。我们事实上过去没有快乐过，衷心的祝战友们灭共的战斗成功，灭共之战，胜利，百分之百的胜利！希望中国人得到解放，希望人类都走向一个没有共产党的新时代，让中国人不像猪狗一样、不像奴隶一样，被洗脑的像僵尸一样地活着。

I hope our fellow fighters of the Whistleblower Movement will unite and make our New Federal State of China be recognized in China as well as in the whole world. Uniting more compatriots and warriors, let’s achieve the goals of the New Federal State of China through the approach of the Whistleblower Movement, which are liberating the 1.4 billion Chinese compatriots, making worldwide peace, discovering the truth of the [CCP] coronavirus, working out a solution for the virus as soon as possible (I think it is hard to find the antidote), and preventing the CCP from releasing more new viruses. Every new virus could be the killer of our fellow fighters and their families. While doing these things, we must be selfless and never give up, and this is the core of everything! Other things like “happy new year”, “have a blessed new year”, and “eat and drink well” have been said for years, so there is no need for us to repeat that. So vulgar, right?

希望我们爆料革命的战友们能团结在一起，让我们的新中国联邦在中国大地、在世界大地得到认可。团结更多的同胞和勇士，让我们以爆料革命这个手段实现新中国联邦的目标，解放14亿中国同胞，让世界和平，查出冠状病毒，尽快研究出解决的办法，解药我觉得是很难的，阻止共产党再释放更多的新型病毒。每一个新病毒都可能是杀害我们战友的家人和你自己。这里面一定要无私无我，绝不放弃。这才是核心！其它的什么新年快乐啊，新年幸福啊，吃好喝好啊，咱都说了好多年了吧，咱就不用再重复了，太俗了，对吧？

In addition, brothers and sisters, [I wish] the New Federal State of China to be strong economically, which is the foundation of the NFSC, be strong politically, and unite our fellow fighters. You all heard this morning about the nomination of the “Man of the Year” (the most influential man), and I was contacted by them many times. I said that I am not interested in it at all. I have seen too many people get gold cups, silver cups, or bronze cups, only to shelf them, so what is the use of them? They cannot be used as money. The true honor lies in your heart. As long as we take down the CCP, we can get whatever we want, even if we refuse to. If the CCP is still alive, even your physical body – a hundred pounds or more weight – can disappear in a blink of an eye. This is the core!

另外，兄弟姐妹们，新中国联邦的基础—经济强大，政治强大，还有我们战友们要团结。今天早上大家都知道，这个评先生，那个评影响人物，这之前也有很多跟我联系。我说我没有半点兴趣。我看过太多人拿到金杯、银杯、奖杯、铜杯，搁在那，有啥用啊？不当钱花。真正的荣誉在自己的心里。只要灭了共，要啥有啥，你想不要都不行。共产党在那，瞬间，连你那一百多斤的肉体都随时被消失，这才是核心！

Dear brothers and sisters, at this moment, what I want to say the most is that we must live like the Hong Kong warriors, and remember in heart that Hong Kong is our holy city. We should be as brave and united as the Hong Kong protesters, and never give up. We cannot live as dogs or pigs as what the Chinese have lived like in the past seven decades, living such a humiliating and pathetic life. We cannot say “Fathers and mothers are not as intimated as the party” anymore. We cannot say that the sky is the party’s sky, the earth is the party’s earth, and even our genitals belong to the party.

亲爱的兄弟姐妹们，此时此刻，我最想说的事情，我们要向香港的勇士那样活着，真正的牢记香港是我们的圣城。我们要向香港那样勇敢和团结，永不放弃。我们不能像过去这七十年的中国人一样、像猪狗一样地活着。这样的憋屈，这样的窝囊。不能说“爹亲娘亲不如党亲”, 共产党的天，共产党的地，连我们的生殖器也属于共产党的。

Today’s program, “I Am Singer-Ro” will let us sing our heartfelt songs, which is the sound of taking down the CCP. This has never happened before in human history.

我们的《我是音雄》的节目，今天晚上就是唱出了我们发自内心的歌声，就是灭共的歌声。人类上从来没有过。

The New Federal State of China and the Whistleblower Movement have created legends one after another, along with its influence in the world. Nobody can deny this. This has nothing to do with anybody being good or bad, tall or short, and fat or thin. This belongs to all of the brothers-in-arms of the Whistleblower Movement, which is achieved with their life, blood, and time. This outcome cannot be denied by anyone. Nobody can deny the greatnesses [of our achievement] in the past few years such as Jian Wang, HNA, Qishan Wang, Jianzhu Meng, Lijun Sun, the overseas pro-democracy phonies, hundreds of Chinese companies, the coronavirus, Dr. Bo, January the 19th, the new [CCP] virus, and HCQ – one legend after another, countless. They don’t belong to any individual person, or has anything to do with anybody being good or bad, real or fake, rather they were created by the Whistleblower Movement and the New Federal State of China!

新中国联邦和爆料革命创造的一个又一个的传奇，和对世界的影响。任何人否定不了。这和任何人好坏、高低、胖瘦没任何关系。这是所有的爆料革命战友的，用生命、鲜血和时间换来的。这个结果是任何人无法否定的。没有人可以否定了过去这几年来一个又一个伟大的，王健、海航、王歧山、孟建柱、孙立军、海外欺民贼、几百家的中资企业、冠状病毒、博博士、1/19、新型病毒、羟氯喹。一个又一个的传奇，数不胜数。它不属于任何一个人，它跟任何人好坏、真假没有关系，是爆料革命、新中国联邦创造的！

China has one sixth of the world’s population, but other than the evil CCP, there have been no organizations or platforms that can speak on behalf of the ordinary Chinese people other than GTV and GNews. The economic miracles created by GTV, GNews, the G-Series, GClubs, and GFashion are incomparable. 2020 is just a start. In 2021, we will make even greater miracles and legends. All of these are made by our fellow fighters.

全人类占了六分之一人口的中国，除了一个邪恶的共产党之外，没有任何一个能代表人民发声的组织和平台，只有GTV、GNews。GTV、GNew创造的，G系列、GClubs、GFashion创造的经济奇迹，无人可比。2020年只是个开始，2021年将创造更伟大的奇迹和传奇，都是因为战友。

Brothers and sisters, tonight, from 8:00 pm to 12:00 am, I will be seeing you on the live broadcast of I Am Singer-Ro. I hope our fellow fighters will see more heroic brothers and sisters in arms winning this mysterious award. Everything has already begun. The legendary 2020 will continue into 2021. 2021 is the year of the final battle, the year of victory, the final year of taking down the CCP! Brothers and sisters, everything has already begun. I hope you will use all of your strength and take down the CCP in one fell swoop! Alright?

兄弟姐妹们，今天晚上八点钟到十二点钟，凌晨，文贵在《我是音雄》直播频道上见。希望战友们能看到更多我们的，这个英雄的战友，兄弟姐妹们能获得非常神秘的奖项。一切都已经开始，传奇的2020将延续到2021。2021是决战年，胜利年，灭共的最后一年！兄弟姐妹们，一切都已经开始，希望大家攒足了劲，鼓足了气，一举拿下共产党！中不中？
