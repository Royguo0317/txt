英文標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep 212-213:   Miles Guo: If the Three Gorges Dam will broken, 40 million, even 100 million people would be killed in such disaster and dangers

視頻簡介

1. 近年來，中國社會矛盾激化，民怨四起一觸即發。因徵地強拆，污染問題，廣東、河北、江西、浙江等省發生多起群體性抗暴事件。在中共國，私有財產被執法名義隨意剝奪。
2. 中共禁止內蒙古等6省用少數民族語言授課，中共的該行為，被指是實行民族文化滅絕。近期，內蒙古微信群有人熱議有關停止蒙古語授課，被公安封群抓人。
3. 百年一遇特大洪水，水淹大佛腳。四川地區受到大面積的洪澇災害，放眼望去一片汪洋，百姓生活毀於一旦。唯不見自稱人民的政府施以援手。。
4. (郭文貴, 8/22)如果三峽大壩垮塌，可能造成四千萬人甚至一億人在禍端和危險中喪生。我100％確信，明年整個中國都是大饑荒。毫無疑問。
5. (郭文貴先生，8/22）中共建了三峽大壩。是為了電站的利益。但是他們正在制造一顆巨大的炸彈，並將其投放給世界，投放給中國。另外不要忘記，在該地區有三個核電站，這是他們給世界帶來的最大危險。不僅中國人遭遇饑荒，全世界可能會因為核武器而遇到麻煩。


1. In recent years, social conflicts in Communist China have intensified, and public grievances are on the verge of erupting. Due to land acquisition, demolition and pollution problems, a number of mass riot incidents have occurred in Guangdong, Hebei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and other provinces.  Private properties were seized arbitrarily by the law enforcement in the Communist China.
2. The CCP has banned the teaching of Mongolian language in six provinces, including Inner Mongolia, which has been accused of practicing ethnic and cultural extermination. Such topic had been on fire among WeChat users in Inner Mongolia, but the CCP police has closed these chatting groups and put related people behind bars.
3. Floods immerced the foot of the Leshan Giant Buddha (71m high). The Sichuan region has been devastated by floods and rainstorms which turned streets of Leshan City into sea, and devastated the lives of the people. The CCP government, which claims to represent the Chinese people, has failed to rescue them.
4. (Miles Guo, 8/22) If the Three Gorges Dam will broken, 40 million, even 100 million people would be killed in such disaster and dangers. I am 100% sure there will be a great famine throughout China next year. No doubt about it…….
5. （Miles Guo，8/22) The CCP built the Three Gorges Dam for the benefit of power stations. But they are making a huge bomb and delivering it to the world, to China. Also, please keep in mind that there are three nuclear stations in that area. It is the greatest danger they are bringing to the world. Not only Chinese will suffer from great famine, the whole world might be in troubles due to “nuclear weapons”.
