Today, the President of the United States and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom reaffirm their commitment to work together to realise our vision for a more peaceful and prosperous future.

**今天，美国总统和英国首相重申，他们会致力于共同努力，实现我们对更和平与繁荣未来的愿景。**

Our revitalised Atlantic Charter, building on the commitments and aspirations set out eighty years ago, affirms our ongoing commitment to sustaining our enduring values and defending them against new and old challenges. We commit to working closely with all partners who share our democratic values and to countering the efforts of those who seek to undermine our alliances and institutions.

**我们以80年前的承诺和愿望为基础重启《大西洋宪章》，我们重申，我们将持续致力于维护我们持久的价值观，在面临新旧挑战时捍卫它们。我们承诺，将会与所有认同我们民主价值观的伙伴紧密合作，努力抵制那些试图破坏我们的联盟和机构。**

First, we resolve to defend the principles, values, and institutions of democracy and open societies, which drive our own national strength and our alliances. We must ensure that democracies – starting with our own – can deliver on solving the critical challenges of our time. We will champion transparency, uphold the rule of law, and support civil society and independent media. We will also confront injustice and inequality and defend the inherent dignity and human rights of all individuals.

**首先，我们决心捍卫民主和开放社会的原则、价值观和制度，正是这些原则、价值观和制度，推动着我们自己的国家实力和联盟的建立。我们必须确保民主–从我们自身开始–能够解决我们时代的关键挑战。我们将倡导透明，维护法治，支持公民社会和独立媒体。我们还将对抗不公正和不平等，捍卫所有人固有的尊严和人权。**

Second, we intend to strengthen the institutions, laws, and norms that sustain international co-operation to adapt them to meet the new challenges of the 21st century, and guard against those that would undermine them. We will work through the rules-based international order to tackle global challenges together; embrace the promise and manage the peril of emerging technologies; promote economic advancement and the dignity of work; and enable open and fair trade between nations.

**第二，我们打算加强维持国际合作的机构、法律和规范，使其适应21世纪的新挑战，并防范那些可能破坏它们的人。我们将通过基于规则的国际秩序，共同应对全球挑战；拥抱新兴技术带来的希望，同时应对它带来的危险；促进经济发展和工作尊严；使国家间的贸易能够开放和公平。**

Third, we remain united behind the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We oppose interference through disinformation or other malign influences, including in elections, and reaffirm our commitment to debt transparency, sustainability and sound governance of debt relief. So too will we defend key principles such as freedom of navigation and overflight and other internationally lawful uses of the seas.

**第三，我们在主权、领土完整以及和平解决争端的原则上保持一致。我们反对通过虚假信息或其他恶意影响进行干涉，包括对选举的干预，并重申我们对债务透明度、可持续性和债务减免的健全管理的承诺。我们也将捍卫诸如航行和飞越自由以及其他国际合法下使用海洋的关键原则。**

Fourth, we resolve to harness and protect our innovative edge in science and technology to support our shared security and deliver jobs at home; to open new markets; to promote the development and deployment of new standards and technologies to support democratic values; to continue to invest in research into the biggest challenges facing the world; and to foster sustainable global development.

**第四，我们决心利用和保护我们在科学技术方面的创新优势，以支持我们的共同安全并在国内提供就业机会；开辟新的市场；促进新标准和技术的开发和部署，以支持民主价值观；继续投资于对世界面临的最大挑战的研究；并促进全球可持续发展。**

Fifth, we affirm our shared responsibility for maintaining our collective security and international stability and resilience against the full spectrum of modern threats, including cyber threats. We have declared our nuclear deterrents to the defence of NATO and as long as there are nuclear weapons, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance. Our NATO Allies and partners will always be able to count on us, even as they continue to strengthen their own national forces. We pledge to promote the framework of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace, arms control, disarmament, and proliferation prevention measures to reduce the risks of international conflict. We remain committed to countering terrorists who threaten our citizens and interests.

**第五，我们申明，我们有责任共同维护我们的集体安全和国际稳定，以及抵御各种死灰复燃的现代威胁，包括网络威胁。我们已经宣布，我们拥有核威慑力是为了保卫北约，只要有核武器，即使他们继续加强自己的国家力量，北约就将继续是一个核联盟，我们的北约盟国和伙伴将始终能够依靠我们。我们承诺在网络空间、军备控制、裁军和防核扩散措施方面加快建设负责任的国家行为框架，以减少国际冲突的风险。我们仍然致力于打击威胁我们公民人身财产安全的恐怖分子。**

Sixth, we commit to continue building an inclusive, fair, climate-friendly, sustainable, rules-based global economy for the 21st century. We will strengthen financial stability and transparency, fight corruption and illicit finance, and innovate and compete through high labour and environmental standards.

**第六，我们承诺继续为21世纪打造一个包容、公平、气候友好、可持续、基于规则的全球经济环境。我们将加强金融稳定和透明度，打击腐败和非法金融，并通过高的劳工和环境标准进行创新和竞争。**

Seventh, the world has reached a critical point where it must act urgently and ambitiously to tackle the climate crisis, protect biodiversity, and sustain nature. Our countries will prioritise these issues in all our international action.

**第七，世界已经抵达一个危机时刻，必须采取紧急行动，信心百倍地应对气候危机，保护生物多样性和维持自然。各国将在所有的国际行动中优先考虑这些问题。**

Eighth, we recognise the catastrophic impact of health crises, and the global good in strengthening our collective defences against health threats. We commit to continuing to collaborate to strengthen health systems and advance our health protections, and to assist others to do the same.

**第八，我们认识到健康危机的灾难性影响，以及加强我们集体防御卫生威胁的全球性好处。我们承诺为了加强卫生系统、促进我们的健康保护将会继续合作，并协助其他国家也这样做。**
