In January, 2020 my mother died. Her health had been declining but there was nothing immediately life-threatening. She decided that it was time. Her quality of life was on the wane. She knew it. She decided she wanted to choose “assisted death” while she could still qualify to make the decision herself. My mother was a very strong, principled woman. She truly was my idol, my rock, my model for how to lead my life. Never wanting to be a burden. She was also very aware of what was going on in the World. She did not like what she saw. She was very worried about the bullying by the CCP. This was only about two weeks before the CCP-virus became a headline issue. She did not know about the virus. Her judgement of the CCP was based on what she knew of recent Chinese history and their belligerent behavior.

I am not looking for sympathy. My observation is simply how coincidental, prophetic, or fateful her decision to end her life at that exact time was. She escaped the indignity of being quarantined and isolated from her family in her assisted living home. I miss her every day but when she asked me if I understood and accepted her decision I replied: “of course I understand your decision to end life on your terms, but I will miss you like mad until the end of mine”.

The world has descended into a surreal abyss since then, and yet I have been able to transcend this crippling event, which might have otherwise dragged me into depression, by devoting myself to the Whistleblower Movement and the NFSC, imagined by Miles Guo. As Alexander Graham Bell said: “when one door closes, another opens”. I have passed through the door and it has been transformative.

What propels somebody to want to participate in a Rebellion, a Revolution? The answer is different for different people. In my case, the clues began at a young age. Living next door to the Soviet Union during the cold war meant special drills in school in case of a nuclear attack, leaflets dropped in our mailbox telling us what to do in case of attack, reports of Soviet submarines in our waters, bellicose language and regular threats from the Soviets.

Freedom was something that you learned to cherish from an early age – it was in your genes. Even as a youngster I asked myself what I would do if confronted with a situation like WWII? Would I be a follower and accept the Genocide around me, or would I try my best to be part of the resistance? I told myself I would never accept just being a bootlicker, a sheep. Standing aside to let evil reign supreme was not an option.

When my family began following Miles Guo in 2017 they still believed that Xi Jinping was going to be a positive influence on China. I told them that it would be highly improbable that any leader with that concentration of power, particularly in a country like China, would be a benign force, governing for the benefit of the people. Miles changed their thinking. He washed away the years of indoctrination, and replaced it with facts, wisdom, goodness, truth and faith. What he said rang true. It was incontrovertible. Once in a lifetime, a magnanimous leader comes along who has a mission rooted in love, freedom and faith. He does not like being deified, but he must be acknowledged. He is our general.

No need to go over the decades of evidence that the CCP is an evil terrorist organization again. By now the evidence is myriad. However, plugging into Miles’ webcasts in the early days opened up a new world for us. His knowledge and contacts. The insider information. The passion and faith. The generosity. The realization that this was the struggle of our time, and now was the moment to test the vows I had made in my youth to stand up and resist. We stepped into a world of devotion to the cause. We stepped away from our previous lives. Away from many friends and family – although not by choice. Rare was the person who shared our concerns, or our passion to do anything about it. We have learned to accept that. We are not fighting for comfort, praise, fame or ego. Our most common phrase now is: “I don’t give a shit”!

For me, it was like finding new meaning in life. The evil of the CCP is an unfortunate unifying event, however the coalescing of the Whistleblower Movement has been a beautiful thing. Something that I believe will stand the test of history and time. My late father used to quote a Swedish saying: “mycket tål han skrattas åt, men mera hedras ändå”. Roughly translated that means “he endures much derision, but should be honored more instead”. This has been the experience of our Whistleblower Movement. Much derided and long ignored. Miles, and his movement, have nonetheless risen above the fray and proved themselves worthy of the World’s gratitude and admiration. Charity, selflessness, sacrifice, transcending greed, the examples of heroes – like our own Dr Li-Meng Yan.

This is a David and Goliath story, but the power of righteousness and truth shall prevail. What a feeling that is – savour it! Being on the side of truth and goodness and to know that it will triumph. That is the definition of faith. We all hold onto that feeling. Evil will not reign. The enemy is a paper tiger. A cheap suit ready to fold on exposure to the disinfecting sun of truth. We are building a better suit. A “bespoke” suit. Handmade and tailored to the Chinese people – with justice, faith and freedom for all. Our common cause envelopes the Chinese people. It embraces them. It recognizes their generational struggle. It hears their mute cries. It secerns their shackled conflict.

We shall never bend. We will not compromise, negotiate or abandon our principles. The CCP must be defeated. Removed. The will of the Whistleblower Movement will be done. Righteousness will prevail. Tremble at our determination. Fear the cleansing wave of our truth. Bow before the Revolution. It is inevitable.

My Mother’s strength, determination and principles live in me, and they will not be vanquished.
