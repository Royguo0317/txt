## VII. 2020 Election Voting Machine Irregularities

## VII. 2020年大选投票机违规

Perhaps no device illustrates that technology is a double-edged sword than the machines and associated software that have come to be used to tabulate votes across all 50 states. Types of voting equipment include optical scanners used to process paper ballots, direct recording electronic systems which voters can use to directly input their choices, and various marking devices to produce human-readable ballots.

也许用来给所有50个州的选票制表的机器和相关软件最能说明技术是一把双刃剑。投票设备的类型包括用于处理纸票的光学扫描仪、选民可以直接在上面输入他们所选择内容的直接记录电子系统以及各种标记设备来产生人们便于阅读的选票。

Two main types of voting machine irregularities have been alleged in the 2020 presidential election. As Table 7 illustrates, these types of irregularities include large-scale voting machine inaccuracies together with inexplicable vote switching and vote surges, often in favor Joe Biden.

在2020年总统大选中，有两种主要类型的投票机违规行为。 如图表7所示，这些类型的违规行为包括大规模的投票机失准以及难以解释的选票替换和选票激增，这些违规行为通常都有利于乔·拜登。

### Large-Scale Voting Machine Inaccuracies

### 大范围投票机失准

Much has been made about the shadowy genesis of a company called Dominion which provides voting machines and equipment to 28 states. According to critics, Dominion’s roots may be traced to an effort by the Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez to rig his sham elections. Dominion is also alleged to have ties to the Clinton Foundation, while the Smartmatic software used in the Dominion machines is alleged to have links to the shadowy anti-Trump globalist financier George Soros.

关于一家名为Dominion（多米尼）的公司的阴暗起源已有了很多报道，该公司为28个州提供投票机和设备。据评论家说，多米尼的根源也许可以追溯到委内瑞拉独裁者乌戈·查韦斯为操纵假选举所作的努力。多米尼据称还与克林顿基金会有关联，而据称多米尼机器中使用的Smartmatic软件与阴暗的反川普全球主义者金融家乔治·索罗斯有联系。

The controversy swirling over Dominion and Smartmatic notwithstanding, one of the biggest problems with machine inaccuracies may be traced to a company called Agilis. Nevada election officials in Clark County, a Democrat stronghold in Nevada, used Agilis signature verification machines to check over 130,000 mail-in ballot signatures.

尽管多米尼和Smartmatic的争议不断，但有关设备失准的最大问题之一可以追溯到一家名为Agilis（艾格里斯）的公司。 内华达州选举官员在民主党据点克拉克县使用Agilis签名验证机检查了130,000份邮寄投票的签名。

According to a court case filed in the First Judicial District Court in Carson City, the Agilis machines used a “lower image quality than suggested by the manufacturer.” Clark County Election Department officials also lowered the accuracy rate below the manufacturer’s recommendations, making the whole verification process unreliable.

根据卡森市第一司法地区法院提起的诉讼，Agilis设备使用了“低于制造商建议的图像质量”。 克拉克县选举部官员也将准确率降低到制造商的建议以下，从而使整个验证过程不可靠。

In a test run, it was proven that, at the manufacturer’s setting, the Agilis machine already had a high tolerance for inaccuracies—as high as 50% non-matching. In other words, half of the ballots that might be moved through the machine would be impossible to verify; and Clark County officials lowered that threshold even further.

在一次测试运行中，Agilis设备的出厂设置就被验证有着相当大的失准 – 高达50%的无法匹配。换句话说，可能有一半使用过该设备的选票是根本无法查验的；而克拉克县的官员把这个匹配度降得更低。

As a final comment on this case, there is also the broader legal matter that the Agilis machines were used to “entirely replace signature verification by election personnel.” This is contrary to Nevada state law.

作为对此案的最终评论，还有着更广泛的法律问题，即选举工作人员使用Agilis机器“完全替换了签名验证信息”。这违反了内华达州法律。

As noted in a court case: “In violation of Nevada law, the Clark County Election Department allows the Agilis machine to solely verify 30% of the signatures accompanying the mail-in ballots without ever having humans inspect those signatures.”

正如在一个法院案件中指出的那样：“在与内华达州法律相违背的情况下，克拉克县选举部允许Agilis设备在无人为核查的情况下验证了30%的邮寄选票随附签名。”

A similar problem has been alleged in a court filing in Arizona with a software known as the Novus 6.0.0.0. In cases where ballots were too damaged or illegible to be read by vote tabulation machines, Novus was used in an attempt to cure or restore the ballots. The system would do so by trying to read the applicable scans of the original rejected ballots. However, as noted in a court case filed by Kelli Ward, Chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Party: “the software was highly inaccurate, and it often flipped the vote.”

在亚利桑那州的法院文件中，一款名为Novus 6.0.0.0的软件也被指存在类似问题。如果选票过于残破或难以辨认，以致无法通过选票制表机读取，则使用Novus来试图修复或还原选票。该系统通过尝试读取原始被拒绝选票的适用扫描来完成此操作。但是，正如亚利桑那州共和党主席凯利·沃德（Kelli Ward）提起的诉讼中所指出的那样：“该软件高度失准，而且经常会使选票结果相反。”

### Inexplicable Vote Switching and Vote Surges In Favor of Biden

### 难以解释且偏向拜登的选票替换和选票激增

As a further complication to the Novus software problem in Arizona referenced above, the software was not only highly inaccurate. According to observers, and as an example of inexplicable vote switching, “the software would erroneously prefill ‘Biden’ twice as often as it did ‘Trump.’”

上面提到的亚利桑那州的Novus软件进一步复杂化的问题是，该软件不仅仅是高度失准，这里有个关于难以解释的选票替换的例子，根据观察员的观点，“该软件经常会在每次登记’川普’时错误地换成两次’拜登’。”

At least one instance of a large and inexplicable vote switching and vote surge in favor of Joe Biden took place in Antrim County, Michigan – and it is associated with the controversial aforementioned Dominion-Smartmatic voting machine hardware-software combo. In this Republican stronghold, 6,000 votes were initially, and incorrectly, counted for Joe Biden. The resulting vote totals were contrary to voter registration and historical patterns and therefore raised eyebrows. When a check was done, it was discovered that the 6,000 votes were actually for Donald J. Trump.

至少有一个难以解释的大范围且偏向拜登的选票替换和选票激增的例子是在密歇根州的安特里姆县发生，且与有争议的上述“Dominion-Smartmatic”硬件-软件组合有关。在这个共和党据点，最初有6000选票不正确地统计给了乔·拜登。最终的投票总数与选民的登记和历史记录背道而驰，因此令人震惊。完成检查后才发现6,000张选票实际上是唐纳德·J·川普的。

A subsequent forensic audit of the Antrim County vote tabulation found that the Dominion system had an astonishing error rate of 68 percent. By way of comparison, the Federal Election Committee requires that election systems must have an error rate no larger than 0.0008 percent.

随后通过对安特里姆县投票表进行法医式审计发现，多米尼系统的错误率高达惊人的68％。作为对比，联邦选举委员会要求选举系统的错误率必须低于0.0008％。

Perhaps even more troubling given concerns over hackers and Dominion’s alleged ties to bad foreign actors, the records that would have allowed the detection of remote internet access went missing from the Antrim County system. This was in direct violation of Michigan state law, which requires retention of voting records for 22 months — such information was in place for previous election years, but not this election. At the very least, the results of this audit indicates the need for further investigation of the Dominion system across other states in the country.

或许更令人不安的是对黑客的担忧以及多米尼涉嫌与不良国外分子的联系，安特里姆县系统丢失了可以检测到远程互联网访问的记录。这直接违反了密歇根州法律，该法律要求将投票记录保留22个月-此类信息适用于之前的选举年，但不包含本次选举。至少，这次审核的结果表明需要对本国其他州的多米尼系统进行深入调查。

In Georgia, there were numerous “glitches” with the Dominion machines where the results would change. The most notable of these changes was a 20,000 vote surge for Biden and 1,000 vote decrease for Trump.

在佐治亚州，多米尼设备存在很多会导致结果发生变化的“小故障”。 其中最值得注意的一个是，当川普的投票减少了1,000的同时，拜登的投票激增了20,000。
