**简述：在2021年4月5日的GTV直播中，郭先生批评了美国私人公司的贪婪和对国家毫无责任感，可是皮之不存，毛将焉附？另外美国官员和执法部门的腐败、被中共的收买和无知使他们对共产党的威胁完全没有认识。随着美国经济和黄金出问题，共产党的以钱灭美计划、灭白计划、3F计划和“蓝金黄”的深度影响将逐渐会显现出来。**

**美国人对共产党的威胁和觉醒远远不够**

**Americans’ Understanding of the CCP’s Threat Is Far From Enough**

这个国家现在是华尔街和好莱坞还有美国科技公司的腐败贪婪，它最终它要付出代价的。就像美国的私人公司 3M 公司在美国最需要口罩的时候，它就在电视上说：“欸，我没有义务给你口罩啊。”对呀，就像川普还有皮特纳瓦罗还有蓬佩奥都说美国是私人公司，私人公司一切向往利益，它完全不考虑政治。这是对的，按规则说是对的，但是这个国家要完了，你这私人企业也都完球蛋。他们太贪婪了，你跟共产党做生意，你去！

The corruption and greed of Wall Street and Hollywood as well as Big Tech companies in this country will eventually make this country pay the price. Just like when the Americans needed masks the most, the private company 3M said on TV: “Hey, I have no obligation to give you masks.” Yes, it’s just like what Trump, Peter Navarro and Pompeo said: the United States is like a private company, and all private companies seek profits and don’t care about politics at all. That is correct. Theoretically, it is right, but if this country is going to be over, you, a private enterprise, will be over too. They are too greedy. If you want to do business with the CCP, just go ahead.

美元都没了你啥都没了，什么美国的豪宅呀、自由女神啊、民主啊、信仰，想啥都没了。这个国家是高成本地运作，完全靠一个高成本、高质量法律体系，维护的就是一个问题——美元。美国唯一让美元能够存在就是美国的航空母舰、美国的强大的军队和国家的科技能力。当美元没有的时候美国军队就没了，美国军队没了美国的利益就没了，美国利益就没了，这些人才也不聚集美国了，美国就完了。那你说美国企业呢还有行吗？像Elon Musk这样的人他就不会待在美国，他弄不好迁都，把他公司迁到香港、去上海去了或者到欧洲去了。

When the U.S. dollar is gone, you will lose everything, including your mansions in the U.S., the Statue of Liberty, democracy, faith, and everything you can think of. This country operates at a high cost. It relies entirely on a high-cost and high-quality legal system to maintain just one thing – the U.S. dollar. The only thing the U.S. relies on to keep the existence of U.S. dollar is its aircraft carriers, its powerful military, and the its technological capabilities. When the U.S. dollar is gone, the military will be gone, and when the U.S. military is gone, the interests of America will be gone, and when the American interests are gone, the U.S. will never attract talents to come here, and then America will be done. Do you think American companies will still be okay? People like Elon Musk would not stay in the U.S. anymore. He could move his headquarters to Hong Kong, Shanghai, or Europe.

这是美国人他一定要意识到的，现在你看到美国这个下边的官员，不管这些执法部门的腐败到了什么程度。腐败、被收买和无知，对共产党的威胁完全没有认识。没有我们新中国联邦没有爆料革命美国人绝对达不到今天这个程度，今天美国人对共产党的威胁和觉醒远远是不够的。

This is what Americans must be aware of. Now you see how severe the corruption of the officials in the U.S. government and all kinds of law enforcement agencies has become. Look at their corruption, how they’re being bribed, how ignorant, and how they totally have no idea about the threat of the CCP. If not for our New Federal State of China (NFSC) and Whistleblower Movement, definitely Americans would not reach the level of understanding that they have today. Nevertheless, Americans’ understanding of the threat of the CCP is still far from enough.

这次美国经济出了问题、黄金出了问题，共产党的以钱灭美的计划和灭白计划和制造种族对立矛盾的计划和“蓝金黄”的深度逐渐会显现出来。

This time, the U.S. economy has encountered problems and the gold price has encountered problems. The deep effect of the CCP’s plan to destroy the U.S. with money and its plan to eliminate white people and to create racial conflicts and its BGY plot will gradually become apparent.

然后美国这两万亿美元所谓的基建和一万多亿美元的基建，这三万多亿美元都要从企业家的身上拿出来，企业家会再从这些穷老百姓手里拿回来。但这个过程它是需要时间的，它不是一天两天，它不像共产党一样把马云、马化腾是不是把这些老板全抓了，它做不到的，国家就没了。

And then the so-called $2 trillion infrastructure plan and the additional over $1 trillion in infrastructure, a total of over $3 trillion must be taken from entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurs will take the money from the hands of the deplorables. But this process will need time; not one or two days. It will not be like the CCP robbing all the bosses such as Jack Ma and Ma Huateng. It [the U.S.] cannot be like that, otherwise, the country will be done for.

它要一个时间，在这个时间当中可能美国人就完全失去了世界第一经济强国、第一科技强国、第一军事强国、第一信用之国和信用美元体系全部崩塌。剩下的美国可能是哪儿叫美国，德州德克萨斯叫美国，美塔那、马塔那叫美国，爱荷华州，Idaho 就是黄石公园叫美国，其它都不叫美国，像什么纽约、洛杉矶啊估计都乱了。

It will need some time, but during this process, Americans will likely completely lose the world’s largest economic power, the largest technological power, the largest military power, and the number one creditworthy country, and the credible U.S. dollar system will completely collapse. The rest of the U.S. that may still be called America will be places like Texas, Montana, and Idaho – where the Yellowstone is. And the rest will not be America anymore, such as New York and Los Angeles, where I guess will be totally messed up.

这就是共产党想要的，搞弱、搞乱、搞死美国、蓝金黄、三F方案、蓝金黄方案、灭白计划。这都是共产党是一系列的，从科恩，从IMF世界银行，从所有的，从国会，从情报部门儿，从司法部门，你看那 Higginbotham 那司法部的，就为了遣返郭文贵他能收几百万、几千万美元。

This is exactly what the CCP wants – to weaken, to mess up, and to kill the U.S. (a.k.a., the 3F plan), to employ the BGY plot, and to exterminate the white people. These are a series of plans of the CCP, starting from Khan in the IMF World Bank (Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former President of IMF), to the Congress, to the intelligence departments, to the Justice Department. You look at (George) Higginbotham in the Department of Justice, who accepted millions, tens of millions of dollars of bribes to just to repatriate me, Miles Guo.

刘特佐，你看刘特佐那什么概念，把马…大家还记得吧，马哈蒂尔上去了把纳吉布干掉了，人家纳吉布又派了个把马哈蒂尔干掉了，马哈蒂尔上来以后现在弄了个西丁外交部长，就是人家纳吉布的人家的亲表兄弟，人家纳吉布的亲表弟又回到北京，在刘特佐的安排下，孟建柱的私生子的安排下，公开在外交部喊：“王毅你是我大哥”，哈哈，共产党这邪恶到啥程度。

Jo Low, you look at Jo Low. People may remember that Mahathir came to power to replace Najib, but Najib sent another one to replace Mahathir. After Mahathir came to power, he hired Hishammuddin (Hishammuddin bin Hussein) as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who is the cousin of Najib. And this cousin of Najib’s went to Beijing, which was arranged by Jo Low, who is Meng Jianzhu’s illegitimate son, and publicly called Wang Yi in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, “You are my elder brother.”  Haha, how evil is the CCP!

你再看看阿拉斯加那个会面，大家我最起码我在那个YouTube上我看了三遍了，我认真地看了三遍。每一个字儿、每一句话都是精心的安排。每一个字儿、每一句话都是对美国的羞辱和侮辱。那个阿拉斯加的见面绝对等同于当年撒切尔夫人在北京跌倒那一跤。

Please also look at the meeting in Alaska, everyone. I’ve watched it at least three times on YouTube, very carefully. Every word and every sentence was carefully written. Every word and every sentence is a humiliation and insult to the U.S. The Alaska meeting is absolutely equivalent to the incidence when Margaret Thatcher fell in Beijing years ago.
