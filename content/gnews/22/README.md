視頻簡介

1. 中共強迫內蒙古漢化、實施蒙古文化滅絕政策、取消蒙古語言教學，遭內蒙民眾抗議並拒絕讓其子女返回學校。據蒙古族警員爆料，中共為控制蒙語事件發展， 大量逮捕抗議的蒙古族百姓，手段卑劣，暴力兇殘。
2. 內蒙強推漢語授課，學生抗議跳樓身亡。另有蒙古族教師也是以自殺方式表達決心捍衛蒙古文化。中共國內蒙古教育局的解決方式就是冒充家長簽字，派出大巴車隊強接蒙古族孩子去學校。
3. 9月5日湖南漵浦縣，本來準備收稻穀，結果洪水先到達了,全被大水沖壞了。網友視頻爆料，湖南仍然洪水氾濫，但中共國政府及媒體毫無相關報導，農田遭殃，百姓受苦。
4. 9月6日，港人走上街頭，抗議港版國安法，要求恢復立法會選舉，抗議港府推行的健康碼。防暴警員採取近似中共解放軍穿插分割戰術，強行鎮壓遊行，暴力逮捕至少90位無辜民眾。
5. （Miles Guo在9/4战室）无论经济，技术还是失业，美国都是中共的最大受害者。 但是，看看中国人，有14亿人处于沉睡状态，受0.0000001控制，我不知道有多少个零，只有大约10个家庭，这些大家庭控制着整个中国并使人们保持沉睡状态。


1. The Chinese Communist Party is forcing Inner Mongolia to become Sinicized, implementing the policy of extermination of Mongolian culture and abolishing the teaching of Mongolian language, but the Mongolian people protest and refuse to let their children return to school. According to an Mongolian police officer, the CCP is speeding up the arrests of Mongolian people and cracking down the peaceful protests to control this event. The tactics of the CCP were despicable and violent.
2. The CCP is forcing Chinese language classes in Inner Mongolia, and students jumped to their deaths in protest. And other Mongolian teacher also committed suicide to express their determination to defend Mongolian culture.Meanwhile, the Education Bureau in Inner Mongolia enforces this policy by sending unwilling Mongolian children to school by impersonating their parents and signing their names.
3. On September 5 in Xupu County, Hunan Province, the rice grains were ready to be harvested, but the flood came first. Everything were washed away. A netizens’s video showed that Hunan was still flooded, but the CCP did not report anything about it, so the harvest was gone and the suffered people had no way to get aids.
4. September 6, Hong Kong people marched in Kowloon against the Hong Kong National Security Law and demanded the resumption of the Legislative Council elections. They oppose the HK government’s implementation of a health code for resuming customs clearance with the mainland, which would put personal safety and privacy data in jeopardy. The riot police of HK adopted the tactics similar to that of the PLA controlled by the CCP, to forcibly suppress the peaceful march. At least 90 innocent people were arrested at Mong Kok.
5. (Miles Guo at War room 9/4)  The US is the biggest victim of the CCP, whether in the economy, the technology or job loss. But, you look at the Chinese, 1.4 billion people are kept asleep, controlled by 0.0000001, I don’t know how many zeros, only about 10 families, and these big families control the whole of China and keep people asleep.  In America, maybe only 10% of people control the entire America and all the assets, right?
