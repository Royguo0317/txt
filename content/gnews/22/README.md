英文標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep219: Declaration of the New Federal State of China

視頻簡介

1. 中国共产黨抢占私有財產，欺壓百姓，以黑治國。中共宣傳地攤經濟，同時城管當街搶劫攤主，踐踏私有財產，在中共的極權统治下，无法治可言。
2. 捷克參議院議長維特齊無懼中共威脅、打壓，率領有史以來訪台層級最高的捷克官員於8月30日至9月4日訪問台灣。之前布拉格市長拒絕”一中”（一個中國）承諾並與北京斷交，隨後訪問台灣支持民主政權。此次代表團所帶口罩為台灣捐贈。捷克參議長維特齊率團訪台，
3. 全球聯合行動，遊行反抗，自由發聲，追求民主自由法制。新中國聯邦繼續全球連動大遊行，相繼在洛杉磯，舊金山，台灣台北和韓國開展抗議活動，反對中共，捍衛民主，聲援香港。
4. 新中國聯邦宣言：我們因爆料革命凝聚在一起，為實現新中國法治、民主和自由而組成喜馬拉雅監督機構。
5. （8月29日，連線台灣參加遊行戰友們）我給你們今天說一個好消息。就在我剛剛，就這一次直播前，這中間我有三個會議，這個會議當中，其中有一個就是關係到台灣的未來重大的使命、重大的事件和重大的改變。


1. The CCP is used to terrorize people, fleece them of their wealth with the same behavior of a drug cartel. Although the CCP’s propaganda promoted a street-vendor economy, their Urban Management Officers are robbing vendors in broad daylight and trampling on private property rights. There is no rule of law under communist regime.
2. Czech Senate Speaker Vystrcil arrived in Taiwan on official visit from August 30th to Sept. 4th, braving CCP’s threats and represals. He led the highest-level delegation in the history of the country’s bilateral relations with Taiwan, who, by the way, wore the masks donated by Taiwan during the pandemic. Previously, the Mayor of Prague rejected the “One China” policy and cut off diplomatic ties with Beijing. He later visited Taiwan in support of the democratic government.
3. Global alliance against the CCP, speaking out for the freeedom of speech, democracy and the rule of law. The New Federal State of China continues its global march in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Taiwan and South Korea, to protest against the CCP, defend democracy, and support Hong Kong.
4. Declaration of the New Federal State of China :It is the Whistleblower’s Movement that has brought us together! In order to realize the Rule of Law, Democracy, and Freedom in the New Federal State of China, we have established the Himalaya Supervisory Organization.
5. (Live streaming with protestors in Taiwan, 8/29) I have good news for you guys today. Between now and my last live streaming, I attended three meetings, and one of them was about the future of Taiwan, its significant missions, great events and major changes.
