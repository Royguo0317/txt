新闻简述：在2021年2月1日的第二段盖特视频中，郭文贵先生让各国找中南坑的共产党找病毒解药，还警告共产党的帮凶们停止作恶，对爆料革命的战友枪口抬高一寸，否则会成为共产党的陪葬。

**All Nations Should Ask the Zhongnan Pit for the Antidote; CCP Members, Stop Doing Evil!**

**各国都应该找中南坑要解药；共产党员，枪口抬高一寸，停止作恶！**

Jeez! You just saw me in a suit and the heavy snow that I recorded. Now I’ve finished my meeting and am enjoying a cup of coffee. Aiya, nice coffee, pretty nice. Brother Seven’s bad habit – eating ice pops. Do you know the feeling of enjoying such nice coffee and eating ice pops like this one? I found that I’ve got two yellow Hermes sweaters like this one, Gosh! Haven’t worn this one before maybe. Mmmm…

乖乖！刚刚你们看我[穿]西装，录的那个下大雪的那个感觉[的视频]以后，我现在开完会啦，喝杯咖啡。哎呀，这好咖啡，相当[好]的咖啡。七哥的不良嗜好，冰棍儿。你说喝着这么好的咖啡，吃着这冰棍，啥感觉，啊？我发现这黄色爱马仕毛衣，我有两件儿，天哪！这件儿好像没穿过。呣嗯~

Another thing, want to thank Mr. Hashimoto from Japan for the strawberries. Mmmm… look at this strawberry! Does it look the same as an ordinary strawberry? It is completely different. These are Japanese strawberries, which are over ten times more expensive than American ones. So, this is what “quality” means. Quality is time and wisdom. You have to pay for quality.

还有，谢谢日本的桥本先生，[给的]草莓。呣嗯~ 这个草莓，你看看！你看看[和普通的比]一样吗？完全不一样。这个草莓是日本草莓，这个日本草莓是美国草莓的十几倍[的]价格。所以说什么叫质量？质量就是时间，就是智慧。质量你是要付钱的。

Since this morning, I believe that, the military intelligence agencies of different countries have all been thinking that the CCP has this unsuccessful vaccine, so it definitely owns the antidote! Who said that? I, Miles said that. What should we do then? Ask the CCP for the antidote, right? It’s simple. Want to live? If you want to live, just go and ask for the antidote. Ask who? Ask the CCP. Where? The ZhongNan Pit. Brothers and sisters, do you think the foreigners would believe this or not? Do you think they would believe this? We have the verification from experts around the world when we say something.

今天上午到现在，各国军方情报机构，我相信他们都在想，共产党有这个没成功的疫苗，绝对有解药！谁说的？郭文贵说的。那咋办哪？找共产党要解药去啊，对吧？这好办，想活吧？想活就[去]要解药去。找谁？找共产党啊。地点，中南坑儿。兄弟姐妹们，你说外国人信不信？你们说他们信不信吧？咱说话的时候，它有全世界[各个]专家的印证。

You don’t have to believe this. I didn’t charge you any money. What’s good about our WM and NFSC? We are pursuing a belief, we don’t care who will follow us, and we don’t care who wants to buy it or not, right? Also we don’t care if you believe it or not. You can choose not to believe it, right? The virus is not made by us after all, but I can tell you the answer.

你可以不信啊，我又不要你钱，咱这爆料革命和新中国联邦这个买卖做得好在哪儿啊？我们在追求一种信仰，不在乎谁跟随，不在乎你付不付钱，不在乎你买不买，对吧？也不在乎你信不信，你可以不信啊，是吧？这病毒又不是我们产的，但我告诉你们答案。

Why do all mankind love to read the story of Ali Baba? They all want to be the one who found the key and said “Open, sesame”. We can let everyone find that place where Ali Baba hided his treasures and let everyone know how to open the door. Right, BIAs? So, what do you compete for with the CCP? If you want to compete with it in terms of bravery, it doesn’t have bravery. If you want to compete with it in terms of wisdom, it doesn’t have wisdom. It has only ruthlessness and shamelessness. Then, what do we do now? Let’s compete selflessness with it, because we don’t care. Will they [intel agencies] believe? Look. Today they’ve said so and so. I said,”you can disbelieve it, right?” “Any proof?” “No proof.” “We have intelligence, and you can go verify that, right?”

这个人类啊，为什么都爱看阿里巴巴的故事啊？都想成为找到那把钥匙的人，都想成为芝麻开门[的]那个人。我们能让每个人都能找到阿里巴巴藏宝的那个地方，而且你都会芝麻开门，对吧，战友们？所以说跟共产党你得斗什么？你得跟他斗勇，他没有勇。你跟他斗智，他没有智。他只有狠、下流。那咱现在干什么呀？斗无我吧，因为我们不在乎。他们信不信？你看他们今天说，啊~怎么怎么样。我说你可以不信啊。证据？没有证据啊。我们有情报，你去核实去吧，对吧？

Just like so many people buying membership cards from G-CLUBS, right? Many people have asked me why they should buy. Give me a reason. I said, “You don’t have to buy. There are plenty of club cards out there. Go and buy from others. Don’t have to buy from G-CLUBS. Don’t buy, right? Don’t buy from G-Fashion, either. Brands from all over the world are losing money, go and buy from them, right? Don’t buy from our G-Fashion, right?”  They asked, “why should someone do live broadcast on GTV?” I said, “You’d better do your live broadcast on some LeeTV or YouTube, or some other platforms.” Wait for our GTV and Getter. Wait and see what secret weapons I will show you.

就像有人买G-CLUBS的，这么多人买G-CLUBS，是吧？很多人说我为什么[要]买？给我个理由。我说你可以不买啊，有的是俱乐部卡，你去买别人去，买什么G-CLUBS？不要买嘛，对吧？不要买G-Fashion。全世界的品牌全都赔钱，你买他们的[品牌]去，是吧？不要买我们G-Fashion，对不对？直播，他们说，为什么要到GTV直播？我说你去什么 LeeTV、YouTube，去别的地方直播去嘛。等着我们GTV、盖特。走着看，看给你们亮点儿什么杀器！

CCP, I know each and every member of you is watching me live, right? You know how many people are watching. The new order of countering the WM has been issued nationwide. I’ve known all of these too well. You guys, don’t do evil things. I have no grudges with you. To point your muzzle up one inch higher for our WM BIAs won’t do you any bad. You guys know what the CCP is like.

共产党，我知道你们每个人都在看我在这儿直播，是吧？多少人看，你们自己知道。新的平爆的政策在全国下发，我都知道。你们别作恶，我跟你们无仇无冤。对我们爆料革命的战友，枪口抬高一寸，对你们没坏处。共产党啥样你们清楚。

The family members of the superiors who gave you orders, will their anuses be examined? Where are their family members studying at? [What we are doing] doesn’t stand in your way. What I want to annihilate is the ZhongNan Pit, and you will be saved. Don’t be silly! It’s understandable that you need to fulfill your duty, but don’t cross the line. If you cross the line, when the time comes, you will be like the Kuomintang Party. Before Kuomintang ended its ruling, how many evil things had it done? Haven’t they all been “liquidated” after all? Never ever be the last killers of a dynasty in decline. That is a stupid thing to do.

给你们下命令的领导，他家人会被检查肛门吗？他们家里边人在哪儿上学呢？碍你个毛的事儿啊？我要灭的是中南坑，救的是你们，别傻啦！你完成工作可以理解，但别做过分。[如果]做过分，到时候，像[当年的]国民党一样。国民党灭亡前，干了多少坏事啊？最后不都清算了吗？永远不要做没落的皇朝最后的杀手，那是愚蠢的。

Can you guys stop this [trend]? Over one billion Chinese trust Miles Guo and the WM. Can you stop this? No matter how harsh your punishments are to our BIAs, can you stop the progress of this great era? Did you develop the virus? Won’t your family die of the virus if infected? I’ve said that the CCP is corrupt, but are you corrupt? Is others’ bribe money in your pocket?  Why do you sacrifice your life to save them? Right? We are all grassroots, including me, Miles Guo. My family couldn’t even afford to eat salted pickles, or get treated when sick, right? We are on the same boat, right?

你们能挡得住吗？十几亿中国人，他们信郭文贵，信爆料革命，你能挡得住吗？你对我们任何一个战友，[无论]实施多么严厉的刑罚，你能挡得住这个大时代吗？病毒是你研究[出来]的吗？你们家感染病毒了以后，就不死吗？共产党我说它腐败，你腐败了吗？他腐败的钱是不是你的？你干嘛替他卖命？对不对呀？我们都是草根儿，包括我郭文贵。我家原来连咸菜[这种]吃的都没有，家人有病看不起病，对吧？咱们是一样的，对不对呀？

Can you afford this coffee? I can, why can’t you? I didn’t get it by cheating. I am not like the CCP, whose corrupt money are exploited from you. You are the ones who get exploited. Just like now, the whole world is going after the CCP for retaliation. The virus was made by this organization, right? Those who point their muzzles up one inch higher for any of our BIAs in China will be remembered by us forever, but about the ones who impose various penalties and inflict torture of any type on our BIAs, we will never let go any one of them! You don’t have to believe me, but let’s wait and see. Sun Lijun, Meng Jianzhu, Wang Qishan, Zhang Pengming, Liu Jianguo and Fu Zhenghua are your best examples. It’s said that Fu Zhenghua is done, and he will be more miserable than Sun Lijun.

你喝得起这个咖啡吗？我喝得起，为啥你喝不起？我不是骗来的。我不是共产党，贪污的你们身上的钱。你们是被剥削者，就像现在全世界，都在找共产党算账，病毒是它家造的，对吧？任何对我们国内战友，枪口抬高一寸的，我们永远不会忘记。对我们战友施加各种刑罚的，一个也不会放过！你可以不信，走着看。孙立军、孟建柱、王岐山、张鹏明、刘建国，就是你们最好的例子，傅政华。听说傅政华要完了，傅政华比孙立军还要惨。

Yummy! Brothers and sisters, wait for the good news. The whole world is looking for the antidote from the CCP. So many things happen in every hour and every quarter. The “black hand” behind the coup in Myanmar was the CCP. Many have asked me whether it was CCP or not. I said it was. The CCP did it.

真好吃，兄弟姐妹们，等着好消息，全世界都去找解药去啦，找共产党。发生多少事儿啊，这每时每刻每小时。缅甸的事情背后黑手就是共产党，很多人在问我是不是？我说是的，就是共产党。

I’m going to stop here today and then resume a meeting. Will continue to take down the CCP, and continue to make money for BIAs. Thank you so much! The heavy snow outside looks really nice. Will let you have a look. Look at the heavy snow. Interesting.

咱今天先聊到这，我还得继续开会去。继续灭共，继续为战友们挣钱，唔该晒啦！外面的大雪真舒服，让你们看一眼。你看看，看这大雪，是吧？有意思啊。
