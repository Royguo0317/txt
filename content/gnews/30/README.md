**中英文对照全文**

Hello, honorable fellow fighters! We’ve got all kinds of information from many fellow fighters these days. Thank you very much! Really appreciate it! The Department of Domestic Security across the country [China] and other security departments have threatened GTV investors with their family, provided them with the FBI tip webpage and phone number, and asked them to report to FBI that they were scammed [by GTV]. They are definitely trying to frame us.

尊敬的战友们好！我们这几天收到了很多战友们发来的各种信息，非常非常的感激和感谢！就是各地的国保、安全部门，用家人做威胁，让他们作为曾经参与了GTV投资的人，还给了FBI举报的网址和电话，要求到FBI举报，说我被诈骗了。这完全是栽赃陷害！

The CCP is all about faking, right? But, CCP, don’t forget that the United States is not the kind of country that will let you off that easy. Do you think that you have won a big victory now? A complete victory? People who live by the sword die by the sword. CCP, your fortune started from corruption and greed, from deception, and from fraud. Ultimately, you will die from the fake and fraud. Do you think it will work by making fraudulent statements to the FBI and bribing a few people?

共产党就造假嘛，是吧？但是，共产党你千万别忘了，美国这个国家不是你造了假就能过得去的。你以为现在现场就是你大赢了？你彻底赢了？仗剑之人必死于剑下，你共产党你这种以黑起家、以贪起家、以假起家、以骗起家，最终会倒在假和骗上。你以为你到 FBI 报假案，你买通几个人你就能行了吗？

Brothers and sisters in arms, I understand the hardship and the threats that you are facing. But this is something that happens unavoidably in the fighting with the CCP. But I appreciate your courage, and I am really touched by your courage towards me, GTV, and all the other fellow fighters. Brothers and sisters in arms, please remember, under the threat of the CCP, everything that you do is understandable. However, it would be ideal if you could let us know, particularly, about things like being forced to make a fraud report to the FBI. Being forced to make a false report to the FBI is a serious international crime. It will be even better if you have recorded voice and video, right?

兄弟姐妹们，理解你们所有的难处，理解你们的威胁，但是这就是我们共产党当中、博弈当中必然要发生，要有的。但是很感谢战友们你们的勇敢，还要你们对文贵、对GTV、对所有的战友的这种勇气，文贵是非常非常的感动。兄弟姐妹们，但是一定要记住，在共匪的威胁之下，你做什么都可以理解的。但是让我们知道是最好了，特别上美国FBI报假案这种事情。被逼迫报假案，那是重大的国际跨领域的司法犯罪。有语音、有录像，那就更好了，更好了，是吧？

Thinking that yesterday President Trump was about to hand over the gun, the CCP has become even more crazy and faked criminal cases like insane. CCP, I am your eighth generation ancestor. You are like dogs that can never change your habit of eating shit, you ba\*tards! Let’s wait and see. Don’t be too shameless. I am still saving face for you, but if you don’t want to save your face, then I will screw all of you, you ba\*tards – words from Brother Haidong and Sister Ying are now famous. You bastards. But most of those with a conscience have had their guns raised by an inch. For that I really appreciate it! Thank you!

以为昨天，好家伙，这家伙川普总统要交枪了，共产党就更疯狂了，疯狂的制造刑事虚假案子，我R你八辈祖宗，共产党。你狗改不了吃屎，你这帮孙子，走着看，别给脸不要脸。我给你们留着脸哪，但是你们要是不要脸了，那咱就一堆儿给你烩了吧，这帮孙子啊，海东弟，颖妹妹的话，现在成名话了。这帮孙子。但是绝大多数有良知的人，还都是枪口抬高一寸的。我也非常感谢！谢谢！
