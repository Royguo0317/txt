# Democrat Methods to Dramatically INCREASE Absentee and Mail-In Ballot Voting

# 民主党大幅增加战场州的缺席及邮寄选票的方法

Let’s turn next to an examination of the various methods the Democrats used to dramatically INCREASE absentee and mail-in ballot voting in the battleground states. As previously introduced, Figure Six below illustrates the seven principal methods. These methods were identified from an analysis of the various modifications made to state election laws and rules and procedures in advance of the 2020 presidential election.

接下来，我们来研究一下民主党人在战场州中大幅增加缺席及邮寄选票所使用的各种方法。 如前所述，下面的图六说明了七种主要方法。 通过分析2020年总统大选前各州对选举法、规则和程序进行的修改确定了这些方法。

Note that a checkmark in a given cell in the matrix indicates that particular mechanism was present in a particular state. For example, universal mailing of absentee and/or mail-in ballots was observed in both Nevada and Wisconsin. Similarly, there is an increase in voting through the use of drop boxes in Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.

注意图中单元格里的对号表示此州存在对应的方法。例如，内华达州和威斯康辛州都发现了普遍邮寄缺席和/或邮寄选票。同样，在佐治亚州，密歇根州和宾夕法尼亚州，都通过使用投票箱来增加投票数量。

Of the six battleground states, Georgia and Wisconsin were subject to six of the seven methods of boosting absentee and mail-in ballot voting while at the other end of the scale Arizona was subject to three.

在这六个战场州中，佐治亚州和威斯康辛州采用了增加缺席及邮寄选票的七种方法中的六种，而亚利桑那州则采用了三种。

## Relaxed Mail – in / Absentee Ballot Requirements

## 放宽邮寄及缺席选票的要求

The relaxation of absentee and mail-in ballot requirements was accomplished in a variety of ways.

运用各种各样的方法放宽对缺席及邮寄选票的要求

For example, on March 27, the Dane and Milwaukee County Clerks in Wisconsin issued guidance to voters that the pandemic was grounds for anyone to be considered an “indefinitely confined” voter.58 In effect, this gutted the ID verification process for anyone who chose to identify as indefinitely confined because it allowed these voters to cast their ballots without presenting proper ID as a condition for an absentee ballot.59

例如，3月27日，威斯康辛州的戴恩（Dane）和密尔沃基（Milwaukee）县工作人员向选民发布了指导意见，称疫情可以使任何人被视为“无限期行动受限”的选民。实际上，这种做法为任何选择认定为“无限期行动受限的”选民废除了身份验证过程，因为它允许这些选民投票时不用出示适当的身份证件，作为缺席投票的条件。

As a result of this change, the number of indefinitely confined voters surged in Dane and Milwaukee counties – two Democrat strongholds – from 72,000 in 2019 to over 240,000 by November 3, 2020.60 Within the context of Democrat Party’s Grand Strategy, this was a twofer. The guidance simultaneously expanded the universe of absentee and mail-in ballot voters while lowering the level of scrutiny of these ballots.

由于这个变化，在民主党的两个大本营丹恩和密尔沃基县，“无限期行动受限的”选民人数激增， 从2019年的72,000增加到2020年11月3日的24万多。在民主党的宏大战略的背景下，这是一个一箭双雕的做法。该指南在降低了对这些选票的审查水平的同时，扩大了缺席和邮寄选票的范围。

Similarly, in Pennsylvania, a lawsuit was filed by the Democrat Party on July 10, 2020, citing Act 77’s provisions to expand absentee voting for all Pennsylvania registered voters.61 On September 17, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Democrat Party, allowing a three-day receipt deadline for absentee ballots postmarked by 8 PM on Election Day (November 3). In other words, ballots with a “pre-election” postmark were counted as long as they were received by 5 PM on November 6th, three days after polls closed. 10,000 absentee ballots in Pennsylvania were received after 8:00 PM on November 3.62

同样，在宾夕法尼亚州，民主党于2020年7月10日提起诉讼，援引第77号法案的规定，将缺席投票范围扩大到所有宾夕法尼亚州登记的选民。9月17日，宾夕法尼亚州最高法院做出了有利于民主党的裁决，允许在选举日（11月3日）晚上8点之前收到缺席选票的截止日期设为三天。 换句话说，只要盖有“大选前”邮戳的选票在11月6日下午5点收到就可以，即投票结束后三天。11月3日晚上8:00之后，在宾夕法尼亚州收到了10,000张缺席选票。

## Legalizing Universal Mailing of Mail-in/Absentee Ballots

## 使邮寄/缺席选票的普遍邮寄合法化

Several states across the U.S. conduct all mail-in voting. These include Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. In other words, these states send mail-in ballots automatically without the voter’s consent. However, universal mail-in ballots are historically subjected to higher rates of fraud due to lack of I.D. verification, individuals submitting ballots multiple times without being detected, and voting under the identity of another individual; and each of these examples are apparent during the 2020 Presidential Election.

美国有几个州全部实行了邮寄投票。这些州包括科罗拉多州，夏威夷州，俄勒冈州，犹他州和华盛顿州。 换句话说，这些州未经选民同意即自动邮寄选票。 然而，由于缺乏身份验证，从历史上看，普遍邮寄选票的欺诈率更高，个人多次提交投票而未被发现，以另一人的身份投票；这些例子在2020年总统大选期间都很明显。

As part of its Grand Strategy, the Democrat Party and its operatives were successful in pushing for universal mail-in voting in Nevada and Wisconsin. In both of these states, election laws were altered so that mail-in ballots could be sent automatically to every individual on the voter rolls.

作为其宏大战略的一部分，在内华达州和威斯康辛州，民主党及其工作人员成功地推动了全民邮寄投票的实施。这两个州都修改了选举法，使邮寄选票可以自动地发送到选民名册上的每一个人。

For example, on August 3, 2020, Democrat Governor Steve Sisolak (D) in Nevada signed AB-4 legislation into law. It directed election officials to distribute mail-in ballots automatically to all active registered voters for the November 3, 2020, General Election. This bill also gave Sisolak the authority to bypass Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske and command her to adjust election procedures during a declared State of Emergency.

例如，2020年8月3日，内华达州民主党州长史蒂夫·西索拉克（D）将议会4号法案签署为法律。 它指示选举官员为2020年11月3日的大选向所有登记的的活跃选民自动分发邮寄选票。该法案还赋予西索拉克（Sisolak）权力，绕开共和党州务卿巴巴拉·塞格夫斯克（Barbara Cegavske）并命令她在宣布的紧急状态期间修改选举程序。

Note that the CCP virus pandemic again was used to justify this power grab. This alleged “reform” has led to substantial fraud; for example, roughly 15,000 mail-in or absentee ballots were counted in Nevada from voters who had voted in other states.63

值得注意的是CCP病毒大流行再次被用来为这种权力掠夺辩护。这种所谓的“改革”导致了重大欺诈；例如，内华达州统计了大约15,000张邮寄或缺席选票，这些选票来自于已在其他州投过票的选民。

## Legalizing Universal Mailing of Applications for Mail-in/Absentee Ballots

## 使邮寄/缺席选票申请的普遍邮寄合法化

Closely related to the method of sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters is the technique of sending absentee ballot applications to all registered voters. This was done in Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin.

向所有注册选民发送邮寄选票的方法与向所有注册选民发送缺席选票申请的技术密切相关。这些事情发生在乔治亚州，密歇根州和威斯康辛州。

For example, as previously noted, on August 26, 2020, the Michigan Court of Claims ruled that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson had the authority to mail all Michigan registered voters (7.7 million total) absentee ballot applications for the November 3rd election.64

例如，如前所述，2020年8月26日，密歇根州法院裁定，密歇根州州务卿Jocelyn Benson有权向所有密歇根州注册选民（总计770万）邮寄缺席选票申请，以参加11月3日的选举。

Similarly, on June 17, 2020, the Wisconsin Election Commission voted unanimously to send absentee and mail-in ballot applications automatically to 2.7 million registered voters for the November 3, 2020, general election, who had not originally requested mail-in ballots.65

同样，在2020年6月17日，威斯康辛州选举委员会一致投票决定向2020年11月3日大选的270万注册选民发送缺席和邮寄选票申请，即使这些选民原本并未要求邮寄选票。

## Increase Voting by Drop Box

## 通过使用投票箱增加选票

As discussed in Volume 1 of the Navarro Report, the use of ballot drop boxes raises huge chain of custody issues. As a further complicating issue, ballot harvesting, which is illegal in ten states, becomes much easier with the use of drop boxes.

正如《纳瓦罗报告》第1卷中所讨论的那样，使用投票箱引起同了巨大的监管链问题。更为复杂的问题是，由于使用了投票箱，在十个州中都是非法的选票收集变得更加容易。

Perhaps for this reason, prior to the 2020 election season, only thirteen states used ballot drop boxes. In this year’s November General Election, however, that number skyrocketed to thirty-eight states and Washington, D.C.66

也许由于这个原因，在2020年选举季之前，只有13个州使用了投票箱。然而，在今年11月的大选中，这一数字飙升至38个州以及华盛顿特区。

Consider, for example Georgia. Ahead of the 2020 Presidential Primary Election held on June 9, the State Election Board required that “County registrars are authorized to establish one or more drop box locations as a means for absentee by mail electors to deliver their ballots to the county registrars.”67 Drop Boxes were then installed in nineteen of Georgia’s 159 counties.68

以佐治亚州为例。 在6月9日举行的2020年总统初选之前，州选举委员会要求“县登记员有权建立一个或多个投票箱站，作为缺席选举人邮寄选票给县登记员的一种方式。” 随后，佐治亚州159个县有19个安装了投票箱。

Similarly, in Michigan, there appears to have been a conscious effort to stuff the ballot box by stuffing Democrat strongholds with drop boxes. Thirteen new drop boxes were established in Lansing,69 five in Ann Arbor,70 and nearly forty in Detroit,,71 As of the November 3 Election, Michigan had a total of 700 drop-boxes statewide.72

同样，在密歇根州的民主党大本营，似乎有一种有意识地努力，通过大量增加投票箱以达到塞满选票箱的目的。 兰辛新建了13个的投票箱，安娜堡建立了5个，底特律建立了近40个，截至11月3日选举，密歇根州全州共有700个投票箱。

Both Governor Whitmer and Soros puppet Secretary of State Benson issued statements in September 2020 to encourage voters to vote by absentee ballot and submit ballots via drop box in order to “decrease the spread of COVID-19.”73 Here again, we see the Democrats hid behind the shield of the CCP virus to advance their Grand Strategy.

州长惠特默和索罗斯的傀儡州务卿本森都在2020年9月发表声明，鼓励选民以缺席选票方式进行投票，并通过投票箱提交选票，以“减少COVID-19的传播”。 这里，我们再次看到了民主党人利用CCP病毒作为掩护，推进他们的“大战略”。

## Illegal Use of Drop Boxes

## 投票箱的非法使用

In at least some cases, the expanded use of drop boxes was a clear violation of state law.

至少在某些情况下，扩大投票箱的使用范围明是显违反了州选举法。

Consider, for example, Wisconsin. Drop boxes are clearly illegal according to state election law. Yet, the Wisconsin Election Committee nonetheless illegally issued guidance on August 19, 2020, to election officials in all municipalities throughout the state. It designated “drop boxes or mail slots set up for taxes, mail and public utilities as secure ballot drop locations” and suggested “partnering with businesses…such as grocery stores and banks” as places voters could cast their ballots.

以威斯康辛州为例，根据州选举法使用投票箱明显是违法的。然而，威斯康辛州选举委员会仍然在2020年8月19日向全州所有的市政选举官员非法发布了指导意见。该指导设置了“用于税收、邮件和公共设施的投票箱和邮箱作为安全的投票站” 并且建议“与商业合作……例如杂货店和银行”，使其作为选民能够投票的地方。

For example, in Pennsylvania, ahead of the 2020 Presidential Primary, ballot drop boxes were established in violation of state law under Secretary of State Boockvar’s knowledge and consent.

例如，在2020年总统初选前，宾夕法尼亚州在州务卿布克瓦（Boockvar）的知情和认可下，就违法设立了投票箱。

Similar problems arose in Pennsylvania. On June 29, 2020, the Trump Campaign filed a complaint to Secretary of State Boockvar and sixty-seven county officials in Pennsylvania, stating that the Secretary of State established drop boxes illegally by failing to provide adequate security, oversight, and supervision over the drop boxes. These conditions would thereby foster an environment that would encourage the legal ballot harvesting and/or tampering.

类似的问题在宾夕法尼亚州蔓延。2020年6月29日，川普竞选团队向州务卿布克瓦（Boockvar）和全州67个县的官员提起申诉，称州务卿非法设立投票箱，因为没有对投票箱提供足够的安全性、监督和监管。这些条件会因此鼓励合法收集选票和/或者篡改选票的环境。

As indicated in Volume 1 of the Navarro Report, numerous abuses were indeed observed. For example, ballots were illegally dumped into drop boxes at the Nazareth, Pennsylvania, ballot drop box center, in violation of state law. Another witness in Pennsylvania with video and photo evidence caught a man coming out of an unmarked Jeep extracting ballots from an unsupervised ballot drop box to be brought into a ballot counting center.

正如纳瓦罗报告（Navarro Report）第一卷所指出，确实观察到了大量的滥用投票箱的行为。例如在宾夕法尼亚州拿撒勒（Nazareth），选票被非法地放置进投票箱中心的投票箱里，该行为违反了州选举法。另一位在宾夕法尼亚州的证人提供了视频和照片证据，抓住了一个从一辆无标志的吉普车上下来的男人，正从一个无人监管的要送往一个计票中心的投票箱里往外抽取选票。

It’s not just that these drop boxes were illegally deployed. They were disproportionately deployed in urban areas with higher Democrat registration, favoring Joe Biden.

这些投票箱的部署不但违法，而且不成比例地部署在民主党选民多、对拜登有利的城区。

## Ballot Harvesting

## 选票收割

“Ballot harvesting” is the practice of allowing individuals to collect ballots from voters and deliver these bundles of votes to polling stations or drop boxes. Given the obvious chain of custody issues associated ballot harvesting – and the equally obvious opportunities to engage in fake ballot manufacturing – it is no surprise that many states forbid the practice.

“选票收割” 是允许个人从选民手中收取选票并将这些成捆的选票运送到投票站或投票箱的做法。考虑到与选票收割有关的明显的监管问题链 – 和同样明显的制造假选票的机会 – 许多州禁止这种做法就不足为奇了。

These dangers to our democracy notwithstanding, the Democrat Party successfully pushed for the passage of legislation to legalize ballot harvesting in the battleground states of Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin.

尽管这些做法使我们的民主面临危险，民主党仍然成功地推动立法使选票收割在佐治亚州、内华达州和威斯康辛州这几个战场州合法化。

On August 3, 2020, Nevada Democrat Governor Steve Sisolak called a special session with the State Legislature and signed Assembly Bill 4. It legalized the practice of ballot harvesting.

2020年8月3日，内华达州民主党州长史蒂夫·西索拉克(Steve Sisolak)召集州议会召开了特别会议并签署了议会4号法案，这一法案使选票收割的行为合法化。

Bill 4 passed on a party-line vote through both the state Senate and Assembly, with Democrats in favor and all Republicans opposed. Implementation of this bill took place over the strong objections of Nevada Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske who warned that expanded ballot harvesting could fraudulently tip the scales in elections.

州参议院和议会都以党派投票的方式通过了4号法案，民主党支持，共和党全体反对。法案的实施遭到了内华达州共和党州务卿芭芭拉·切格夫斯克(Barbara Cegavske)的强烈反对，她警告扩大选票收割范围会欺诈性的打翻大选的公平性。

In both Georgia and Wisconsin, where ballot harvesting is illegal, Democrat operatives nonetheless pushed the envelope of the law to run ballot harvesting operations. For example, several Democrat non-profits took advantage of the Georgia ballot-curing extension deadline and conducted an absentee ballot-harvesting operation. This operation alone is suspected to have added enough Democrat votes to tip the scales in favor of Joe Biden.

尽管选票收割在佐治亚州和威斯康辛州都是违法的，民主党的工作人员仍然突破法律的极限开展了选票收割的工作。例如，几个民主党的非赢利组织利用佐治亚州延长选票纠正截止日期进行了缺席选票收割的操作。单单这个操作就被怀疑增加有利于拜登的足够多的民主党的选票并打翻了大选的公平性。

To engage in this end run around the law, these organizations called themselves “Ballot Rescue Teams.” They deployed Democrat volunteer activist operatives to call voters and knock on voters’ doors as part of this operation.

为了绕过法律的监管，这些组织自称为“选票救援队” 。他们延伸为民主党的志愿积极分子，给选民打电话或者挨家挨户敲选民的门。

As for Wisconsin, city officials in the Democrat stronghold of Madison assisted in the creation of more than 200 “Democracy in the Park” illegal polling places. These faux polling places were promoted and supported by the Biden campaign. They provided witnesses for absentee ballots and acted in every way like legal polling places—but weren’t. Moreover, they received ballots outside of the limited fourteen-day period preceding an election that is authorized by statute for in-person or absentee balloting. These were all clear violations of state law that had the effect of propagating ballot harvesting.

至于威斯康辛州，民主党的大本营麦迪逊的市政官员帮助创建了200多个“民主在公园”非法投票站。这些假投票站由拜登竞选团队进行宣传和支持。他们为缺席选票提供证人，并且和合法的投票站一样运行 – 但事实并非如此。此外，他们在规定的大选前14天期限外收取选票，根据法律规定这是针对亲自或缺席投票的。这些作法明显都违反了州法律，达到了宣传选票收割的效果。

## Installation of Potentially Corrupt Voting Machines

## 安装潜在舞弊的投票机

Much has been written about how vulnerabilities in voting machine systems may be exploited by cyber hackers and other bad actors to alter the count of actual ballots. A poster child for this problem is the dramatic malfunction that was observed with Dominion Voting Systems in Antrim, Michigan to the detriment of the count for President Trump.

关于投票机系统的漏洞如何被网络黑客和其他坏人利用以改变实际选票的统计方面的文章太多了。这个问题的典型例子是密歇根州安特里姆（Antrim）的多米尼投票系统里出现的戏剧性的故障，这一故障破坏了川普总统的选票计票工作。

In July of 2019, the nonprofit group Fair Fight Action issued a report claiming that another system—Election Securities and Software (ES&S)—has demonstrated “systematic disregard for basic security best practices and a complete lack of competence in the manufacturing of reliable voting machines.” The report also cited “large-scale negligence [that] exposed personal data of millions of voters, left tens of thousands of names off rolls and led to massive delays in vote counts across the country.” Moreover numerous US Senators “have expressed national security concerns after ES&S lied to federal lawmakers, refused to reveal which states were sent critically flawed machines, and vigorously fought attempts to reveal reliability information.

2019年7月，非赢利组织公平斗争行动（Fair Fight Action）发布了一份报告，声称另一个系统 –ES&S – 已经证实“有计划地无视基本安全、最佳实践并且完全不具备生产可靠投票机的能力。”报告还指出“大规模的疏忽泄露了数百万选民的个人数据，造成成千上万的名字从名单上丢失，导致大规模的全国范围内的选票计票的延迟。”此外，很多美国参议员“在ES&S向国会议员说谎，拒绝透露向哪些州提供了有致命缺陷的投票机，并且极力反对披露可靠性信息的企图之后，表达了对国家安全的担忧。”

Despite such concerns and warnings, Dominion and ES&S were implemented in all six battleground states between 2017 and 2020. For example, in March of 2020, Georgia rushed to install 30,000 new electronic voting machines from Dominion. State evaluators warned that these machines were subject to vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, they were installed in all of Georgia’s 159 counties.

尽管有这样的担忧和警告，6个 战场州在2017年和2020年期间全部安装了多米尼投票机和ES&S。例如，在2020年3月，佐治亚州争先恐后地安装了30000台多米尼的新电子投票机。州评估人员警告说这些投票机有致命的漏洞。尽管如此，这种投票机仍然遍布全佐治亚州的159个县。

In 2019, Pennsylvania installed Dominion in fourteen of Pennsylvania’s sixty-seven counties, resulting from guidance issued by the Soros puppet Secretary of State Boockvar. In 2020, 33 counties in Pennsylvania also installed the ES&S system. These counties included the Democrat strongholds of Philadelphia and Montgomery.(Dane and Milwaukee in Wisconsin also use ES&S which were also found to be susceptible to vulnerabilities).

2019年，在索罗斯的傀儡州务卿布克瓦发布的指导意见下，全宾夕法尼亚州67个县中有14个县安装了多米尼投票机。在2020年，又有33个县安装了ES&S系统。这些县包括民主党的大本营费城（Philadelphia）和蒙哥马利（Montgomery）。（威斯康辛州的戴恩县和密尔沃基县也使用了ES&S系统，此系统也被发现有严重的漏洞)。

In March of 2017, the Michigan state government and twenty-two localities likewise awarded Dominion a $31.5 million contract to provide voting machinery statewide. The top-spending local governments included the cities of Detroit ($457,880), Dearborn ($22,975), and Livonia ($65,310) in Democrat-dominated Wayne County.

2017年3月，密歇根州政府和22个地方政府同样给予了多米尼公司一个3.15千万美元，在全州范围内提供投票机的合同。这些支出最高的地方政府包括底特律市（457880美元），迪尔伯恩市（22975美元）和民主党控制的韦恩县的利沃尼亚市（65310美元）。

# Dramatically DECREASE Democrat Ballots Rejected Across Six Battleground States

# 六个战场州被拒的民主党选票大幅度性减少

Even as the Democrat Party sought to dramatically INCREASE the amount of absentee and mail-in ballots, they also sought to dramatically DECREASE the level of scrutiny of such ballots. The practical effect of a reduced level of scrutiny – fewer “election cops” on the beat – was to significantly increase the level of illegal ballots able to FLOOD into the six battleground states.

当民主党试图大幅度增加缺席和邮寄选票数量的时候，他们也试图大幅度减少对这些选票的审查级别。降低审查水平的实际效果是 –辖区 “选举警察” 减少 – 这大大增加了涌入六个战场州的非法选票的数量。

Figure Seven illustrates how the five major gambits used to reduce scrutiny of absentee and mail-in ballots were distributed across the six battleground states. You can see from the figure that the State of Georgia effectively ran the table on behalf of the Democrats – no small irony given the fact that Georgia has both as useful idiots, both a Republican governor and a Republican Secretary of State.

表七陈述了五大主要用于降低对分布在六个战场州的缺席和邮寄选票的审查的策略。从表中可以看出，佐治亚州有效地代表了民主党来施政 – 这真是一个不小的讽刺，因为佐治亚州共和党的州长及共和党的州务卿，都是可利用的白痴。

In studying this figure, it is important to note that all methods of reducing ballot scrutiny are not created equal. One of the most critical elements of a free and fair election is the transparency one gains through comprehensive poll watching and observing. While both Pennsylvania and Michigan are characterized by only this method of reduced scrutiny, this method alone affected hundreds of thousands of potentially illegal votes in both states.

研究此表时，重要的是要注意到，减少选票审查各种方法的使用并不均等。自由和公正选举的最关键要素之一是通过全面的投票监察获得透明度。宾夕法尼亚州和密西根州都只采用了这种减少审查的方法，但仅此方法就影响了两个州潜在的数十万的非法选票。

## Relaxed ID Verification Requirements

## 放宽身份验证要求

The Democratic push for lower voter identification requirements most notably occurred in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin.

民主党大力推动降低选民身份识别要求的情况主要发生在亚利桑那州、佐治亚州、内华达州和威斯康辛州。

For example, behind the shield of the CCP virus, Democrat stronghold counties in Arizona like Maricopa and Pima allowed and encouraged residents of long-term care facilities to vote by video chat.96 There is no way to verify voter identification by video call, and there is no oversight over special election boards to know, in fact, if ballots are being recorded accurately.97

例如，在CCP病毒的掩护下，民主党在亚利桑那州的大本营县，如马里科帕（Maricopa）和皮马（Pima）允许并鼓励长期护理机构的居民通过视频聊天投票。通过视频电话根本无法核实选民的身份，而且事实上，没有监督特别选举委员会了解选票是否被准确记录。

Similarly, as noted earlier, Wisconsin’s Democrat-dominated Dane and Milwaukee counties allowed anyone to register as “indefinitely confined.98 These Wisconsin votes were thereby tabulated without verifying photo ID.99

同样，如前所述，威斯康辛州民主党控制的丹恩县和密尔沃基县允许任何人以 “无限期限制 “的方式登记。这些威斯康辛州的选票点数时无需审核带照片的身份证件。

## Relaxed Signature-Match Requirements

## 放宽签字-匹配要求

A major way mail-in and absentee ballots can be verified is through a process called signature matching. All states require voters to provide signatures on their absentee and mail-in ballot return documents in order to verify identification.100

核实邮寄和缺席选票的一个主要方法是通过一个称为签名匹配的程序。所有州都要求选民在缺席和邮寄的选票回执文件上签名，以核实身分。

Note that thirty-two states in the U.S. require election workers to match voter signature with a signature on record for the voter on their registration form.101 In this case, Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada all relaxed signature match requirements, bringing into question hundreds of thousands potentially illegal ballots.

请注意，美国的三十二个州要求选举工作人员将选民签名与注册登记表上记录的签名相匹配。在这种情况下，亚利桑那州，佐治亚州和内华达州均放宽了签名匹配要求，使数十万张可能存在的非法选票受到质疑。

Perhaps most egregiously, on March 6th of 2020, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, with the approval of Governor Brian Kemp, signed off on a secret legal agreement with the Democratic Party of Georgia, the Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to significantly alter absentee ballot procedures in Georgia.102 The Democrats’ attorney for this secret deal was alleged Russia Hoax operative Marc Elias from Perkins Coie.103

或许更令人震惊的是，2020年3月6日，佐治亚州州务卿布拉德·拉芬斯伯格（Brad Raffensperger）在州长布莱恩·坎普（Brian Kemp）的批准下，与佐治亚州民主党、民主党参议员竞选委员会和民主党国会竞选委员会签署了秘密法律协议，大幅改变了佐治亚州的缺席投票程序。民主党这一秘密协议的律师据称是来自珀金斯-科伊公司的俄罗斯骗局特工马克·埃利亚斯（Marc Elias）。

Originally, the signature-matching requirement in Georgia was such that the signature on the mail-in envelope had to match both the voter’s signature stored in the State’s E-Net system, as well as the absentee ballot application. The new guidance loosened these requirements; it only required that the signature on the absentee (mail-in) ballot envelope either must match the eNet signature, or the absentee ballot application, rather than both. 104 Further, the State required that if the election worker found a signature to not match, it couldn’t be rejected unless a majority of the registrars, deputy registrars, or absentee ballot clerks reviewing the signature agreed.105

最初，佐治亚州的签名匹配要求是，邮寄信封上的签名必须与存储在州电子网络系统中的选民签名以及缺席选票申请上的签名相匹配。新的指引放宽了这些要求；它只要求缺席(邮寄)选票信封上的签名必须与电子网络签名或缺席选票申请表上的签名相吻合，而不是两者都吻合。 此外，这个州还规定，如果选举工作人员发现签名不匹配，除非大多数审查签名的登记员、副登记员或缺席选票办事员同意，否则不能拒绝该签名。

This wholesale gutting of the state’s signature-match requirement resulted in a drastic reduction in Georgia’s absentee ballot rejection rate from 6.8% in 2016, to 0.34% during the 2020 Presidential Election. Effectively, almost none of Georgia’s 1.3 million absentee ballots were rejected.106 On top of this, Georgians were given the opportunity to “cure” or “fix” their ballot signatures on ballots incorrectly filled out for three days after November 3 (Election Day).107 If the flood of absentee ballots in the 2020 election had been rejected at the same rate as in the 2016 election, that would have been enough alone to flip the election to President Trump.

对州签名匹配要求的全面改动，导致佐治亚州的缺席投票拒绝率从2016年的6.8％大幅降低至2020年总统大选期间的0.34％。实际上，佐治亚州130万张缺席选票中几乎没有一张被拒绝。除此之外，佐治亚州人还有机会在11月3日(选举日)之后的三天时间里 “纠正 “或 “修正 “他们在选票上错误填写的签名，如果2020年大选中大量缺席选票被拒绝的比例与2016年大选相同，那么仅此一项就足以让大选翻盘给川普总统。

A similarly egregious problem reared its Grand Strategy head in Nevada. New legislation passed in August of 2020108 allowed voters over sixty-five who have a disability or are unable to read or write to have someone assist them in physically marking signatures on their ballots.109 These relaxed rules thereby have called into question at least some of the 400,000 ballots cast by Nevadans aged 65 and older. This “reform” also likely contributed to the statewide absentee ballot rejection rate dropping from 1.6% in 2016 to 0.58% in 2020. 110

在内华达州也出现了类似的严重问题。2020年8月通过的新立法允许六十五岁以上有残疾或无法读写的选民，由他人协助在他们的选票上实际标记签名.这些放宽的规定使内华达州65岁及以上的选民所投的40万张选票中，至少有一部分受到质疑。这项 “改进 “也极有可能使全州缺席选票的拒绝率从2016年的1.6%下降到2020年的0.58%。

## Illegal Counting of Naked Ballots 

## 裸票的非法计算

A quick review of the Figure Seven above indicates that the State of Georgia effectively cornered the market on the illegal counting of naked ballots. This was part of the bitter fruit of the aforementioned Georgia Consent Decree.

对上面图7的速览指出佐治亚州实际上垄断了非法计算裸票的市场。这就是上述**佐治亚州同意令**的苦果的一部分。

## Increased Opportunities for Ballot Curing 

## 增加选票纠正的机会

As a fourth method to DECREASE the scrutiny of absentee and mail-in ballots, Democrats pushed for ballot curing leniency, which increased the ability or timeframe for curing problematic ballots. Ultimately, this effort allowed for illegally submitted mail-in or absentee ballots to be counted.

作为**降低**缺席选票和邮寄选票的审查力度的第四个方法，民主党人推动在投票纠正方面保持宽大处理，这使得增大了对有问题选票纠正的强度，并延长了时限长度。他们的努力最终还是将非法提交的邮寄选票和缺席选票纳入了计算中。

For example, on September 10, 2020, Obama-appointed Judge Douglas Rayes of the U.S. District Court for Arizona ordered election officials to give voters five business days after Election Day to sign their vote-by-mail ballot envelopes. Voters had until 5 PM on November 10 to sign the envelopes even if they failed to sign at the time they submitted the ballots.111

比方说，在2020年9月10日，奥巴马任命的法官道格拉斯·雷斯（Douglas Rayes），作为亚利桑那州地区法院的雷斯法官要求选举官员在选举日后的5个工作日内让选民签署邮寄选票的信封。选民必须在11月10日下午5点之前签署信封，即使他们在提交选票时没有签署。

In the wake of this order, Democrat volunteers raced around the state texting, calling, and knocking on people’s doors112 to make sure thousands of ballots would be cured.113 Without the ruling, such votes would otherwise have been deemed illegal.

命令下达后，民主党志愿者们在各州内迅速忙着发短信、打电话、上门沟通来确保成千上万张选票能够得到纠正。要是没有裁决的话，这些选票将被视为非法。

Perhaps most egregiously, the Wisconsin Election Commission unanimously offered guidance114 for vote curing, notably in contradiction of Wisconsin Statutes 6.84 and 6.86. For example, the Wisconsin Election Commission instructed curing mail-in ballots with missing addresses.115 This was despite Wisconsin Election Law plainly stating: “If a certificate is missing the address of a witness, the ballot may not be counted.”116 (Nevadans were also given a ballot-curing extension for up to a week after Election Day.)117

也许最令人震惊的是，威斯康辛州选举委员会一致为选票矫正提供了指导方略，这很显然违反了威斯康辛州法规6.84和6.86条。例如，威斯康辛州选举委员会指导那些地址缺失的邮寄选票的纠正。尽管《威斯康辛州选举法》明确指出：“如果遗失了证人的地址，那么选票不得计算在内。”（内华达州人民还获准在选举日之后延长长达一周的选票纠正。）

## Reduced Poll Watching/Observing 

## 减少投票监察

Democrat Party officials and operatives repeatedly sought to reduce the meaningful access of Republican poll watchers and observers during the ballot counting process in half of the battleground states. At the same time, these officials and operatives also sought to reduce the actual number of poll watchers and observers, often behind the shield of the CCP virus.

民主党官员及其工作人员一再试图将共和党投票监察员在多达一半战场州的计票过程中减少他们有效地监察途径。与此同时，这些官员及其工作人员通常以CCP病毒为借口，试图减少投票监察员的实际人数。

For example, Act 12 was passed by the Pennsylvania State Legislature on March 27, 2020. It mandated a reduction in the amount of poll workers.118 Also in Pennsylvania, certified Republican poll watchers were not allowed within six feet of ballot counters, and even kept at distances between 50 and 100 feet.119 Despite the disenfranchisement of observers and legal voters, counties like Philadelphia asserted that these restrictions had to go into effect due to pandemic social- distancing guidelines.120 Such limitations would remain in place until a Pennsylvania Court Ruling went into effect on November 5, after hundreds of thousands of ballots had already been processed.121

比方说，宾夕法尼亚州议会于2020年3月27日通过了第12号法案。该法案规定减少投票站工作人员的数目。同样在宾夕法尼亚州，已经认证的共和党投票监察员不得在投票台的6英尺范围内，甚至被要求保持在50到100英尺之间的距离。尽管观察员和合法选民被剥夺了权利，但诸如像费城这样的县仍声称，由于大流行病的社交距离规范准则，这些限制必须生效。这种限制将会一直存在，直到11月5日宾夕法尼亚州法院的一项裁决生效，并在数十万张选票处理完毕后。

Michigan, likewise, was a hotbed poll watcher and observer abuses designed to reduce the scrutiny of potentially illegal absentee and mail-in ballots. For example, Republican poll workers were kept more than six feet from ballot counters, sometimes, on entirely separate floors.122 Like in Pennsylvania, this flagrant denial of ballot observation was justified under CCP pandemic guidelines.

同样，密歇根州是滋生投票监察员职权滥用的战场州，旨在减少对潜在非法缺席选票和非法邮寄选票的审查。例如，共和党投票站的工作人员离投票台有六英尺之多，有时候完全分开在不同的楼层。就像宾夕法尼亚州一样，根据CCP疫情的指导准则，这种公然拒绝选票监察居然是合理的。

The practical effect of the Democrat Party’s *Art of the Steal*was to substantially increase the number of potentially illegal ballots across all six battleground states. The equally practical result of the *Art of the Steal*was to effectively tip the balance of the election through the strategic gaming of the electoral process. While much of what the Democrats did was not *per se*illegal, what they did enabled illegal activity, namely, stuffing the ballot box with illegal mail-in and absentee ballots.

民主党的盗窃艺术的实际效果是大幅增加所有六个战场州中潜在非法选票的数量。盗窃艺术同样实际的结果就是通过在战略上玩弄了选举过程来达到扭转局势的效果。虽然民主党大部分所做的行为本身并不违法，但是他们的所作所为却助长了非法活动，即用非法的邮寄选票和非法的缺席选票来塞满选票箱。

## Concluding Observations 

## 结论观察

By implementing its Grand “Stuff the Ballot Box” Strategy, the Democrat Party and its political operatives have strategically gamed one of the most sacred elements of American democracy, our election system. This was brass knuckle politics at the highest level which has delivered a brutal punch to the nose of the American people and a vicious kick to the groin of American democracy.

通过实施其填塞选票箱”大战略，民主党及其政治执行者从战略上玩弄了美国民主中最神圣的基石之一，即我们的选举系统。最高层政治人物挥舞着戴上指节铜环的拳头狠狠地朝美国人民的鼻子上痛击，不仅如此还给美国民主的“腹股沟”上凶狠地踢上一脚。

That the Democrat Party and its operatives have, up to this point, gotten away with their Immaculate Deception and Art of the Steal represents a signal failure of the media, Republican state legislators, and other Republican government officials across the battleground states, the US Congress, and our judicial branch of government at both the state and federal levels.

民主党及其政治执行者到目前为止已经侥幸摆脱了他们完美骗局和盗窃艺术之名，这表明媒体、共和党州立法者和其他共和党政府官员在各战场州、美国国会以及我们在州、联邦各级政府的司法部门都是一个显著的失败。

Volumes 1 and 2 of the Navarro Report – *The Immaculate Deception*and *The Art of the Steal*– together make the strong case for a full investigation of the election irregularities and strategic gaming of our political process that in all likelihood have led to a stolen presidential election. Any such investigation must begin immediately as this nation simply cannot risk the inauguration of a president who will be perceived by a large segment of the American people as illegitimate.

《纳瓦罗报告》第一卷和第二卷——“完美欺骗”和“盗窃艺术”共同为全面调查选举违规行为和战略意义上玩弄选举过程提供了有力的依据，那就是这很有可能致使了一场被盗窃的总统选举。任何此类调查都必须立即开始，因为这个国家根本不能冒险让一位被许多美国人视为非法的总统就职。
