新闻简述：郭文贵先生在2021年1月9日的GTV盖特视频中，透露中共北京政权知道世界和美国人民一定会跟它算病毒的总账，所以已如惊弓之鸟，把防范“斩首行动”列为最高军事要务。郭先生还用越王勾践的故事提醒大家，带来最后胜利的关键因素可能是愚蠢的敌人自己。

**中英文对照全文**

I think this is the greatest gift to our Witshleblower Movement from the heavens. Who do you feel people in the world and American people are thinking of at this moment? Who do they hate the most? Who are they angry at the most? Do you think the virus will just disappear? Do you think the CCP can be let off easy?

我认为这是上天送给我们爆料革命最大的礼物。大家觉得这个时候，全世界和美国人民，最想的是谁？最恨的是谁？最生谁的气？大家觉得这病毒就没了吗？大家觉得现在共产党就没事了吗？

I heard that the Beijing regime has now put the anti-decapitation strike as its highest priority. Its internal security guards now have more shifts each day, from the previous 12 shifts to the current 24 shifts – one shift per hour. It has reached this level [of security]!

听说北京现在防“斩首行动”袭击列为第一级别，内部现在已经每天都所谓的换防，一天换好几次，从过去的12班，已经换成了现在24班，一小时一班，这已经到了这个程度了！

Think about China’s food shortage and its “rolling pin” [fake] economy. Can it [the fake economy] become real? Can the US print a lot of money now? There are too many things to talk about, but I just don’t want to. About the [social] media, do you think American people would let it go after so many accounts were suspended by them? Whoever’s account was suspended by the media, they will definitely be the winners in the future.

中国的缺粮食还有擀面杖子经济，就变成真的了吗？美国现在就可以大量的印钞票了吗？太多了，我就不想多说了。还有这媒体，这媒体关掉以后，美国人就拉倒了？谁的媒体被关掉，未来这个被关掉者一定是赢家。

At this moment, my dear brothers and sisters in arms, we are not competing for our persistence, not our courages, not your righteousness, then what are we competing for? At this crucial moment, fellow fighters, let’s learn from the king of the Yue Kingdom, Gou Jian. Anyone who understands the historical story of King Gou Jian should still remember what led to Gou Jian’s final victory. Was it due to the 500 prodigies? The handful of Ministers around him? Was it Fan Li? Was it due to his sacrifices and persistence? None of them. It was because of its opponent, Bo Pi, a fatuous king of the Wu Kingdom, together with his wrong decisions that led him to death. Otherwise, it [the victory of Gou Jian] would be impossible.

这个时候，亲爱的兄弟姐妹们，拼的不是耐力，拼的也不是勇气，拼的也不是你的正义，拼的是什么？战友们现在？最关键的时候，学学越王勾践。任何懂得越王勾践这个历史故事[1]的人都记住，越王勾践最后赢在了哪里？在那500个神童吗？是他身边的几个大臣吗？是范蠡吗？是他牺牲了的耐力吗？都不是。是对方，是伯嚭，是真正的吴王的昏君，还有他错误的决定，走向了黄泉路，否则不可能的。

[What will destroy the CCP are] the CCP’s internal struggles, it’s non-curable cancers in its economy and politics, the 1.4 billion people’s open mouths waiting for food and never ending, unsolvable resentment, and the most vicious virus in this world.

现在共产党的内乱，和共产党内部的永远无法治愈的经济癌症、政治癌症和整个14亿人民张着嘴要吃饭的这种永远填不满的这种怨恨，解决不了的怨恨，还有世界上最可怕的病毒。
