## 中共一切都是假的！“中南坑”领导的身体状况是国家机密！
` Isaiah4031` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/698087/)

新闻简述：郭先生在2020年12月28日早上发布的GTV盖特视频中，对比普通人和独裁者对生病和健康状况的态度，并用著名影视剧《甄嬛传》和《斯大林之死》暗喻当今中共独裁者（习近平），有可能像这影视作品中描述的结局一样，死于“自己人”手上。中共的本质在于：一切都是假的，所以人民不能妄议朝纲，不能妄议“中南坑”领导的身体状况，不能妄议疫情死多少人，不能妄议中美关系，也不能妄议“爆料革命”。

How are you, my honorable brothers and sisters in arms! Today is December 28th. I will not work out today, and therefore today is a comfortable, cheat day. However, I was on the terrace last night, answering and making phone calls, and caught a little cold. I haven’t caught a cold for a year. I think having a small cold is good, and a little runny nose helps expel toxins in your body.

尊敬的战友们好！12月28号，文贵今天不健身，所以说的今天挺舒服啊休息一天。但是昨天晚上一直在露台接电话，打电话，所以有点感冒，一年了没感冒了，我觉得感冒感冒挺好，流流鼻涕排排毒。

We are not long live or long long live emperors, right? To ordinary people, getting sick or catching a little cold is a good thing, which can help eliminate toxins in your body. Yes, usually “saints” cannot get sick easily, but once a “saint” gets sick, it is usually something really serious, and the saint might be killed by the poison mixed in the medicine or in soup, or being strangled by a yellow rope, just as what was described in the Chinese TV series *Empresses in the Palace*. Have you ever watched the movie *The Death of Stalin*? I have recommended it several times. The Death of Stalin is a wonderful movie.

咱们也不是什么万岁万岁万万岁，是吧，常人嘛，普通人有点病，感冒一下挺好，排排毒嘛。就是啊一般的圣人不得病的。不过圣人一得病就得大病，一般都是《甄嬛传》里面给下点药啊弄点毒啊，煲汤给煲出毒那种的 ，或者拿黄绳子给勒死那种。看过斯大林那个电影了吗？我一再推荐，斯大林之死那个电影真是拍得太好了。

So the CCP is completely done, with its economy being collapsed! According to what a fellow fighter told me yesterday, now for the statistical data, the Bureau of Statistics in China have implemented the “three points and five cuts” policy internally. That is to say the director who is in charge of the data and the one who is in charge of the report cannot communicate with each other, for there is the concern that anyone who knows all of the data or reports will expose it. Things like this have happened since the Cultural Revolution, that is to promote distrust, suspicion and surveillance among each another.

所以共产党是彻底的完了、经济的崩塌！据昨天有战友跟我说，现在统计局所有的统计数据，在内部已经实行了“三分五割”的制度，也就是说主管数据的或主管报表的局长，是相互不能打听的，就担心你哪个人知道了，你全部给爆料出去。这事儿”文化大革命“时候就开始了，就是互相猜忌，互相监督。

Another thing is its food crisis, which has become a national security issue and a national secret! Like the [CCP] virus, the mortality rate is a secret of national security. How terrible you think it is, my brothers and sisters! Then, it is said that the mortality rate is a national secret, and the amount of grain in stock is also a national secret!

另外一个就是现在粮食[危机]，粮食成了国家的安全和机密！像现在这个病毒一样，死亡数是国家安全的机密，你说多恐怖，兄弟姐妹们！然后，现在说，死亡率是机密；粮食有多少，也是机密！

What is more ironic, dear brothers and sisters, is that I heard a very ridiculous story yesterday. It’s said that the leadership of a province in China posted a temporary notice on the door when holding a meeting, listing questions that cannot be asked during the meeting and topics that cannot be talked about. Haha, “topics that cannot be asked or talked about” in the Provincial Party Committee, posted on the door of the Provincial Party Secretary’s meeting! Absolutely, you cannot discuss disrespectfully about anything concerning the governance of the party or anything concerning the health condition of the central leaderships in the Zhongnan Pit, right? You cannot argue how many people have died, you cannot discuss the relationship between China and the U.S., and you cannot talk about the Whistleblower Movement!

更夸张的事情，亲爱的兄弟姐妹们，昨天我听到个特别搞笑的事情，说某省在开会的时候，领导在门口临时贴出一张[纸]：会议当中不能问的问题，不能谈到的话题。呵呵，“不能问的、不能谈到的话题”，是在省委啊，省委书记的会上的门上贴上的！绝对那是不能妄议朝纲，不能妄议“中南坑”领导的身体状况，是吧？也不能妄议现在死多少人，也不能妄议中美关系，也不能妄议“爆料革命”！

Brothers and sisters, therefore, all of you know that the current situation in Mainland China is: everything is fake! Everything is fake!

兄弟姐妹，所以说，现在国内这个情况，大家知道：一切都是假的！一切都是假的！
