**中英文对照全文**

It’s about the video of General Hu Chen from a couple of days ago. General Hu Chen’s family is our fellow fighter, that’s what I can tell you, who is also one of the “chairs” [GTV investors].

头两天那个视频，陈虎将军，陈虎将军的家人是我们的战友，我先给说到这，也是我们其中一把椅子。

Hu Chen was first arranged to go to a certain country’s embassy, including meeting the military attaché in the embassy. Everything had been arranged well, but he lost his life in the last minute due to his money, the money he hided. To the Whistleblower Movement, he was not the real kind of fellow fighter, to be honest, even though his child is. The document he gave to us was not everything because he wanted to keep something for himself, more than one thing I would say.

陈虎最早被安排去某国大使馆，包括跟大使馆的武官都见过面的，都安排好了。但是陈虎在最后的一分钟，因钱失命，他就是藏了一些钱。爆料革命吧，他对爆料革命还不是那种真实的战友，说白了，虽然他的孩子是。他给的资料并没有完全给我们，他还想留一手，还想跟我们也留一手，留多手吧可以说。

Then he tried to move his money, gold, and art out of China. He was also making his after-life plans, which caused him to delay his escape to the embassy. As a result, the CCP caught him the last minute before he went to the embassy. He was killed from injected toxin in the end. Therefore, Hu Chen did not die from heart diseases, rather he was killed from injected toxin. This is how the CCP deals with its so-called “anti-state crime”, injecting with toxin or blowing their heads with bullets. Based on what I heard, the injection was done in front of everybody, rather than secretly.

然后他在国内的一些钱呀，金砖金条字画的他还往外捣腾。还安排所谓的后事，延迟了一星期到大使馆去，结果就被共产党就给叼住了。最后共产党在他去大使馆之前，把他给摁住了，最后是注射毒针给弄死了。所以陈虎不是心脏病死，是注射毒针死。这共产党对付所谓叛国罪的，毒针和直接枪毙开瓢。而且注射毒针据说是当着他的所有人的面注射毒针的，而且不是所谓的祕密执行。

Hu Chen was among the first who disclosed information to the Whistleblower Movement about Jiang [Zemin]’s family and the Malaysia Airlines [Flight 370]. If he were able to escape successfully, he would be exposing all the truth about the Malaysia Airlines to America and the West, and also about the organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners and inmates in prisons. But what’s more important would be *Plan 13579*.

陈虎是最早向爆料革命说出江家和马航事件的其中人之一。他当时如果成功的逃出来，他就会向美国西方揭露所有马航的真实事件。还有一个，真正的就是法轮功[学员]被换器官的、还有劳改犯被换器官，更重要的事情是13579计划。

What can we say? He lost his life to money. So when a human being is facing money… a man needs to deal with three things: how to not fall from your genital, from money or from the so-called reputation, and that’s it. His story has just begun, has just begun, and it’s not as simple as you think.

但是呢没办法，他因财又失命。所以这个人在这个钱面前，所以人解决人的问题，就三件事，如何你不倒在生殖器上？如何不倒在钱上？还有第三个不倒在所谓的名义上？就这麽点事。他的故事还刚刚开始…刚刚开始…绝不是大家想像的那麽简单。
