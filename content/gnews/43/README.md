简述：郭先生在2021年3月19日的盖特视频中指出中共妄图用美国种族问题说事，为自己在新疆、香港等地的大屠杀洗地。他告诉美国朋友，中共的任何一次大屠杀的杀死的人的零头，都是美国历史上200多年的总和。



**中共杀人无数****  ****没有权利指责美国种族问题**

**CCP Has Committed Numerous Massacres and Has No Right to Accuse the US of the Race Problem**

大概情况吧，就是中共这回来打的招儿叫种族歧视、种族大屠杀，就是美国你杀黑人。我就回答所有的这些欧洲的、美国的，说你怎么看这问题，我们该怎么办？很多人问。我说，很简单，你说共产党在西藏杀的人，新疆杀的人，还有杀的我们汉人、自己人、香港人，还有50几个其他民族，包括云南那几个小民族，像当年的水傣、汉傣。大家没有查过历史吧，在大理下关水傣和汉傣，那杀了多少人，我说他杀的任何一次零头，都是你美国历史上这200多年的总和。他没有任何资格指责你所谓的种族问题。

Basically the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s countermeasure this time is called racial discrimination and genocide. They argued that you, the US killed black people. So, I answered all the European and American people who have asked the questions: “What’s your take on this? What do we do?” I said it’s very simple. You should say that the CCP killed people in Tibet, Xinjiang, and also Han, their own people, Hong Kong people, and people of more than 50 other ethnic groups, including a few small ethnic groups in Yunnan such as Shui Dai and Han Dai. People may have not checked this history. They [the CCP] have killed many people in Xiaguan Shui Dai and Han Dai in Dali. I said that the total number of people killed during America’s 200 years’ history is only a fraction of any single genocide they have committed. So they have no right to accuse you of the so-called race problem.

美国历史上绝对有这个问题，我说但是中共正在扼杀，正在屠杀。而且此时此刻正在屠杀。这就是我说你们美国人要明白，共产党跟你玩的是你内部搞的种族大屠杀。我建议你们好好看一看印度的电影《白虎》，这是共产党真实的，向世界搞文化大革命，文化大革命输出，搞种族大革命，种族大革命输出，种族仇恨。然后最重要的是把世界上所有的问题，历史的全归你白人。我说打你们的所有的朱利安尼，打你川普，打你班农，打你美国所有的右派和极右派，打你共和党，所有的一招儿，你就是种族歧视。我说你的种族歧视和种族大屠杀，觉得实在差太远了，是你们有机会的时候了。

“Of course this problem existed in American history,” I said, “but the CCP is committing mass killing, a massacre at this very moment.” I continued, “You Americans should understand that the CCP is playing you with the game called “internal racial genocide”. I suggest you all to take a good look at the Indian movie, named ‘White Tiger’. This is the CCP’s real plan – exporting and carrying out a Cultural Revolution in the world, exporting and carrying out a racial revolution, racial hatred, and most importantly, blaming you white people for all the world’s present and historical problems. I said, they use the same trick to beat every one of you, including Giuliani, Trump, Bannon, all the right-wing and far-right people in the US, and the republicans, blaming them for racial discrimination. I said, “Your racial discrimination and their genocide are totally not comparable, so this is your opportunity.”

“哎呀。”很多人说：“对呀，有道理。”我说是你们该反击的时候了，到底是种族歧视存不存在？到底种族大屠杀这俩之间是什么关系？哪个重要？关键问题你现在还在干，我说这就让全世界来调查调查吧，让把全世界来评评理吧，我说你干嘛不利用这次机会啊？

Many people said, “Yes, it makes sense.” I said, “It’s time for you [Americans] to fight back. Does racial discrimination really exist or not? What is its relationship with the [CCP’s] genocide? Which one is more serious? The key is that the CCP is still committing the crime at this moment.” I continued, “Let the whole world conduct an investigation, and let the whole world be the judge. Why don’t you take advantage of this opportunity?”

我说这个杨洁篪还有王毅，他俩都想争下一个常委，都想管外交常委，杨洁篪要退，王毅要上，他俩拼命地表现胳膊硬，擀面杖子硬，是吧？我说你让他表演吗，但你要借着这个表演，你要让全世界知道共产党杀了多少西藏人，杀了多少新疆人，杀了多少其他的水傣、汉傣，还有彝族人，杀了多少人。为什么那50几个民族越来越少，甚至是消失了，慢慢都杀掉了，都用各种所谓的政策，看上去美好的政策，把这种族都给灭了。

I said, “Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi both want to compete for the next slot for the Member of the Standing Committee and be in charge of foreign affairs in the Standing Committee. Yang Jiechi is retiring, and Wang Yi wants to go up. They both acted desperately to show that their arms are stronger and their rolling pin is harder than the other person, right?” I said, “you should let them keep acting, but you have to use this opportunity to let the world know how many Tibetans, Xinjiang people, Shui Dai and Han Dai people, and Nuosuo people that the CCP has killed. Why is the 50 ethnic groups’ population diminishing, even disappearing? Because they are killed gradually and eliminated by those seemly “good” policies [of the CCP’s].”

更重要的事情，在香港现在，他在大屠杀，汉人是不是少数民族？汉人还是大族民族，杀少数民族你当然是大罪，杀汉族难道就不是罪吗？杀人都是罪。是吧？某CNN主持人，是吧？通过各方面的紧急联系，问我啥看法？你说我有啥看法，我就这么几个看法。郭文贵就是个小人物，狗屁不是，是不是？郭三秒、郭骗子、郭强奸、郭没钱，是吧？就这点儿吧？

“More importantly, they have a massacre in Hong Kong right now. Are the Han people an ethnic minority? No, the Han ethnic group is a big ethnic group. Of course, killing ethnic minorities is a huge crime, but isn’t killing the Han people a crime too? Any murder is a crime, right? A certain CNN host urgently contacted me through every channel, asking what my opinion is on this. What opinions can I have? I am nobody, and I have only some very small opinions which are nothing, right? I am the “Guo three second”, “Guo Liar”, “Guo Rapist”, and “Guo penniless”, ain’t I? That’s it.

所以兄弟姐妹们，我告诉过大家，共产党一出手，都是对咱帮助，为什么？因为他的出发点全是内部政治斗争，是上海帮和习大神的斗争。你去看这两个坐在那的时候，看上去执行的都是你中央的命令，事实上都想的是明年谁来接着继续干，杨洁篪继续干，还是王毅上来，当所谓的管外交的委员。共产党一撅啥屁股，就知道它拉什么屎，啥心都不行。中国人死人，死一百万，一千万，一个亿，对他来讲，那简直是太小事了。

So brothers and sisters, let me tell you. Any move of the CCP will only help us. Why? Because their goal is all about internal political struggles, the struggles between the Shanghai Gang and the Great Xi God. So, when you see these two people (Wang and Yang) sitting there [during the meeting in Alaska], who seemed to be executing the orders of their central government, you should know that they were actually thinking about who could go up next, whether Yang Jiechi will continue to work, or Wang Yi will go up to become the so-called commissioner in charge of foreign affairs. So, [just like a dog] once the CCP moves its butt, you would know it’s going to shit. To them, it is such a trivial thing for the Chinese to die, no matter if it is one million, 10 million, or 100 million.

你让王毅明天来接杨洁篪，管外交的委员，甚至进常委，中国死一半他都不在乎，这就是共产党的邪恶，没有一个人想中国人跟那他一样的。他认为中国人都是贱民、下等人、中下等人，他是上等人，上等人。这是每个进了中南坑所谓当了中央候补委员，到中央委员到政治局常委，每个人的心理。信不信，你自己看着办吧。我接触的中央，不管任何人只要到了上面这个层次以后，不管他保持什么样的生活形式，内心的世界的变化都有这样的，他认为他有…甚至是神，甚至是菩萨，甚至佛祖的代言人，甚至是化身。然后中国老百姓，其他人都是下等人、中等人。这就是真正的中国现在的状态，没有这个国家、这个民族现在在扯淡的。他说的是一切话，做的一切事，都是为了他自己，中间这一块，然后还有嘴上这一块，啥都是扯蛋。所以说到这儿，咱就不讲了，看着吧，接下来的热闹大了！

If you ask Wang Yi to replace Yang Jiechi tomorrow to become the committee member in charge of foreign affairs, and even the member of the Standing Committee, he wouldn’t care if half of Chinese people will die or not. This is the evilness of the CCP. None of them think that ordinary Chinese people are their equals. He believes that Chinese people are all pariahs, inferiors, or the middle class at most, but he himself is superior. Everyone who has entered the Zhongnan Pit and become the so-called alternate member of the Central Committee, the member of the Central Committee, or the Standing Committee of the Politburo, thinks like this, believe it or not. You can figure it out by yourself. Among those whom I have contacted with, whenever a person has reached to a level high enough, no matter what kind of life style he still maintains, he must have experienced this kind of psychological change. He would think he is now a god, a Bodhisattva, and even the spokesperson of the Buddha or its incarnation, and believe that the other Chinese people are inferior or just middle-class. This is the true state of China now. They claim that what they are doing is for the country and the nation. It is all nonsense. What they do and what they say are all for themselves. Everything that they said is nonsense. So I’ll stop here on this. Let’s see what will happen, it will be fun to watch.
