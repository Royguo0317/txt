**中共金融系统崩溃一触即发****  ****所有灾难都会推到****14****亿****“****奴隶****”****身上**

**CCP’s Economy Is Collapsing, 1.4B Slaves Will Bear the Consequences**

就是目前共产党在国内这种经济内部所有的问题积累到房地产市场的时候，还有最终所有的问题都在金融系统爆发的时候，大家一定要记住：共产党一定到最后把金融崩溃、房地产崩溃所有的这些最灾难的东西全推到14亿“奴隶”身上。

At this moment when all the problems of the CCP’s domestic economy accumulate in the real estate market, and finally when all the problems erupt in the financial system, everyone must remember this: in the end, the CCP will definitely let the 1.4 billion “slaves” bear the most catastrophic consequences of the financial and real estate crashes.

为什么这么说？昨天，就「前面提到的」那位朋友告诉我说他的家族银行最近受到最多的是国内过去打交道的国有企业的这些人介绍关系大额存款，包括和他商量购买黄金，在海外存放的事情，甚至有些人跟他商量拥有的一些美国大的公司像特斯拉，苹果，这些大公司的股票能否让他的银行代持？

Why do I say that? Yesterday, the friend that I mentioned earlier told me that his family bank recently received many referrals from acquaintances he had dealt with in the past in state-owned enterprises in China. These people want to make large deposits in his bank, including negotiating with him to buy gold and deposit them overseas. In fact, some people who own stocks of large American companies such as Tesla and Apple even discussed with him to see if his bank could hold their stocks of these companies.

种种现象都说明共产党内部对共产党员的每个人的个人家人的资产查清、查处和没收正在准备着，「所以」内部人有知道的就要想一切办法把东西弄到外面儿去。同时也证明了共产党非常清楚：中国的金融要崩盘！在崩盘前能拿走多少，拿走多少，跟当年的国民党一样，「情况」比那还坏。

All kinds of indications show that the CCP is preparing to investigate and confiscate personal assets of each CCP member and their families. Therefore, insiders who know about it are trying to do everything possible to move their assets out. It also proves that the CCP knows very well that China’s financial collapse is coming. The CCP wants to grab as much as it can before the collapse, which is the same as the KMT’s situation back then, or even worse.

更夸张的，现在竟然有人拿国内的上市公司的股票到海外进行融资，这过去是不可能的，但在中东的这些皇家银行是可以做得到。抵押率5%，10%。别说30%了，「也就」5%，10%。这就说明了国内的经济和金融到了崩溃的边缘。

What is even more unbelievable is that some people now use the stocks of China’s domestic listed companies to raise funds overseas. This was impossible in the past, but those royal banks in the Middle East can do it. The mortgage rate is 5%, 10%. Don’t even think about a 30% mortgage rate, only 5% to 10%. This shows that China’s domestic economy and finances are on the verge of collapse.

还有他也发现一个很大的问题：他这家银行 — 皇家这家银行曾经帮助共产党的企业在乌克兰，在阿塞拜疆，在东欧的某些国家所做的一些金融票据很多现在都是违约的，但是他们不怕因为是有这个中共国家作为担保的，国家银行「担保」。

And he also found a big problem. Many financial instruments made by his bank, a royal bank, for the CCP’s companies in Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and some countries in Eastern Europe are now in default.  But they don’t worry about that because they have the CCP’s state guarantee, guaranteed by the CCP’s national bank.

「但」像国家开发银行很多很多事情都没法兑现，而且他也跟国开行的人见面「后说」国开行整个全行的人都在等待着最后一个：就是国开行的创始人都被抓起来。国开行几乎这几波人全抓完了。

But now, the China Development Bank cannot deliver on many commitments it previously made. After he met with people from the China Development Bank, he said that the whole bank was waiting for the other shoe to drop, that is, the arrest of all the founders of China Development Bank. Several waves of arrests have detained almost everybody from the bank.

再一个就是邮政银行。他们这个家族皇家银行当年参与了投资中国邮政邮储银行上市，它属于机构投资者，那么现在也要查这个事情 — 说明邮储银行出事儿了；当年农业银行上市的事儿也在查 — 说明农业银行也要出事儿了；招商银行吴小晖的事儿查完了；民生的事儿肯定完了……这就是一系列的现象都会出来。

The other problem is about the Postal Bank. Their royal family bank participated in the listing of the Postal Savings Bank of China in the past. They are an institutional investor. The CCP’s investigation into this matter now indicates that something is wrong with the Postal Savings Bank. The listing of the Agricultural Bank of China back then is also being probed. It means that something will happen to the Agricultural Bank. The investigation of Wu Xiaohui of China Merchants Bank is completed. The investigation of China Minsheng Bank must have finished. A series of developments will soon be revealed.

共产党会把所有的问题都积累到，像昨天我说的，积累到中共中央去，但到最后一定是瞬间的崩塌。兄弟姐妹们，「大家」可多保重啊！把这消息告诉 — 不过咱们战友们也没有那么多有钱的，是吧？也不需要这么多担心。

The CCP will accumulate all the problems, as I said yesterday, to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. But in the end, there must be an instant collapse. Brothers and sisters, take care of yourself. Tell the news to our rich fellow fighters… but we don’t have many of them, right? Then there is no need to worry too much.

但是战友们要知道共产党的金融系统要崩溃了，房地产市场要崩溃了，没人能幸免。基本过去几十年白打工了，染了一身病，累了一身病，但是你白干了！

But our fellow fighters should know that when the CCP’s financial system collapses and when the real estate market collapses, no one can be spared. Basically, in the past few decades, you have worked for nothing. You got diseases all over your body, you worked yourself into exhaustion and became sick, but you have endured it all for nothing.
