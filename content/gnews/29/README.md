## 共匪在台湾是真要有动作
` Himalaya Rose Garden Team` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/936651/)

新闻简述：在2021年2月4日的盖特视频中，郭先生劝说台湾战友离开台湾，因为据中共内部战友的情报，“共匪在台湾是真要有动作”。但是同时他也说：“说实在话，共匪一打台湾，共匪就结束了。”

**共匪在台湾是真要有动作**

**The CCP Is Seriously Considering Taking Actions in Taiwan**

就是台湾的战友，我的大牛兄弟，我的台湾巴黎妹妹，我们的台湾大帅哥，大美女，你们夫妻两个真的是，跟咱们战友都传达传达，今天刚刚我获得更多信息呀，这是共匪在台湾是真要有动作啊，不行台湾巴黎赶快来美国吧，只要能来，带着咱们战友，七哥保证你们，住的，吃的，工作，就是每年的工资，绝不亚于你在台湾的，只能比那多，不会比那少，七哥保证。

It is about my fellow fighters in Taiwan, like my brother Da-Niu, my sister Taiwan-Paris, a handsome guy, and a stunner. You couple really need to inform all our fellow fighters in Taiwan. I just received more information today: the CCP is seriously considering taking actions in Taiwan. If possible, come to the United States quickly, along with our fellow fighters. As long as you can get here, I will guarantee your accommodations, food, and jobs. Your annual salary will be no less than what you make in Taiwan. It can only be more, not less. I promise.

吃的不比台湾差，这你放心，中餐就不行了，七哥吃啥就让你吃啥，这点保证。真的要想想了，台湾的兄弟姐妹们你们真的要想想了，看来啊真是要有事啊，哎呀。说实在话，共匪一打台湾，共匪就结束了。但是想起台湾我的大牛兄弟，巴黎妹妹，还有那么多兄弟姐妹在那，真是担心，还有很多朋友啊，我那李祖原大师虽然是因为懦弱把我给抛弃了，但是他公司李祖源事务所的人，还有李大师我还是很惦记他呀，还有很多兄弟呀，我还是很惦记的呀。

The food will be no worse than Taiwan if not considering Chinese cuisine, so no worries about this. You will eat as well as I do, which is guaranteed. It is really time for you to think about this. Brothers and sisters in Taiwan, you really need to think about it. It seems that something is really going to happen. Truly I tell you, once the communist bandits attack Taiwan, the CCP will be finished. However, it worries me when thinking of my brother Da-Niu, my sister Taiwan-Paris, and so many brothers and sisters in Taiwan. There are also many other friends in Taiwan, like Master Chu-Yuan Lee. Although he abandoned me because of his cowardice, I am still concerned about him and the staff in his firm – the C.Y. Lee & Partners. There are many brothers out there that I still care about.

这几天发生了各种迹象，内部战友的各种情报，台湾真是不妙，真是不妙，如果是共产党在台湾这一动手，生灵涂炭，血流成河呀。这就是疯狂啊。中国历史上的政治斗争，绝大多数都是朝廷的内斗，现在可悲的是几千年后，中共中国人要不打中国人，只杀中国人的故事一次一次重演，天天说中国人不打中国人，在香港把中国同胞，香港同胞，全扔海里去了，扔海里还得轮了强奸了，掏肛。成天说对着台湾喊，中国人不打中国人，天天吓得半死。这回可能真的是不打台湾人，是杀台湾。

In the past few days, there were all kinds of signs and all kinds of intelligence from fellow fighters inside the CCP, which are really not good for Taiwan, really not good. If the CCP indeed attacks Taiwan, there will be mass casualties and a lot of blood will be shed. This is insane. The vast majority of the political struggles in Chinese history have been internal strifes in the imperial court. Sadly, thousands of years later, the CCP’s story of “Chinese do not fight Chinese, only kill Chinese” has been a recurring theme. The CCP says that the Chinese do not oppose Chinese on a daily basis, but in Hong Kong, it threw many Chinese and Hong Kong compatriots into the ocean after gang-raping them and humiliating them. The CCP always propagandized to Taiwanese that Chinese people do not fight Chinese, whereas the Taiwanese are scared half to death every day. This time they may not fight Taiwanese, but to kill Taiwanese.

你说咋弄？这真没办法，这流氓土匪，七哥要是有本事，如探囊取物一样，就把他给捏死在中南坑这些老杂毛，七哥马上就干哪，是吧？现在七哥是干着急啊，担心哪。但是刚刚我在运动的时候，咱们内部战友说，让台湾的战友能离开台湾就离开吧，弄得我心里戈登戈登的，所以说赶快拿起来手机录一段，盖特一下子。哎呀，兄弟姐妹们，共产党真疯了，我就很难想象，连猪都不如的智商几个老杂毛，想统治世界？这到底是世界要灭他？还是他自己要灭自己？不管谁要灭他，他能不能少祸害这些老百姓呢？没法弄，没法弄，兄弟姐妹们。

What can you say? There is no way to deal with these rogue bandits! If I had magical powers, I would have crushed those old bastards of the CCP who live in the Zhongnan Pit in no time, right? But now I can do nothing but be anxious and worried. A moment ago, while I was working out, a friend inside the CCP told me to ask our fellow fighters leave Taiwan if they can. These words are disturbing to me, so I quickly picked up my phone and recorded a Getter video. Aiya, brothers and sisters, the CCP is really crazy! I can’t imagine that those old bastards who are less intelligent than pigs want to rule the world?  Is the world trying to destroy them? Or are they destroying themselves? No matter who wants to destroy them, can they do less harm to the old hundred names? Well, it’s absurd, brothers and sisters.
