滄海一聲嘯
 A roar of the vast sea 
滔滔滅共潮
 The tidal waves surging up to take down the CCP 
四海英雄聚今朝
 Heroes from all over the world get together 
蒼天笑
 A laugh from heaven 
拔劍斬紅妖
 Take out a sword to behead the red demon 
浪沙淘盡毒霾消
 The waves and sands wash off the haze filled with poison

整整七十年它把中華人⺠奴役
 Having enslaved the Chinese people for a total of 70 years 還讓這片土地變得滿目瘡痍
 Rendered this land full of ruins and scars 
全世界投毒製造各種生化武器
 Dropped the virus to the whole world, making all kinds of biochemical weapons 
我去它大爺的人類命運共同體
 Screw the so-called Community with Shared Future for Mankind 
三載爆料攜手戰友行天道
 In the three years of whistleblowing we carried out God’s will with fellow fighters 
震醒我中華同胞，興起了滅共浪潮
 Wake up my fellow Chinese compatriots and set off a wave to take down the CCP 
壯志衝雲霄，看那國旗飄飄
 In the sky our aspirations are soaring with the flag of NFSC fluttering 
滅掉邪靈惡黨神州陽光普照
 Take down the evil CCP and bring sunshine back to China

江山笑
 A laugh from mountains and rivers 
天宇搖
 Shakes the sky and universe 
誰負誰勝出已分曉
 Who is the victor or loser is now obvious 
 ⻛蕭蕭
 The wind whistles 
真相掀怒潮
 The truth sets off raging tides 
盤古開天覆紅朝
 Overthrow the red regime of tyranny as Pangu created the earth and sky

三年多的爆料就是跟丫死磕
 Whistleblowing for over 3 years is just to keep smashing the CCP 
重磅實錘每天都有，一點兒也不嫌多
 We can never have too many breaking news and solid proofs every day

以美滅共以共滅共，還得靠我們戰友們行動
 Our fellow fighters’ actions are crucial to taking down the CCP with forces from both inside of CCP and America

天佑我中華兒女，共建聯邦新中國
 God bless our Chineses men and women who together build the New Federal State of China 
黑夜現曙光，照亮東方的天
 The dawn comes up in the darkness, lighting up the sky in the east 
戳破共匪的謊言，我準備了三十多年， 
 To expose the CCP’s lies I prepared for more than three decades 
越過了死亡幽谷，我踏上了滅共之路
 I crossed the valley of death, embarking on a journey to take down the CCP 
縱有太多凶險，我們不枉此生虛度
 Even with so much danger, our lives are not wasted

清⻛笑
 A laugh of breezes 
終歸正道
 finally returns to the Way of Righteousness 
一舟踏浪自逍遙
 An unfettered boat rides freely on the waves 
蒼生嘯
 A roar of Lao Baixing, Old Hundred Names 
熱血萬丈高
 Their passions are running high 
戰友們豪氣穿雲霄
 Our fellow fighters’ heroic spirit rises up through the clouds and sky 
盤古相聚在今朝
 Time to get together at Pangu now 
仰天⻓嘯贊英豪
 Look up and roar, praising the heroes of ours

Whatta you waiting for 
你還在等什麼? 
 The world is safe no more. 
世界已不再安全
 CCP lyin, The people’s dyin 
中共撒謊，人們死亡
 We are running outta time 
時不待我
 Action! 
行動! 
 Take Down 
滅共
 Action 
行動滅共
 Action 
行動
 Take down the CCP 
滅掉中共
 Take Down 
 Take down the CCP 
滅掉中共啦啦啦啦啦
 Lah lah lah lah lah 
 CCP 你完了
 CCP, you’re finished
