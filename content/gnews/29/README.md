英語標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep 206: Flood in China. Unwarned release of surging water from the dams



視頻重點

1. 8月16日 四川雅安寶興縣暴雨致國道351線中斷。路基懸空 路面塌陷！國道是全國性政治、經濟意義的主要幹線公路，大陸全國的交通建設工程總經費雖高，貪汙舞弊回扣金額也超乎想像巨大，導致工程建設品質低劣，大雨一來，國道不堪檢驗。
2. 國家防汛抗旱總指揮部秘書長周學文高調宣稱“大水之年往往是豐收之年。但據大陸民間的消息，今年的罕見大雨加上中共無預警洩洪，大面積農田被毀，今年收成堪憂，甚至可能絕收。
3. (CNBC，8月17日）關於華為的最新消息，據路透社報導，川普政府將進一步加緊對中共國公司華為的限制。 報導指出，商務部將採取行動防止華為在沒有特殊許可證的情況下獲得半導體，包括由外國公司使用美國軟件或技術開發或生產的晶片。
4. （Miles Guo. 8月16日）這個UAE的變化，現在大家知道的事情，中國共產黨根本不知道人家就建交了。 這是多麼的打臉哪。  因為這意味著中共整個一帶一路戰略、整個中東戰略、整個東非北非的徹底失敗。


1. 5. On August 16, in Ya’an, Sichuan, rain-induced flood cut off National Highway 351. The road foundation hanged in the air, while the road surface collapsed. National Highways are strategic infrastructure projects that involve many political and economic stakes. Because of the corruption at every level of these projects, which have extremely expensive price but horribly bad quality, to certain extent, these roads couldn’t even stand against the challenge of heavy rain.
2. 6. Zhou Xuewen, Secretary-General of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters said, “the year of the flood is often the year of harvest.” But people know the truth, as the flood caused by the heavy rains and the unwarned release of surging water from the dams already destroyed the harvest. The risk of food shortage is very high.
3. (CNBC) Breaking news now on Huawei. Reuters is reporting that the Trump administration will further tighten restrictions on the Chinese company. That report says the Commerce Department will move to prevent Huawei from obtaining semiconductors without a special license that includes chips made by foreign firms developed or produced using U.S. software or technology.
4. (Miles Guo, August 16) The UAE’s change of stance in the Middle East, as we all have heard, UAE and Israel established their diplomatic relations without the CCP acknowledging it in advance. What a slap in the face. For the cause of taking down the CCP, the significance of such move is tremendous.
