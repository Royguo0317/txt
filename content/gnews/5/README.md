**中英文对照全文**

Hello, dear honorable fellow fighters! Look at the car. What car is this, fellow fighters? This is the third one in the whole U.S. and the second in East New York. It is a specially customized Maybach SUV. I am going to attend a meeting and see some people. What do I do?

尊敬的战友们好！看这啥车？战友们？看这啥车？这是整个美国第三部，整个纽约东部第二部，特别订制迈巴赫SUV，迈巴赫SUV。七哥要去开会去啊，见点人啊，咋弄啊？

Ah, it is so interesting … now, the CCP is going to attack Taiwan, whereas the whole world, even the Biden administration, is researching on the damage this deadly [CCP] virus will cause to the U.S. and the world, and to the economy next. So, you see, brothers and sisters, who can avoid talking about the virus and the virus’s threat to the U.S. economy, the safety of the U.S., and the safety of the world?

哎呀，真好玩，你说这现在共产党要打台湾，结果现在全世界在研究，就连拜登政府都在研究，下一步病毒，致命病毒对美国、对世界的危害，对经济的危害。所以说你看看，战友们，谁能回避到病毒？病毒对美国的经济和对美国人身的安全和世界的人身安全。

Just now, two Americans told me, “Miles, we want to see you right away. We want to discuss about the profound impact of the [CCP] virus on the U.S. economy, U.S. technology, and national defense.” This is because many high-end talents and technical talents have insurance, which is very expensive. So, many insurance companies don’t want to sell high-level life insurance to these people. The more high-end you are, the more expensive the insurance will be. Hence, they don’t want to sell insurance to them because the risk is higher. After Larry King’s death, the insurance companies become more afraid. Wow, Larry king, how much money do I need to pay to you? Think about it. If it is the virus [causing the death], in particular to these scientists, all kinds of military scientists and important scientists, what would you do? Right?

刚才两位美国人跟我说：Miles，我们要马上跟你见面，我们要讨论一下病毒对美国经济和美国技术领域、国防领域的深远影响。因为很多的高端人才和技术人才，很多都是买的保险的，这个保险的价值很贵呀，那么现在很多保险公司都不想给这些人卖这些高级的这种人身保险，越高端人才你越贵，他就不想卖给你，因为风险越大。这个 Larry King 死了以后，保险公司更害怕了，哇噻，你 Larry King 这钱，我得赔你多少钱？你想想如果是这病毒，特别这些科学家，各种军事，各种重要的科学家，你咋办呢？对不对？

So, all governments must face the threats of the CCP virus to all mankind, its attack to the economy, and its strike to the entire social structure. Therefore, brothers and sisters, please remember my words: Early joy will lead to early decline, and early sadness will result in early grief.

所以说共产党的病毒对全人类的威胁和经济的打击，和对整个社会结构的打击，任何政府都不能不面对。所以兄弟姐妹们，牢记七哥说的话：早乐必早衰，早悲必早哀。

Has everyone seen the opportunity? The CCP is now going to attack Taiwan. You [the CCP], try attacking Taiwan, try it. Yet, if it does not attack Taiwan until later, it will be attacked by its own insiders. The CCP hopes to live a few days longer by attacking Taiwan; otherwise, it will live a few days shorter. Anyhow, it will not stay alive for long.

大家看到了机会了吗？现在要打台湾。你打台湾试试，你打台湾试试。但是如果他晚一点不打台湾，他内部就把他给打了。打台湾他想多活几天，不打台湾少活几天，反正他是活不了了。

There is another thing that everyone needs to take a look at: the so-called “the CCP has won” these days. How about its economic status? Everyone, take a close look at its economy. Take a close look, brothers and sisters. This is something … nobody can change the fact that the CCP is going to perish or this great era. I won’t say anything more. I will broadcast again when I can find time. Haha! Thanks!

还有一个，大家要看一看。这些天所谓共产党赢了，但是经济情况啥样？大家仔细看看这经济情况，仔细看一看。兄弟姐妹们，这就是一个无法，任何人都无法改变的共产党灭亡的事实，还有这个大时代。啥都不说了，抽时间再直播。哈哈哈，谢谢！谢谢！
