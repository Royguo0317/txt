## 川普總統新聞發佈會摘要（2020.8.11）
`2020-08-13 05:42 GM31` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hant/295276/)

川普總統于2020年8月11日舉行新聞發佈會，敦促紐約、波特蘭、芝加哥和西雅圖的民主黨市長和州長允許員警做他們的本職；彙報了“曲速行動”和疫苗的進展，以及新冠病毒的最新情況；回答了關於哈裡斯參議員的惡劣行徑，外國情報監視法（FISA）濫用和西雅圖撤資員警的問題。



Before providing today’s update on the China virus, I want to address the violence, looting, and rioting taking place in the Democrat-controlled cities of New York, Portland, Chicago, and Seattle. The mayors and governors of these states and cities have an absolute duty to use all resources necessary to end the violence and all of the injury and death.

在提供今天關於中國病毒的最新情況之前，我想先談談發生在紐約、波特蘭、芝加哥和西雅圖等民主黨控制的城市的暴力、搶劫和騷亂。這些州和城市的市長和州長絕對有責任使用一切必要的資源來結束所有的暴力和傷亡。

New York City has an army of great police. I know them very well. And the law enforcement and the New York’s Finest are as good as it gets, and they should be allowed to do their job. If they do their job, if they’re allowed to do their job, the New York City problem will be solved and be solved quickly. They do it well.

The mayor, Bill de Blasio, should immediately hire back all of the police who were fired without justification. They were fired. I guess that’s part of “Defund the Police” by the Democrats. They should hire New York City’s Finest back. You have some incredible policemen doing specific jobs that nobody else can do, actually, when it comes to terrorism and other things.

紐約市有一支優秀的員警隊伍。我很瞭解他們。執法部門和紐約市警察局是最優秀的，應該讓他們做他們的工作。如果他們被允許做他們的工作，紐約市的問題將會得到解決，並迅速地解決。他們會做得很好。市長比爾·德.布拉西奧應該立即回聘所有無正當理由被解雇的員警。他們被解雇了。我想這是民主黨“撤資員警”的一部分。他們應該把紐約市最優秀的員警請回來。實際上，當涉及到恐怖主義和其他事情時，你有一些令人不可思議的員警做別人無法替代的特殊工作。

Together, the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois have 25,000 police officers, sheriffs, and Guardsmen available to quell any violence. They can do it very quickly, very easily if allowed to do their jobs — again, if allowed to do their jobs. Our police, our law enforcement is incredible, but they have to be allowed to do their jobs. The Democrats or the radical-left Democrats — or both, because they’re becoming one and the same, if you look at election results — the Democrats are being taken over by the radical left.

芝加哥市和伊利諾州有2.5萬名員警、警長和衛兵，可以平息任何暴力事件。如果允許他們做他們的工作，他們可以非常迅速、非常容易地完成——前提是允許做他們的工作。我們的員警，我們的執法人員是不可思議的，但他們必須被允許做他們的工作。民主黨或激進左派的民主黨人——或者兩者，因為他們正在融合同化，如果你看看選舉結果——民主黨正被激進的左派所接管。

The city of Portland and the state of Oregon have 10,000 fine officers and Guardsmen available. Seattle, Washington, and Washington State have 10,000 available. So Seattle — the city of Seattle and Washington State itself, they have great people. They have to be allowed to do their job. I’m urging them to deploy these resources to protect their citizens and to stop the violence and all of the things that we watch on television going on — although a lot of the, unfortunately, fake news don’t like to put it on because it shows that the Democrats are doing a very bad job of law enforcement. They have to put it on. They have to be honest with the people of this country.

波特蘭市和俄勒岡州有1萬名優秀的軍官和警衛。西雅圖、華盛頓和華盛頓州有1萬人可用。因此，西雅圖——西雅圖市和華盛頓州本身，他們都有出色的警員。他們必須被允許做他們的工作。我敦促他們部署這些資源，以保護他們的公民，並阻止暴力和所有我們在電視上看到的事情發生——雖然很多，不幸的是，假新聞不喜歡播放它們，因為它表明民主黨在執法方面做的非常糟糕。他們必須播放。他們必須對這個國家的人民誠實。

But I’m offering all available federal support requested to stop the violence and arrest the criminals. We have to be asked by the governors or the mayors, and we’ll be there very rapidly. It’s ready, willing, and able. We’re all ready, willing, and able to go to these jurisdictions and take care of them. We’ll do them very quickly. You saw what happened in Minneapolis; they ripped the city apart. When the National Guard went in, it ended immediately. It was immediate and lasted.

但我正在提供所有的聯邦支援，以阻止暴力和逮捕罪犯。州長或市長們必須向我們求助，而我們會很快就趕到現場。準備就緒，願意，以及有能力。我們都準備好了，願意，並且能夠去這些轄區，並維護他們。我們會非常迅速地去做。你看到在明尼阿波利斯發生的事情;他們把城市破壞了。當國民警衛隊進入，它立即結束。它曾是立即的，持續的。

These acts of destruction are not isolated incidents, but demonstrate the pattern of violent, leftwing extremism that you get to see if you’re watching the right news program. Under any rational definition, the arson attack on the police precinct in Portland would be considered an act of leftwing domestic terrorism. They really are anarchists. These are leftwing anarchists. They are anarchists. And I’m directing the Department of Justice to stop these anarchists — immediately, to stop them — and to work with the city and the state to get the job done.

這些破壞行為不是個例的事件，而是展示暴力、左派極端主義的模式，如果你看的是正確的新聞節目，你就能看出這種模式。在任何合理的定義下，對波特蘭員警分局的縱火襲擊都會被認為是左派國內恐怖主義的行為。他們真的是無政府主義者。這些是左派無政府主義者。他們是無政府主義者。我正在指示司法部立即阻止這些無政府主義者——立即，阻止他們——並與市政府和州政府合作，完成這項工作。

Local authorities have to investigate and prosecute all of these crimes immediately. We’ll work with you. And the local authorities know who they are. They know where they come from. They know a lot about them. They ought to get their act together and get it done, and we’re ready to help. If you need that help — you shouldn’t need that help, actually. You should be able to do it yourselves and get it done very well. Again, you have excellent police and law enforcement, but you have to let them do their job.

地方當局必須立即調查和起訴所有這些罪行。我們會和你們一起合作，而地方當局知道他們是誰，知道他們從哪裡來，知道很多關於他們的事情。他們應該振作起來，把事情辦好，我們隨時準備提供幫助。如果你需要這種説明——實際上你本不應該需要這種説明。你們應該能夠自己做，而且做得很好。再重申一遍，你有優秀的員警和執法部門，但你必須讓他們做他們的本職。

What you’re seeing in Portland and Seattle, New York, Chicago is really the Democrat roadmap for America. They want every city in America to resemble Portland, in a form. They want to pass federal legislation gutting and hamstringing every police department in America. They want to get rid of your Second Amendment. They want to end cash bail; close prisons; defund police departments — or at least largely defund. You see that with New York. A billion dollars they took out of their police department, and crime has gone through the roof. And appoint far-left prosecutors who side with the criminals and target law-abiding citizens. If the left gains power, no city, town, or suburb in our country will be safe.

你在波特蘭和西雅圖，紐約，芝加哥看到的，真的是民主黨的美國藍圖。在某種程度上他們希望美國的每一個城市都像波特蘭一樣。他們想通過聯邦立法，削弱和限制美國的每一個員警部門。他們想抹消你的第二修正案。他們想結束現金保釋、關閉監獄、撤資員警部門——或者至少在很大程度上撤資。你在紐約就能看到這一點。他們從警察局抽走了10億美元，而犯罪率直線上升。並任命極左的檢察官，他們站在罪犯一邊，針對守法公民。如果左派得勢，我國沒有一個任何城市、城鎮或郊區會安全。

On the vaccine front, some very good news. Today, I met with the leaders of Operation Warp Speed, our historic undertaking to produce a safe and effective vaccine in record time. We heard an update from the top scientists and the government and the leaders of pharmaceutical companies, which, right now, aren’t too thrilled with me. They’re taking millions of dollars’ worth of ads because I’ve created a favored-nation status for drugs, which is going to reduce drug prices by 40, 50, 60, and maybe even 70 percent in some cases — numbers that have never been heard or thought of. So when you see those ads, remember: That means your drug prices are coming down. When you see ads attacking your President, it’s very simple — that means drug prices are going to be falling very soon.

在疫苗方面，有些非常好的消息。今天，我會見了“曲速行動”的領導人，我們的歷史性任務是在創紀錄的時間內生產出安全有效的疫苗。我們聽到了來自頂級科學家、政府和製藥公司領導人的最新消息，而後者現在對我不太高興。他們投入了數百萬美元的廣告，因為我創造了藥品的惠國政策，這將使藥品價格降低40%、50%、60%，甚至在某些情況下可能降低70%——這是從未聽說過或想像過的數字。所以當你看到這些廣告時，請記住：這意味著你的藥價會下降。當你看到攻擊你的總統的廣告時，這很簡單——這意味著藥品價格很快就會下降。

This evening, I’m pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Moderna to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidate. The federal government will own these vaccine doses; we’re buying them. Recently, we also secured partnerships with Johnson & Johnson, as well as Sanofi and GSX [GSK] to support the large-scale manufacturing of their vaccines. Doing very well on those vaccines — tremendous promise in every single one of them, and we have many of them. And they’re years ahead of schedule. This would have been — if it were in the previous administration or any of the previous administrations, where we are now would have taken years.

今天晚上，我很高興地宣佈，我們已經與莫德納（Moderna）達成協議，製造和交付1億劑冠狀病毒疫苗候選疫苗。聯邦政府將擁有這些疫苗劑量，我們正在購買它們。最近，我們還與強生、賽諾菲和葛蘭素史克（GSK）建立了合作夥伴關係，以支援其疫苗的大規模生產。在這些疫苗上做得非常出色——在每一個疫苗中都有巨大的前景，而我們有許多疫苗。而且他們比計畫提前了幾年。如果是在前一屆政府或前幾屆政府中，我們現在的進度可能需要數年時間。

Three vaccine candidates are now in phase three trials already — the final stage of clinical trials. This is the final stage. We are investing in the development and manufacture of the top six vaccine candidates to ensure rapid delivery. The military is ready to go. They’re ready to deliver a vaccine to Americans as soon as one is fully approved by the FDA, and we’re moving very close to that approval.

現在已經有三種候選疫苗進入第三階段試驗——臨床試驗的最後階段。這是最後階段。我們正在投資開發和製造前六名候選疫苗，以確保快速交付。軍隊已經整裝待發了。他們準備一旦獲得食品和藥物管理局（FDA）的完全批准，就儘快向美國人提供疫苗，而我們正非常接近這一批准。

We’re on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses, as soon as the vaccine is approved, and up to 500 million shortly thereafter. So we’ll have 600 million doses. Operation Warp Speed is the largest and most advanced operation of its kind anywhere in the world and anywhere in history.

一旦疫苗獲得批准，我們有望迅速生產1億劑疫苗，不久之後將生產多達5億劑。至此我們會有6億劑。“曲速行動”是世界上規模最大、最先進的行動，也是歷史上最先進的行動。

We’ve treated more than 86,000 Americans with convalescent plasma. A recent Mayo Clinic study found that this treatment may produce results which are incredible. We look to a reduction and reduced mortality rate by 50 percent, and possibly even more than 50 percent.

我們已經用療養血漿治療了8.6萬多名美國人。梅奧診所最近的一項研究發現，這種治療可能會產生不可思議的結果。我們期待將死亡率降低50%，甚至可能超過50%。

As we continue to confront the global pandemic, the United States economy is rebounding with strength like nobody thought possible. You’ve seen the numbers. You see what’s going on yesterday, today — and tomorrow, in my opinion. We’re very poised for a great third quarter and very poised for some great stock market numbers and 401(k) numbers and everything else. Today, the Dow Jones passed 28,000 points for the first time, more than a 50 percent surge since just March. So we’ve increased by 50 percent more than since just March. It has gained approximately 9,500 points that same period — March — and has recovered nearly all of its value since the virus struck our nation — think of that.

隨著我們繼續面對全球大流行病，美國經濟正在以無人能想像的力度反彈。你已經看到了這些數字，在我看來，你看到了昨天、今天和明天發生的事情。我們準備好了迎接一個非凡的第三季度，也準備好了迎接一些非凡的股市數字和401(k)數字和其他一切。今天，道鐘斯指數首次突破2.8萬點，自3月以來漲幅超過50%。同一時期——3月——它上漲了約9500點，而且自從病毒襲擊我們國家以來，它已經恢復了幾乎所有的價值。想想看。

America’s economy is incredible, and its economic recovery is outpacing our peer nations. Last quarter, the European Union’s GDP decline was nearly 40 percent worse than the United States. So it’s 40 percent worse than the United States. We’ve built such a strong base that we’re able to do things and sustain better than anybody in the world, by far. France’s GDP decline was nearly 80 percent worse than ours. And Spain experienced an economic contraction twice as severe as the United States.

美國的經濟是不可思議的，其經濟復蘇速度超過了我們的同行國家。上個季度，歐盟的GDP下降幅度比美國差近40%。我們已經建立了如此強大的基礎，到目前為止，我們能夠比世界上任何人做得更好，更能夠維持下去。法國的GDP下降比我們的差近80%。而西班牙經歷的經濟萎縮是美國的兩倍。

Nationwide, we continue to see improvements in our fight against the pandemic — very substantial improvements. Since last week, 87 percent of the counties in the United States report declining cases. Think of that: 87 percent of the counties in the United States, they reported declining cases. Mortality has declined by 7 percent, and hospitalizations are declining rapidly. States that were primary hotspots, such as Florida, Texas, and Arizona have reduced cases by nearly 25 percent. But all Americans must remain vigilant, practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask whenever possible. Whenever you are getting too close to people, wear a mask. And protect the elderly — always protect the elderly.

在全國範圍內，我們繼續看到我們抗擊該流行病的工作有所改善——非常重大的改善。自上周以來，美國87%的縣報告病例呈下降趨勢。想想看：美國87%的縣報告病例呈下降趨勢。死亡率下降了7%，住院率正在迅速下降。佛羅里達州、德克薩斯州和亞利桑那州等主要熱點州已經減少了近25%的病例。但所有美國人必須保持警惕，養成良好的衛生習慣，社會距離，盡可能戴口罩。每當你離他人太近時，都要戴上口罩。並保護老人——永遠保護老年人。

Since the end of July, the seven-day average for cases in the United States has fallen by nearly 20 percent, but the virus continues to increase in nations across the globe. Last week, France and Germany both recorded their highest daily number of new cases in three months — not that I want to bring that up, but might as well explain it to the media. The seven-day case average for Germany has increased by 62 percent since last week, unfortunately — and that is truly unfortunate. It’s increased 82 percent in France, 113 percent in Spain, and 30 percent in the United Kingdom. Those are big increases. Cases are also rapidly increasing in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland, Slovakia, Estonia, and other European countries. And in our country, they’re going down. We will be seeing that even more rapidly as time goes by — a short time.

自7月底以來，美國病例的7天平均值下降了近20%，但全球各國的病毒仍在增加。上周，法國和德國都創下了三個月來日均新增病例數的最高紀錄——不是我想提出來，但是不妨向媒體解釋一下。不幸的是，自上周以來，德國的7天案件平均病例增加了62%，這真的很不幸。法國增長了82%，西班牙增長了113%，英國增長了30%。這些都是很大的增幅。荷蘭、瑞典、比利時、瑞士、斯洛伐克、愛沙尼亞和其他歐洲國家的病例也在迅速增加。而在我們國家，他們正在下降。隨著時間的推移，短時間內，我們會看到這種情況更加迅速。

Even though America is the largest at-risk population — including 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times that of other European countries — Europe has experienced a nearly 40 percent higher excess mortality rate than the United States. We also have fewer deaths per capita, excluding the disastrous deaths from the New York tri-state area — which had a very, very hard time — and did better than our peer nations of Western Europe, thanks to our excellent and highly advanced medical care and skill — something that the news doesn’t tell you. They don’t tell you that. They don’t like to tell you that.

儘管美國有最大的高危人群——包括150萬療養院居民，約為其他歐洲國家的5倍——但歐洲的死亡率比美國高出近40%。我們的人均死亡人數也較少，不包括紐約三州地區的災難性死亡——那是一段非常艱難的時期——並且比歐洲的同行國家做得更好，這要歸功於我們優秀的、高度先進的醫療服務和技術——這一點是新聞不會告訴你的。他們不會告訴你這些。他們不喜歡告訴你這些。

The United States has now conducted more than 66 million tests, far more than any other nation in the world. India, which has a population of 1.5 billion people, has done 24 million. So we’re at 66 million. And think of it: India is at 24 million, and India is second. The entire region of Latin America, comprising 33 countries, has conducted 25 million tests. Yet, Latin America has more confirmed cases, by far, than the United States.

美國現在已經進行了6600多萬次試驗，遠遠超過世界上任何其他國家。印度有15億人口，卻只進行了2400萬次。所以我們現在已經達到了6600萬。你想想看。印度是2400萬，印度還是第二位。整個拉美地區，包括33個國家，已經進行了2500萬次測試。然而，拉丁美洲的確診病例遠遠多於美國。

As we safely restore our great economy and reopen our schools — and hopefully we can watch colleges play football. We want to get football in colleges. These are young, strong people. They won’t have a big problem with the China virus. So we want to see college football start, and, hopefully, a lot of great people are going to be out there. They’re going to be out there, playing football, and they’ll be able to fight it off. And hopefully, it won’t bother them one bit. Most of them will never get it, statistically. But we know we’ll see more cases at some point, and we will eventually develop sufficient immunity, in addition to everything else that we’re doing.

當我們安全地恢復我們磅礴的經濟和重新開放我們的學校時——希望我們可以觀看高校踢橄欖球。我們希望大學踢橄欖球。這些都是年輕力壯的人。他們不會受中國病毒大的影響。因此，我們希望看到大學橄欖球運動開賽，希望很多出色的選手會出現。他們會在那裡打球，他們能抵抗它。希望這對他們沒有任何影響。據統計，他們中的大多數人永遠不會得到它。但是我們知道，我們在某個時候會看到更多的病例，除了我們所做的其他事情之外，我們最終將產生足夠的免疫力。

So, college football, get out there and play football. People want to see it. And stand for your American flag, stand for your national anthem because people are not happy when that doesn’t happen.

所以，大學橄欖球隊，出去踢橄欖球吧。人們想看到它。並捍衛你的美國國旗，捍衛你的國歌，因為如果你不這樣做，人們不會高興。

You look at the NBA and what’s happening with the NBA and their poor ratings. I don’t know; can’t imagine why. But they didn’t stand, they didn’t show respect to our flag. They didn’t show respect to our anth- — our National Anthem. And maybe that’s having an impact, but just not good.

你看看NBA的情況和NBA很差的收視率。我不知道，無法想像為什麼。但他們沒有站起來，他們沒有對我們的國旗表示尊重。他們沒有對我們的國歌表示尊重。也許這是有衝擊力的，但只是不好的。

The NFL had its problems, two years ago, when that happened. They went way down in their ratings and their fans, and they struggled back. And now, all of a sudden, they’re putting themselves in the same position. So stand for your flag and stand for the National Anthem, and I think you’re going to do fantastically well. Because a lot of people aren’t going to watch if you don’t; I’m one of them.

兩年前，當這種情況發生時，NFL也遇到了問題。他們的收視率和球迷都大為下降，他們又掙扎著回來了。而現在，突然之間，他們又把自己放在了同樣的位置。所以，捍衛你的國旗，捍衛國歌，我想你就會做得非常好。因為如果你不這樣做，很多人都不會看；我就是其中之一。

That’s why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require discussing the opening of schools, hospitalization, or produce any death. We have to maintain vigilance over our elderly population. We’ve learned that, I think, more than any single event, Scott. We have to be very vigilant all over, but we have to really protect our elderly population, and especially our elderly population that has problems with heart, lung, any form of sickness — diabetes, in particular.

這就是為什麼我們的戰略和關注集中在防止最有可能需要討論開學、住院或導致任何死亡的病例上。我們必須為年老人口保持警覺。我認為，我們比任何單一活動都瞭解這一點，斯科特。我們必須在各地保持高度警惕，但我們必須真正保護我們的老年人口，特別是患有心臟、肺病、任何形式的疾病——尤其是糖尿病——的老年人口。

And we are, at the same time, in very good shape with respect to hospital room and hospital overcrowding. We’re in great shape.

同時，我們在醫院房間和醫院過度擁擠方面的情況也非常好。我們的情況很好。

On the nursing-home front, protecting our nursing home residents is a critical focus of our strategy. HHS recently announced that they will use the Provider Relief Fund to deliver an additional $5 billion to further protect nursing homes and long-term care facilities as they continue to combat the China virus.

在療養院方面，保護我們的療養院居民是我們戰略的關鍵重點。國土安全部（HHS）最近宣佈，他們將利用供應商救濟基金，再提供50億美元，以進一步保護療養院和長期護理設施，繼續與中國病毒抗擊。

We’ve delivered over 1,800 rapid point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes. And we’re in the process of delivering these vice- — devices to all 15,000 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes by the end of September. So they’re going to have very, very rapid tests. They won’t have to wait around two or three days or four days.

我們已經向養老院提供了1800多台快速護理點檢測設備。我們正準備在9月底前將這些設備提供給15000家經醫療保險和醫療補助認證的療養院。因此，他們將有非常，非常快速的檢測。他們將不必等待兩三天或四天左右。

And that number has come down very substantially, compared to what it was. When you send it to the labs, you get very accurate tests, but it takes a period of time to send it, to check it, and then to send it back. But we are now at a position where we’re sending very, very rapid tests — 5 minutes to 15 minutes.

與以前相比，這個數字已經大幅下降。當你把它送到實驗室時，你會得到非常準確的測試，但它需要一段時間來發送，檢查，然後再送回來。但我們現在的情況是，我們正在發送非常、非常快速的測試——5分鐘到15分鐘。

We will care for America’s seniors as we develop the vaccine and therapeutics. And therapeutics are coming along very, very well. We think we have some great answers on therapeutics, and you’ll be hearing that — about them in the very near future. I’m very much into the world of therapeutics, where you go into the hospital, and you give a shot, or you do what you have to do with a, perhaps, transfusion. There’s combinations of what you can do, and people get better. I like that very much. I like that very, very much.

我們將在開發疫苗和治療方法的同時，照顧美國的老年人。而治療效果非常好。我們認為我們在治療上有一些很好的解答，你會在不久的將來聽到這些解答。我非常喜歡治療學，你去醫院打一針，或者你做一些你必須做的事情，也許是輸血。你可以把各種方法結合起來，讓人們的病情好轉。我非常喜歡這樣，非常喜歡。

And that could even precede — and it’s successful in getting it — that will, I think, probably, even precede vaccines. But therapeutically, we’re doing very, very well. A lot of people are going to be very happy when they see some of the numbers that we’re — that I’m seeing, and some of the results.

這甚至可能先于——而且成功地得到——這甚至可能先於疫苗的誕生。但是在治療上，我們做得非常非常好。很多人會非常高興，很多人都會非常高興，當他們看到一些，我們——我看到的數字，和一些結果。

So, tremendous things are happening on the vaccine front and the therapeutic front, and our country should be very proud of itself. We’re going to get it delivered very rapidly, as soon as it comes out.

所以，在疫苗方面和治療方面都有了巨大的進展，我們的國家應該為自己感到驕傲。我們會極快地把（疫苗）送達，只要它一出來。

記者提問：

Q: Twenty million people are due to be evicted from their homes next month. Do you fear that this could be your Herbert Hoover moment if you do not reach a deal with Congress to set up a new CARES Act?

問：兩千萬人將在下個月被驅逐出家門。如果你不與國會達成協議，制定新的CARES法案，你是否擔心你會成為第二個赫伯特·胡佛（Herbert Hoover）？

A: No, we are — we are not allowing that to happen. We’re stopping evictions. We are stopping evictions. We’re not going to let that happen. We’re not going to evict people. We’re not going to let people — the Democrats, maybe they don’t care, but I care. And we signed an executive offer — you know, executive order. You know that, right? And we are not letting people be evicted.

答：不，我們——我們不允許這種情況發生。我們正在阻止驅逐，我們正在阻止驅逐。我們不會讓這種事發生，我們不會驅逐人們。我們不會讓人們——民主黨，也許他們不在乎，但我在乎。我們簽署了一份行政命——你知道的，行政命令。你知道的，對吧？我們不會讓人們被驅逐。

Q: Regarding Senator Harris’s record: You had a pretty quick response to that. You had an ad out that said that she was a “phony.” And I wanted to ask about a specific example that a lot of people thought was a phony moment. As San Francisco DA, she oversaw, according to the Mercury News, 1,900 marijuana convictions. But she was asked in an interview last year if she had smoked marijuana, and she appeared to joke and, according to some people, lie, and say that she was listening to Snoop Dogg and Tupac, while — their music hadn’t come out at the time, while she said she was smoking pot and listening to it. Why would she lie about that? Do you see that as more evidence — is her past on marijuana a liability?

問：關於哈裡斯參議員的記錄，你對此反應非常迅速。你有一個廣告，說她是一個“騙子”。我想問一個具體的例子，很多人都認為是假像。作為三藩市地方檢察官，她監督了，根據《聖約瑟信使報》，1900起大麻定罪案。但是在去年的一次採訪中，她被問及是否吸過大麻，她似乎開了個玩笑，或據一些人說她撒了謊，說她在聽史努比狗狗和圖派克的音樂，而他們的音樂當時還沒有出來，但她說她曾邊聽邊抽大麻。她為什麼要撒謊？你認為這是更多的證據——表明她過去抽過大麻的可能性嗎？

A: Well, she lied. I mean, she said things that were untrue. She is a person that’s told many, many stories that weren’t true. She’s very big into raising taxes. She wants to slash funds for our military at a level that nobody has — can even believe.

答：嗯，她撒謊了。我是說，她說了些虛假的話。她是一個講了很多很多虛假故事的人。她非常希望增稅。她想削減我們軍隊的資金，其程度是任何人都無法相信的。

She is against fracking. Fracking is — she’s against petroleum products. I mean, how do you do that and go into Pennsylvania or Ohio or Oklahoma or the great state of Texas? She is against fracking; fracking is a big deal.

她反對（油氣儲層）水力壓裂技術。水力壓裂是——她還反對石油產品的。我的意思是，你如何做到這一點，但還去賓夕法尼亞、俄亥俄州、奧克拉荷馬州或德克薩斯州？她反對水力壓裂。水力壓裂是個大問題。

She is in favor of socialized medicine, where you’re going to lose your doctors, you’re going to lose your plans. She wants to take your healthcare plans away from 180 million Americans — 180 million Americans that are very happy with their health insurance. And she wants to take that away.

她贊成社會化醫療，這會讓你失去你的醫生，你會失去你的（醫療）計畫。她想把醫療計畫從1.8億美國人那裡拿走——1.8億個對醫療保險很滿意的美國人。而她想奪走這些。

So she was my number-one pick. I mean, she was — as they would say, because hopefully you’ll start college football — she was my number-one draft pick. And we’ll see how she works out.

所以她曾是我的頭號選擇。我是說，她曾是——正如他們所說的，因為希望你能開始打大學橄欖球——她曾是我的頭號選擇。我們會看看她的表現如何。

She did very, very poorly in the primaries, as you know. She was expected to do well, and she was — she ended up at right around 2 percent, and spent a lot of money. She had a lot of things happening. And so I was a little surprised that he picked her. I’ve been watching her for a long time, and I was a little surprised.

正如你所知，她在初選中表現得非常非常糟糕。她被期望做得很好，而她最終的得票率只在2%左右，還花了很多錢。她發生了很多事情。所以我對他選擇她感到有點意外，他選擇了她。我觀察她很久了，我有點驚訝。

She was extraordinarily nasty to Kavanaugh — Judge Kavanaugh, then; now Justice Kavanaugh. She was nasty to a level that was just a horrible thing. The way she was — the way she treated now-Justice Kavanaugh. And I won’t forget that soon.

她對卡瓦諾——當時是卡瓦諾法官，現在是卡瓦諾大法官，格外的厭惡。她下流到了一種程度，簡直是令人恐怖。她的行徑——她對待如今的卡瓦諾大法官的行徑。短時間內都不會從我的腦海消失。

So she did very poorly in the primaries, and now she’s chosen. So let’s see how that all works out.

所以她在初選中表現很差，現在她被選中了。因此，讓我們看看看事態如何發展。

Q: Should supporters of marijuana legalization vote for you, rather than her, because she convicted so many people in the past?

問：大麻合法化的支持者應該投你一票，而不是她，因為她在過去判了這麼多人？

A: I can’t tell you what she’s voting for. I don’t think she knows what — I think Joe knows even less than she does. But I was only surprised at the pick. A lot of people were saying, “That might be the pick.” I was more surprised than anything else, because she did so poorly. Many people did much better than her in the primary. She did very poorly in the primaries. And that’s like a poll. You know, that’s like a poll.

答：我不能告訴你她投了什麼票。我想她也不知道什麼，我想喬知道的甚至比她少。但我只驚訝於這個選擇。很多人說，“這可能就是贏家”。我比什麼都驚訝，因為她表現太差了。許多人在初選中比她強很多。她在初選中表現很差。這就像一場民意測驗。你知道的，這就像一場民意測驗。

Q: Now it’s widely accepted among Republicans that there was FISA abuse in — The Justice Department IG has found out, with Carter Page foreign application. But we were actually warned in 2013 that the Surveillance Court was, allegedly, a rubber stamp. It was approving surveillance. I don’t think, as President, you’ve commented on Edward Snowden, but do you think he should be allowed to return without going to prison?

問：現在共和黨人普遍認為，司法部監察局已經發現，卡特·佩奇外國申請中存在FISA濫用。但我們實際上在2013年就被警告，據稱，監視法庭擅離職守。它正在批准監控。作為總統，你並沒有評論過愛德華·斯諾登，但你認為他應該被允許在不坐牢的情況下回來嗎？

A: So as far FISA abuse is concerned, there was tremendous FISA abuse. It’s amazing that it’s taken this long. And everyone knows that it’s been proven very substantially. Not only FISA abuse — changing documents and putting documents in front of the FISA court and courts that are disgraceful that they could have done it.

答：就FISA濫用而言，存在著巨大的外國情報監視法（FISA）濫用。令人驚訝的是，它持續了這麼長時間。大家都知道，這早已得到了非常實質性的證明。不僅是FISA濫用——更改文檔，還將這些檔放在FISA法院和法院面前，可恥的是，他們可以這樣做。

And the fact is we caught Joe Biden, President Obama, the whole group. You can look at Brennan and Comey and Clapper and the whole group. We caught them spying on our campaign. This was an illegal act like no other illegal act. This was treason. This was at the highest level of treason. And Obama and Biden got caught spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies of the United States government to do it, both before and after the election. So before the election and then after I won, they continued. It’s totally illegal activity, and now we just have to see what’s happening.

事實是，我們抓住了喬.拜登，奧巴馬總統，整個集團。你可以看看布倫南、科米、克拉珀和整個集團。他們監視我們的活動被我們抓了個正著。這是其他非法行為無法相比的。這是叛國罪，這是最高級別的叛國罪。奧巴馬和拜登在競選前後都利用美國政府的情報機構，對我的競選活動進行監視。意味著在選舉之前，以及在我獲勝之後，他們還在繼續監視。這是完全非法的活動，現在我們只需拭目以待。

But as far as Kamala is concerned, she’s a big tax raiser, she’s a big slasher of funds for our military, and she’s got a lot of difficult things that she’s going to have to explain. Plus, she was very, very nasty to — one of the reasons it surprised me, she was very — she was probably nastier than even Pocahontas to Joe Biden. She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. And it’s hard to pick somebody that’s that disrespectful. When she said things during the debates — during the Democrat primary debates — that were horrible about Sleepy Joe. And I would think that he wouldn’t have picked.

但就卡馬拉而言，她是一個大的增稅支持者，她是我們軍隊資金的大削減支持者，她有很多複雜的勾當將不得不解釋一下。另外，她對喬·拜登非常非常厭惡——這是讓我吃驚的原因之一，她非常——她可能比波卡洪塔斯更厭惡喬·拜登。她對喬·拜登非常不尊重。讓人很難選擇一個如此無禮的人。當她在辯論中說了一些——在民主黨初選辯論期間——對瞌睡蟲喬的惡毒評價。我想他不會選的。

Q: Yesterday, Seattle City Council voted to cut funding for their police department, and the police chief there, Carmen Best; the first black woman to serve in that capacity — she resigned hours later. What does this say about our country? And what does this say about the Defund Police movement?

問：昨天，西雅圖市議會投票決定削減他們員警部門的資金，而那裡的警察局長卡門·貝斯特——第一個擔任該職位的黑人女性——她在幾個小時後辭職了。這對我們的國家說明了什麼？這對“撤資員警”運動說明了什麼？

A: Well, I think that Seattle, in spite of all that they’ve been through, with the embarrassment of having a radical left group — Antifa and others — take over a big portion of the city of Seattle — we’re talking about a big city, a major city. That they allowed that to happen is incredible. That it took so long to fix is incredible. And the only reason they went in is because they knew we were going in the following day, and so they preceded us. They didn’t want that to happen. They don’t want to be embarrassed.

答：好吧，我認為西雅圖，儘管他們經歷了這麼多，尷尬地被激進的左派組織——安提法和其他組織——霸佔了西雅圖市的一大片地區——我們談的是一個大城市，一個主要城市。他們允許了這種情況發生是令人難以置信的。花了這麼長時間才修復好是不可思議的。他們進去的唯一原因是因為他們知道我們第二天要進去，所以他們先於我們進去。他們不希望這種情況發生。他們不想讓自己難堪。

And the people just gave up. They weren’t — they were exhausted from having taken over a city for so long.

而那些人們就這樣放棄了。他們沒有——他們因為霸佔一座城市這麼久而精疲力竭了。

The police commissioner seems like a very good woman. They were going to slash her salary by 40 or 50 percent. And they cut a tremendous amount off the police department — really, where people are saying it’s not sustainable as a good police department. And, again, those police are good also, but they’re not allowed to do their job.

警察局長看起來是個很好的女警。他們打算削減她40%或50%的薪水。而且他們削減了員警部門的大量資金——真的，人們都說作為一個好的員警部門，這是不可持續的。而且，這些員警也很出色，但是他們不被允許做他們的工作。

So I think it’s a shame. I hate to see her go, because she did, in her own way, a very good job, but she wasn’t effective in convincing the mayor and the city council to give the funds that were needed or just leave the funds the way they are.

所以我覺得很可惜。我不想看到她離開，因為她以自己的方式做了一份非常出色的工作，但她沒有有效地說服市長和市議會提供所需的資金，或者只是讓資金保持現狀。

They’ve done a big — a big defund, a big part of it. And it’ll probably get worse before people realize this is a tragic error, before people start dying and getting hurt very badly. So I think Seattle has made a tragic mistake. I think Portland has no clue as to what they’re doing. They have no clue. And hopefully, there’ll be asking for help because we can solve their problem very, very quickly.

他們做了一大大的撤資，很大的一部分。在人們意識到這是一個悲慘的錯誤之前，在人們開始死傷慘重之前，情況可能就會變得更糟。所以我認為西雅圖犯了一個悲劇性的錯誤。我認為波特蘭根本不知道他們在做什麼，他們根本不知道。希望他們會尋求幫助，因為我們可以非常，非常迅速地解決他們的問題。

Q: On Senator Harris, is she going to help former Vice President Biden’s chances in November? Or is she going to hurt his chances?

問：關於哈裡斯參議員，她是會助長前副總統拜登在11月（贏得大選）的機會？還是她會損害他的機會？

A: Well, I like Vice President Mike Pence much better. He is solid as a rock. He’s been a fantastic Vice President. He’s done everything you can do. He’s respected by every religious group. Whether it’s evangelical, whether it’s any other group, they respect Mike Pence.

答：嗯，我更喜歡副總統邁克·彭斯。他堅如磐石。他一直是位出色的副總統。你能做的他都做了。他受到了每個宗教團體的尊敬。無論是福音派，無論是任何其他團體，他們都尊重邁克·彭斯。

He’s been a great Vice President, and I will take him over Kamala and the horrible way she, again, treated Justice Kavanaugh. That was a horrible event. I thought it was terrible for her. I thought it was terrible for our nation. I thought she was the meanest, the most horrible, most disrespectful of anybody in the U.S. Senate.

他是一位很棒的副總統，我願意接受他，而不是卡馬拉，她再次以惡毒的手段對待卡瓦諾法官，那是個駭人聽聞的事件。我覺得這對她來說很糟糕，我覺得這對我們國家來說也很糟糕。我認為她是美國參議院中最卑鄙、最可怕、最無禮的議員。

She’s also known, from what I understand, as being just about the most liberal person in the U.S. Senate. And I would have thought that Biden would have tried to stay away from that a little bit. Because with what they’re doing with open borders and sanctuary cities — where they’re trying to protect sanctuary cities, which is also protecting a large number of criminals; with all of the things that they’re doing — Second Amendment. They want to take away your Second Amendment or modify it to a point where it’s essentially no longer the Second Amendment. I would have thought he would have gone a different way.

據我瞭解，她也被稱為美國參議院最自由主義的人。而我原以為拜登會試圖遠離這一點。因為他們在開放邊界和避難所城市所做的——他們試圖保護避難所城市，這也保護了大量罪犯;與他們正在做的所有事情——第二修正案。他們想奪走你的第二修正案，或者把它修改到面目全非的地步。我還以為他會走另一條路。
