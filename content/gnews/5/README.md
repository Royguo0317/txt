**摘要：在2021年4月25日的GTV直播中，郭先生在爆出中共辽宁号航母租借俄罗斯飞行员之后，继续爆出中共以假治国，解放军根本不掌握发动机和芯片等军事核心技术，只能靠大批收买前苏联各国的军事人员，将他们安置于在青岛、大连、哈尔滨和三亚等地。军方高层只懂吃喝嫖赌，毫无战斗力。**

**中共以假治国  不掌握军事核心技术  只能雇佣大批前苏联专家**

**CCP Has Former Soviet Union Military People Working for Them**

然后头两天文贵爆的那个航空母舰，还有那个平衡器电瘫对国内影响非常大。说你这一爆，他说：“为什么你知道这么多事儿啊？这是很核心的。” 就共产党啊，战友们要记住，共产党大家要记住，就共产党这个家伙它是以假治国。就中国人玩潜水艇还有玩什么航空母舰，扯球蛋呢啊。大家你们都真的是有但凡跟军队这些人接触你就知道咋回事儿。就原来说的坦克走100米能偏1米，你能玩啥呀？

The news that I broke two days ago, which was about the [Liaoning] aircraft carrier’s stabilizing system being paralyzed, has had a great impact in mainland China. I was asked by someone, “Why do you know so many details? They are at very high confidentiality level.” Brothers and sisters, remember – because this is very crucial – that the CCP mafia is ruling the country with falsehood, then you would know that the submarines and aircraft carriers boasted by them must be bullshit. Everyone, if you know any [CCP’s] military people in person, you would know what I mean. Say, if for every 100 meters, their tanks can go off 1 meter, what can you expect them to do well?

就是苏联解体后的军事专家、科学家、飞行员，乌克兰的，包括原来很多格鲁吉亚籍的加入的乌克兰原苏联的，包括原来车臣的一些，一些被那个普京上来打压的那些所谓的军人原苏联地区的，几乎到最后全都到了中共给弄过来了。这些当兵来了以后，先进行给你签合同，你家人全迁到中国来。大连呐、东北哈尔滨呐。你但凡在哈尔滨东北的你去看看，有多少原苏联那是在那块儿生活啊？他们都是要服务于军工的，他不会做轻工，他只能军工。然后把这些人全弄来，在哈尔滨，在大连，在东北生活，全家过来你不能再离开了，给你高薪。

The military experts, scientists, and pilots from Ukraine, including many Georgian nationals who joined Ukraine from the former Soviet Union, also including some from Chechnya, and soldiers from the former Soviet Union who were suppressed by Putin, almost all of them were brought to China by the CCP. After these military people arrive, they will first sign a contract, and all family members will then move to China, to Dalian or Harbin in Northeast China. If you live in Harbin, you can go and see how many people from former Soviet Unions live there. They all serve in military industries because they don’t know anything about light industry. All these people and their families were brought here and settled in Harbin and Dalian in the Northeast China. The whole family will come over and you can’t leave anymore, and you will be paid a very good salary.

然后呢在海南三亚那地方有一帮人，他们喜欢那个地方，定居在那里。这些人服务什么？——航空母舰、潜水艇。中共玩潜水艇，别以为他吹牛，早着呢！早着呢！潜水艇、海军事业都是这帮人。这就是所谓的“代工”，这是很正常的。

Also there is a group of people in Sanya, Hainan Province. They like that place and settle down there. Where do these people serve? Aircraft carriers and submarines. The CCP claims that it’s good at submarines, but don’t believe their brags. They are far from being good, very far! Submarines and all other naval businesses are supported by the aforementioned people. This is the so-called outsourcing, which is normal.

有很多战友不到这个层次你不知道，（哎呀，我这敏感啊，）所以说当你知道共产党这一套东西的时候你就明白了。所以它很丢人，它吹狼蛋呢，吹狼蛋呢。只有咱们很多普通的人没见过这世面，听它吹很过瘾。像我们这成天在一起呢，这胡扯，胡扯呢。这回一练就知道了，航空母舰趴在那儿了，甭说去打仗了，侵略台湾了，你开到台湾都开不过去。

There are many fellow fighters who are not aware of this because they are not at this level. Oh, my allergy. So when you know about CCP’s businesses, you will understand what I mean. So it’s very shameful for them to always brag like that. Only a lot of ordinary people who have never seen the real world would enjoy listening to their brags. People like me who hang around with them all the time know that they always talk nonsense. This time their aircraft carrier came out and showed people what it really is. The aircraft carrier was paralyzed right there. Let alone go to a war with Taiwan [with the aircraft carrier], you can’t even move it to Taiwan.

所以说这个爆料影响非常大对国内，影响很大。这就是我们路波切兄弟需要了解的，我们博士军团需要了解的。航空母舰你要想了解中国军事，你必须了解苏联的军事，原苏联，了解原苏联的军事和原苏联所有解体后的各国家的所有这些武器技术的去向和动静，这是非常了解中共的最核心，最最核心的。

So this breaking news really had a huge impact in mainland China. And this is what our Brother Lude needs to understand and what our Ph.D. Team needs to understand: Talking about aircraft carriers, you need to understand the Chinese military, and you must know the Soviet Union’s military, its army, and know the whereabouts of all the weapons and technologies from all the former Soviet Union states after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This is the most critical thing that you need to know if you wan to understand the CCP.

那么另外一个就是现在芯片。就是我们博博士每次艾丽、墨博士、冠博士、我们路波切每次还有安红都讲这个芯片，芯片已经讲透了，芯片。芯片是核心。中共没有生产芯片的能力，没有和所有控制英文世界的源代码的能力。你更不具备生产军事上的两大核心一个叫引擎，咱叫发动机。不论是天上地上的，最大核心就是发动机。你生产不了发动机，你只能买别人的，你买别人的发动机，那发动机是人家产的，那里面全是外国的文化，外国的语言，你能解读得了吗？扯淡吗这不是吗！

Another thing now is about the chips. Dr. Bo, Ms. Ai Li, Dr. Mo, Dr. Guan, Mr. Lude and Ms. An Hong always talk about chips. Chips have been thoroughly covered and explained by them. Chips are the core. The CCP doesn’t have the ability to make chips, and doesn’t have the ability to control the source code in the English world, let alone the two core technologies in the military industry. One core technology is called engine, whether it’s in the sky or on the ground. If you [the CCP] can’t make engines yourself, you will have to buy other people’s engines, but the engines made by other people are from foreign cultures from inside out. Can you fully understand their languages? [Without your own chips,] everything is just nonsense, isn’t it?

所以就找雇佣兵，必须维护它的发动机，航空母舰、潜水艇都是一样儿。你都难以想象在青岛有多少所谓的俄国专家基地。在大连、哈尔滨、三亚叫俄国专家楼啊俄国什么都是所谓原苏联的吃不了饭的军工人员维护你的最核心，也就是军队所用的发动机，中国人玩不了，怎么可能啊。

Therefore, you have to find mercenaries so you can outsource the maintenance of engines, aircraft carriers, and submarines to them. You can hardly imagine how many so-called Russian expert bases are in Qingdao. They are called Russian expert buildings in Dalian, Harbin, and Sanya for military personnels coming from former Soviet Union where they had a hard time to survive. They came to you [the CCP] to maintain the most critical technologies for you, that is military engines. The Chinese are incapable to do it themselves, and how could they be?

第二个是通信，是吧？所有的通信，通信的核心是芯片。你说你通信你产不了芯片，你能有安全的通信吗？什么北斗7星，你北斗9星也不中啊，你没芯片能行吗？那么你有芯片，它一系列的东西都出来了，这时候就加密、语言、安全，你根本做不了，你最终这些东西还得找到外国偷的还要找外国专家，甚至找外国专家来帮你。就这么简单！就这么简单的事儿。

The second [core technology] is communication, right? But what lies in the core of all communications is the chip. If you say you can’t make chips, how can you have secured communications? Even though you have the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (note: BeiDou means the 7 stars of Big Dipper in Chinese), can you make them work without a chip? Not even if you had a nine-star Big Dipper! If you have chips, then you can make a series of things, such as encryption, language, and security, but you can do none of these. So in the end, you still have to either steal technologies from foreign countries or find foreign experts to help you. It’s that simple! It’s that simple!

中共只要你生产不出来跟你武力和你野心相匹配的发动机，还有通信的芯片，你什么都是球扯淡。懂这个就行了。就像我那时候成天和那军人在一起，哎呀，演习完回来以后全都跑到我那去吃，吃完以后出去嫖去，哪个人旁边都带着小女当兵儿了。

As long as the CCP can’t produce the engines that match its military power and ambition, can’t produce chips, everything it talks about will be just bullshit. You all must understand this. Just like those days when I hung around with those PLA military personnels, whenever they came back from a military exercise, they all came to my place to eat. After eating, they went out to have sex, and every single one of them would bring a young military girl with them all the time.
