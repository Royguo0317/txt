Christmas is right around the corner. It’s hard to believe how fast time has flown this year. When there is little travel, or barely any get-togethers with friends or family, days turn into weeks, and weeks into months. For me, it all feels like a continuous long day in which only the seasons change, as we complete our respective routines and unremarkable life projects.

So, when Christmas is sneaking upon us, I feel the sudden flow of time and a sense of urgency to prepare my heart for the season. Starting with the rituals, I hang the wreath on the front door, pin my Christmas stocking on the fireplace mantel, pour myself a cup of eggnog and put on some Christmas music.

One carol after another, the music fills me with a sense of peace, joy and hope, as the story of Christ unfolds: God sent his only begotten son to this Earth, He let him be crucified on the cross to pay for the sins of all Mankind, and then He resurrected Him to conquer death, so that whoever believes in Him shall never perish but have everlasting life.

It is a story of the ultimate triumph – Good prevails over evil. It is an act not by men but a gift of God. All that is asked of us is our personal choice to partake in this triumph, through faith in Jesus Christ.

In a year filled with so much unresolved strife, Christmas is such a great reminder that darkness will be overcome by light, and truth and justice will eventually prevail. Most importantly, we are reminded of the need to keep our faith – in our religious lives as well as in our fight against the forces of darkness.

This 2020 holiday season is clouded by the darkness of the Chinese Communist Party. We’ve been struggling with the CCP virus for almost a year and now we are struggling with an election result distorted by the CCP and its collaborators in the US. If they succeed in taking over this country, our struggle will not be measured in months but years or even decades.

Think of the hundreds of thousands in Wuhan who are gone, their lives not even acknowledged. Think of our brethren in Hong Kong, having been stripped of their freedom or are now disappeared. Think of the concentration camps in Xinjiang. Think of the cost of the virus to the global economy, and how this has robbed the poorest of the world any chance of escaping poverty in the next decade to come. How much more of such atrocities can innocent people take without any actions? Meanwhile, the CCP leaders are patting each other on the back, clicking celebratory glasses in high toasts for their successes. The contrast is sickening.

But through all this we must summon our collective inner strength. It is the responsibility of our generation. We must not bend or flinch, even as the arrows come straight for our hearts. Standing together in solidarity we must shoulder this storm and keep our faith in this fight for a better future.

For many, faith is a tricky subject. It is so closely linked to a religious belief that it makes us feel uncomfortable or difficult to talk about. But faith transcends religion. It is an adherence to certain beliefs, principles and convictions. More than just mere sentiment or posture, faith is backed by deeds and actions.

Therefore, our faith in building a democratic future for the Chinese people requires sound organization and concrete actions; our faith in the rule of law demands equal treatment for all in front of the law; our faith in righteousness will not tolerate any iniquities. Faith only exists when we practice what we preach. The Bible says it best in James 2:26 – As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.

Be reminded, these are turbulent times; we are living through the Fourth Turning. Yes, hardship will surely come. There will be sacrifices. Nothing on the other side of this will ever be the same.

Still, our victory will come because the cause we are fighting for is a righteous one. Keeping this faith unites us in purpose, and through our actions we grow stronger and more determined each day.

This season, as we hear the Christmas carols around us, we must pause and listen. And we must heed the call: O Come, All Ye Faithful!
