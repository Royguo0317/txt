Chinese virologist who fled to the US after claiming Beijing covered up Covid-19 vows to publish evidence PROVING the virus is manmade – and claims even non-scientists will be able to verify the data

- Respected Chinese virologist Dr. Li-Meng Yan claims coronavirus was manmade
- Appeared on Loose Women today from secret location after fleeing Hong Kong
- Former researcher at the University of Hong Kong claimed her data was deleted
- Chinese national health commission have denied claims outbreak started in lab


在斷言北京掩蓋新冠病毒（Covid-19）真相後，逃離至美國的中國病毒學家發誓將公佈證據，證明該病毒是人工製造，並表示既使是非科學人士也將能夠驗證這些資料資訊。

- 令人尊敬的中國病毒學家閆麗夢博士斷言新冠病毒是人工製造的
- 跳離香港後，（閆博士）在一個秘密地點出鏡接受Loose Women的採訪
- 這位元香港大學前研究員聲稱關於她的資訊已被刪除
- 中（共）國國家衛生委員會否認疫情爆發源自實驗室


A virologist who claimed the Chinese government covered up the coronavirus outbreak says she will produce scientific evidence the virus was man-made.

一位斷言中（共）國政府掩蓋了新冠病毒爆發真相的病毒學家聲稱，她將提供科學證據力證該病毒是人工製造的。

Respected Chinese virologist Dr Li-Meng Yan, who specialised in virology and immunology at the Hong Kong School of Public Health, claimed that Beijing knew about the coronavirus well before reports began to emerge.

閆麗夢博士曾在香港大學公共衛生學院專攻病毒學和免疫學，這位元令人尊敬的中國病毒學家聲稱，在相關報導開始頻頻出現之前，北京就已經掌握了新冠病毒的情況。

She has since been forced to flee Hong Kong fearing her life is in danger, and appeared today on Loose Women from a secret location, revealing that the Chinese government had ‘removed all her information’ from government data bases.

因擔心自己的生命處於危險之中，她被迫逃離香港。今天她在一個秘密地點出鏡接受Loose Women的採訪，並表示中（共）國政府已從政府資料庫中“刪除了她的所有資訊”。

Dr Yan claimed that reports that Covid-19 originated at a wet market in Wuhan are a ‘smoke screen’, and that she plans to publish a report she claims has evidence the virus is manmade.

‘The first thing is the meat market in Wuhan is a smoke screen and this virus is not from nature,’ Dr Yan said.

閆博士聲稱，Covid-19起源於武漢的一個海鮮市場的報導是一個“煙幕彈”，她計畫發表一份報告，出示該病毒是人工製造的證據。

閆博士說道：“首先，武漢的肉類菜市場是一個煙幕彈，這種病毒不是自然產生的。”

When asked where the virus comes from, the scientist replied: ‘It comes from the lab in Wuhan.’

‘The genome sequence is like a human finger print’, she said. ‘And based on this you can identify these things. I will [use this] evidence to tell people why this has come from the lab in China, why they are the ones who made it.

當被問及病毒來自何處時，這位科學家答道：“它來自武漢的實驗室。”

“基因組序列就像人類的指紋”。她說道：“據此可以識別不同的病毒。我將[用此]證據告訴人們，為什麼這是來自中國的實驗室，為什麼是他們製造的。”

‘Anyone, even if you have no biology knowledge, will be able to read it, and check and identify and verify it yourself.

‘It is critical to understand it, we can not overcome it, it will be life-threatening for everyone.’

She claimed that ahead of fleeing her country, her information was wiped from government databases and that her peers were ‘told to spread rumours about her’.

‘任何人，即使您沒有生物學知識，都可以讀懂，並自己去核實、鑒別和驗證。

“瞭解該病毒至關重要，（因為）我們（目前）無法戰勝它，這將危及每個人的生命。”

她透露，在逃離中（共）國之前，她的相關資訊已從政府資料庫中被抹去，她的同齡人“被告知要散佈關於她的謠言”。

‘This is some common sense for Chinese people’, she said. ‘We know under Chinese government [they are at risk]

‘They deleted all my information and also they told people to spread rumours about me, that I’m a liar, I don’t know anything, I just killed a hamster in the lab. They will try to control my family and friends and then suddenly I don’t exist.’

這是中國人司空見慣的事”。 她說道：“我們知道在中（共）國政府的統治下[他們始終處於危險境地]

他們刪除了我的所有資訊，還要求人們散佈有關我的謠言，說我是個騙子，什麼都不懂，只是個在實驗室裡殺倉鼠的。他們設法控制我的家人和朋友，突然我就像不存在了。”

The virologist was based at a prestigious Hong Kong university, one of the world’s leading centres for researching infectious diseases and a key part of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) global epidemiology network.

這位元病毒學家來自香港一個知名大學，該大學是世界領先的傳染病研究中心之一，也是世界衛生組織（WHO）全球流行病學網路的一個重要組成部分。

Yan says she was one of the first scientists to study the coronavirus that would become known as Covid-19, and claims at the end of December 2019 she was asked by her supervisor at the University to look into an odd cluster of SARS-like cases that had erupted in mainland China.

閆博士說，她是最早研究新冠病毒的科學家之一，那就是後來被稱為Covid-19的病毒。她還聲稱在2019年12月底，她所在大學的主管要求她研究一個在中國大陸疑似SARS聚集性爆發的反常病例。

Through her medical and scientific contacts she claims to have stumbled upon a cover-up of epic proportions, but her evidence about human transmission and claims Beijing deliberately distorting details of the virus’ origins were ignored.

通過她在醫學和學術方面的人脈，她聲稱偶然間發現了這個史無前例的掩蓋真相的行為。但是她收集的關於人傳人的證據，以及披露北京方面故意撰改該病毒起源的細節都被忽略了。

As the death toll rose, Dr Yan felt she had a moral and scientific duty to blow the whistle on the cover up, and is now in hiding after travelling to the US, and fears that her life is in danger.

隨著死亡人數的不斷上升，閆博士覺得她有道義和科學的責任站出來揭露真相。在抵達美國後，（閆博士）目前隱居在美國某處，並擔心自己的生命時刻受到威脅。

‘I was a medical doctor and PHD, said Yan, ‘I work with a bunch of the top experts in the world and because I had my two degrees from mainland China, I was the one assigned to do the secret investigation about new pneumonia in Wuhan.

閆博士說：“我曾是一名醫生和博士（PHD），並與世界上許多頂尖專家一起工作。因為我擁有中國大陸的兩個學位，所以我被指派對武漢出現的新型肺炎進行秘密調查。

‘During my investigation, what I found I reported to my supervisor, there was no response, because everyone was worried.

‘So I kept silent, I knew I had to tell people because it’s urgent and on the account of a famous Chinese YouTuber in the US it was told to the world [that] China had discovered the Covid situation and [that] human to human transmission already exists.’

“在調查期間，我發現我向主管報告的情況沒有得到回應，因為每個人都很害怕。”

“所以我保持了沉默，但我知道我必須告訴人們，因為這很緊急，然後通過一個在美國著名的中國油管主播頻道，向全世界廣而告之[中國]出現了新冠病毒疫情，而且已經出現人傳人的情況。”

Yan claimed she saw ‘nobody responding’ to her reports of human to human transmission, and that while there is fear surrounding Chinese government, she ‘could not keep silent’.

From the beginning, I decided to get this message out in the world and it was very scary in the world because I’m a doctor and I knew if I don’t tell the truth to the world I will regret it myself in the future.

She went on: ‘I never thought this would happen when I did the secret investigation, I [thought] I would speak to my supervisor and they would do the right thing on behalf of the government.

閆博士說，她注意到無人對她人傳人的報導作出回應，儘管對中（共）國政府心懷恐懼，但她“無法保持沉默”。

從一開始，我就決定將這個資訊傳到世界各地。這是世上發生的一件非常恐怖的事，因為我是一名醫生，我知道如果我現在不向世界說出真相，將來我會為自己感到懊悔。

她繼續說：“當我進行秘密調查時，我從未想到過會發生這種情況，我[想]只要和我的主管說了，他們會代表政府做出正確的應對。

‘But what I saw was nobody responding to that. People are scared of the government but this was something urgent, and Chinese New Year time, [I knew] this was a dangerous virus and all these things meant I could not keep silent, there are human beings and global health [at risk].’

The Chinese national health commission have denied the outbreak started in the lab, saying there is no evidence the new coronavirus was created in a laboratory.

A spokesperson told ITV: ‘The fact is there is no delay or cover up whatsoever from the Chinese government, it reported virus data and relayed information as soon as possible to the international community.

‘As soon as cases were identified in Wuhan city China acted immediately to conduct investigations to stop the spread of the disease’.

“然而我沒看見有任何人對此做出回應。人們害怕政府，但這是個緊急事件，（特別）是在中國新年的時候，[我知道]這是一種極度危險的病毒，所有這些事情讓我無法保持沉默，人類和全球健康都處於[危險中]。 “

中（共）國國家衛生委員會否認疫情爆發源於實驗室，稱沒有證據表明新冠狀病毒是在實驗室中產生的。一位發言人告訴ITV：“事實上，中（共）國政府沒有拖延通告或掩蓋任何事實，且已儘快向國際社會報告了病毒資料並傳達了相關資訊。武漢市一發現病例，中（共）國（政府）就立即採取了行動進行調查，以阻斷該病毒的傳播”。
