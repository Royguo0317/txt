**美国防部正式将中建、中海油、中芯国际和国际工程咨询公司列入制裁名单**

由国防部决定的对这四家公司的制裁为永久制裁，直至被众议院三分之二多数投票终止。这四家军民融合公司，表面是安全部牵头的公司，实际上涉及统战部、总参、中联部、外交部等中共情报部门，这些部门派出的每一个人都带着秘密任务。这些公司被正式制裁后，美国人、美国供应商、华尔街都必须停止为其提供服务。

**DOD**** ****officially**** adds CSCEC, CNOOC, SMIC and CIECC to ****sanction**** blacklist.**

The sanctions imposed by the DOD against these companies are permanent until the House revokes it with two-thirds votes.  These four military-civil-fused companies seems to be under the leadership of Ministry of State Security of CCP, while it in fact ties with the CCP’s intelligence departments, such as the United Front Work Department, (Communist) China Emblem PLA.svg and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc., which has expatriated their agents with secret missions. After these companies are officially blacklisted, every American and every American supplier, as well as the Wall Street, are not allowed to provide service for them anymore.

**国家情报总监华尔街日报发文：中共对美国会议员的渗透频率是俄罗斯的****12****倍****，是伊朗的****6****倍**

渗透频率倍数这个数据的提出，意味着几乎每个国会议员都在FISA法案下被纳入了合法监控范围，这也是众议院能如此顺利通过《外国公司问责法》的原因。拉特克利夫还说，他对自己看到的情报感到震惊，中共对国会议员行贿、勒索，让其只通过对中共有利的法律，包括习近平在内的中共高层知道病毒真相但对全世界撒谎，武汉就是病毒的起源地，中共正在盗窃美国对病毒的研究。

**DNI said in the Wall Street Journal that Communist China is waging a ****“massive influence campaign” targeting US lawmakers with six times the frequency of Russia and twelve times that of Iran.**** **

The noted frequency of “mass influence campaign” demonstrates that almost every congressman or congresswoman is under the surveillance of FISA, which should be the reason why the House easily passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. Ratcliffe commented that he was shocked by the intelligence he gets, that CCP bribes and blackmails the congressman into voting for pro-CCP policies and bills. The top CCP leaders including Xi Jinping have known the truth of (CCP)Virus but lie to the world. Wuhan is the origin of the (CCP)Virus and Communist China is stealing the US’ studies about the coronavirus.

**美参议院通过《技术移民公平法》，对中共军人和党员不予发放签证和绿卡**

这是该法案最大的亮点，第一次在法律中明确将中共和中国人区别开来。这是爆料革命三年多努力的结果。这让美国这一刀切下去的时候，保留了中国人中的正义力量—新中国联邦的公民，有了这个火种，新中国联邦一定会成为有民主、自由、法治，更是有实力的国家。

**US Senate passed Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act, banning CCP members from visas and green cards.**

The highlight of the bill is that it explicitly distinguishes Chinese people with CCP, which should be the result of the effort of Whistle-blowers Movement over 3 years. It preserves and protects the righteous power of Chinese, the citizens of New Federal State of China, when US is taking measures to eliminate the CCP. With the tinder of free Chinese, New Federal State of China must be a country of democracy, liberty, rule of law and power.

**FOX****金牌主持人****Tucker****说：习近平轻则过失杀人、重则大屠杀罪**

他还说，閆博士冒着生命危险来到自由世界，揭露病毒源于中共实验室，却被与中共独裁者勾结的高科技公司噤声。閆博士揭露的病毒来源让美国看清中共邪恶本质，而大选被操纵则让美国明白中共是来消灭自己的，忍让几十年后再无退路，唯有反击。

**Fox News’ famous host Tucker Carlson said Xi Jing Ping at best has committed a criminal negligence but at worst is a mass murderer.**

He also said that Dr Li-Meng Yan has risked her life for fleeing to the land of freedom, to reveal that the (CCP)Virus is originated in the CCP’s labs, however, she is muzzled by those Big Techs colludes with the CCP. The Origin of CCPVirus revealed by Dr Yan has US see through the evil of the CCP while the manipulation of the Election make the US truly aware, that CCP is coming for it and there is no way out but to strike back and take it down, as they have tolerated this demon for decades.

**乔拜登说自己与哈里斯有原则分歧就必须辞职**

乔拜登说，如果我与哈里斯有某些原则分歧的时候，我会（被）患上某些疾病，而且我必须辞职。

**Joe Biden said he must resign if he has a “fundamental disagreement” with Harries.**

Joe Biden said should he has a “fundamental disagreement” on a “moral principle,” he would have “developed some disease” and resign.
