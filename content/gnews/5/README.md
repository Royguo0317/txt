简述：在3月26日的盖特视频中，郭先生指出在美国历史上，宪政危机和经济危机几乎总是同时发生，世界即将经济大乱，而所有全世界的乱因背后都跟中国共产党有关系。



**美国目前的宪政危机****  ****世界即将到来的恶性通货膨胀和经济危机**

**Uncertainties in the US Politics and the Upcoming Economic Crisis**

我昨天说了美国有辛普森夫人。乱猜，都猜得不对。但是你看到昨天白宫的记者招待会了吗？看看昨天维吉尼亚大选的结果出来了吗？美国在一场宪政危机中。查查美国的历史，所有美国历史的宪政危机和经济危机几乎是同时的双胞胎。而且让我这两天最最关注的，兄弟姐妹们，咱不希望世界大乱，但是世界真在往大乱的方向发展。世界要真的大乱了，唯一受益者就是新中国联邦。所有全世界最后的乱因最后发现，都是跟共产党有关系。

Yesterday I said that there is a “Mrs. Simpson” in the U.S. Then people tried to guess who this person is, but no one has got it right. Have you watched the White House press conference yesterday? Did you see the result of the Virginia election come out yesterday? The U.S. is in a constitutional crisis. Please check the American history. Constitutional crises and economic crises always came together in the U.S., like twins. Brothers and sisters, the thing that has attracted most of my attentions is that the world is on the path to a chaos even though we don’t want to see that happen. The world is really going in that direction. The only beneficiary will be the New Federal State of China (NFSC). The reasons for all the chaos in the world are all connected with the CCP.

你看看昨天美国的各大院校内部的这个信息、Email都传疯了。就是这几天所谓的美国，头两周就告诉大家了，共产党发动了所谓的海外的他BGY的媒体，包括科学家知识界，还有什么娜塔莉、彼得·达萨克。说当时共产党病毒为啥没给你美国、国际提供真相啊？就是因为郭文贵啊，班农啊，路德啊，闫博士啊爆料了，所以说他不敢提供了。你说这帮王八蛋，这话也说的出来，现在怎么样？来了，全世界都开始了，连欧洲都开始了。昨天欧洲帝国理工的我们几个战友，都是英国人，纯英国人，说：Miles，真没想到他们这么样的..叫什么？中文翻过来就是脸皮那么厚，不要脸，竟然真的敢这么做。BBC的记者竟然打电话问他们说，是不是因为这些人的爆料让共产党不敢提供真相了？你说有多夸张这个世界，有多夸张。

Please look at the emails sent around in the universities in the US yesterday, which has gone viral. It is about the so-called America – I told everyone two weeks ago – the CCP has launched its BGY plot oversea on people in media and academia, such as Natalie and Peter Daszak. They said  that the reason that the CCP didn’t provide the truth about the CCP virus to America and the world is because Miles Guo, Bannon, Lude, and Dr. Li-Meng Yan had exposed the truth early, so they didn’t have the courage to tell the truth voluntarily. How could these bastards say something like that? Well, the whole world and even Europe were triggered. Yesterday, a few fellow fighters, British people, from Imperial College London said, “Miles, I cannot believe they could be so…” If we translate the words into Chinese, they mean “so thick-skinned and shameless.” They [the CCP] really dared to do so. A BBC reporter even called them and asked whether it is true that the CCP didn’t have the courage to provide the truth because these people had exposed the truth? How crazy is the world! How absurd!

但是真正的我就告诉他们，我说：跟着共产党的人，不是魔鬼就是流氓，跟着共产党不是魔鬼就是流氓，早晚都得跟着共产党走进火葬场。着什么急啊？这个先不说，再说咱这几天的经济。今天是星期五。这时间很快，上星期一之前，华尔街的很多我的过去的哥儿们，金融界的，他说：Miles, 这周可能经济要出大事，我说经济出不了大事，他说经济会暴跌。我说不会暴跌，会有起伏。为什么？所有这些人最起码他知道一个常识，美国的恶性通货膨胀已经到来。

I told them that people who follow the CCP are either devils or rogues, and sooner or later, they will follow the CCP to a crematorium [to death]. What’s the hurry? Let’s move forward and talk about the economic situation the past few days. Today is Friday. Time flies. Prior to last Monday, many friends of mine from the Wall Street and the financial sector said to me, “Miles, something big about the economy is going to happen this week.” I told them that the economy will not have any big event. He said that the economy will plummet, but I said it will not, yet there will be ups and downs. Why? All these people have at least the common sense that a severe hyperinflation in the U.S. has arrived.

你去想想现在，美国几个大的过万亿的州，GDP的州，有多少人在工作？没人工作，现在很多人都收到钱，1400，1400，1400。你靠啥？全都靠印钞票。但有些人他不工作，他怎么出生产结果呢？没有生产力怎么有生产结果呢？怎么有生产价值呢？他全靠印钞票。而且现在很多人、行业，像服务行业、酒店行业，是吧？整个是崩塌式的倒闭，餐饮业简直惨大了，你怎么可能经济继续下去呢？

Think about the few states which have a gross domestic product (GDP) over a trillion dollars. How many people are working? Nobody. Yet, many people are receiving money, 1400 dollars. How? By printing money. If people are not working, how can you have product? How can there be products without productivity? How can you create values? Everything is relying on printing money. Now, many people and industries such as hospitality industry and hotel industry are collapsing and closing down. The restaurant industry is completely knocked down. How could your economy be sustaining?

现在大家全搞什么？互联网经济，搞房地产，怎么可能呢？然后就指望Google、苹果这些大的科技公司。在全人类都在走向一个通货膨胀的时候，你怎么可能继续下去那？美国都吃特斯拉汽车？都吃手机？不可能的，是吧？所以说他必将走向恶性通货膨胀。但是就是昨天晚上说：哎，老郭你真厉害，你说的太对了，有跌幅没有造成大的金融危机。都在发信息说：什么时候开始？我说：大概在6、5月份以前，不会超过8月份，美国我认为经济将会出现大问题，快则5、6、7，慢则8月份，不会超过这样。

Then what are people doing now? Internet economy and real estate. How could it be possible? Then, everything will count on the big tech companies, such as Google and Apple. When the whole humanity are walking toward an inflation, how could you survive alone? Can all Americans rely on Tesla and iPhone? Impossible, right? So I mean it will definitely go to hyperinflation. It was last night when they said, “Miles, you are so great. You are so right. The economical decline didn’t result in a major financial crisis.” All of them were sending messages asking when will the crisis start? I said it probably will start by June or May, but not after August. I think the U.S. economy will have big problems. It could be as early as May, June, or July, or as late as August. Not after that.

那么我想给战友说什么？一定要记住兄弟姐妹们，这个时候咱们战友的联合是多么的重要，真遇到世界性和美国大的恶性通胀，导致整个金融市场断崖式的崩盘的时候，我们之间新中国联邦人真的要准备好，互相帮助和互相救助。还有一个要把我们的GTV，G-News、G-Coin、G-Dollar、G-Clubs、G-Fashion，尽快在5月份到6月初，我们要把它进入到一个新的层次，大家开始进行另外一个，我们集体作战在全球。

Then, what do I want to tell my fellow fighters? Please remember, brothers and sister, how important it is for our fellow fighters to unite together at this time. When we encounter big hyperinflation in the world and the U.S., which could lead to a cliff-like crash of the entire financial market, we, people of the NFSC indeed need to be prepared, help each other and assist each other. Additionally, we need to take our G-TV, G-News, G-Coin, G-Dollar, G-Clubs, and G-Fashion into a new level as soon as possible from May to early June. Then, we will fight together globally.

现在大家看到日本，这是我一再给大家说的，日本会硬起来的，日本会硬起来的，日本接下来也会经济一定会出大事。当日本经济出大事的时候，日本会突然发现日本最需要做的就是两个事，这个国家经济上尽可能的远离中共，就经济上远离中共，靠近台湾、韩国、印度，然后是中东的几个先进国家，因为他需要能源嘛，他才能好，但必须远离中共。第二个问题，他会更加要接近，要走向美国欧洲成熟的市场，然后跟我们新中国联邦合作。

Now, everyone is looking at Japan. This is what I told you over and over again. Japan will stand up for sure. Something big will happen regarding Japan’s economy. When that happens, Japan will suddenly find out that there are two most important things for them to do. The first one is to distance itself from the CCP economically as much as possible, yet stay close with Taiwan, South Korea, India, and several developed countries in the Middle East because Japan needs energy. The only way to stay well is to stay away from the CCP. The second one is that Japan will get closer to those mature markets in the U.S. and Europe and then cooperate with our NFSC.

这不是开玩笑，你们觉得我开玩笑。咱走着看。所以说这几天日本的跟我们联系都是，紧锣密鼓，我们十几条战线同时合作。日本现在越来越相信，日本的经济将出大事。欧洲就更不用提了，美国出事，欧洲必须出生事。那日本要出事，美国出事，欧洲要出大事，他们是个命运共同体啊。所以说那就不要提共产党了，港币、人民币就完球蛋了，啥都不会是。

This is not joking. You may think I am kidding, but let’s wait and see. So, these days, people from Japan are contacting with us urgently and cooperating with us on more than a dozen fronts at the same time. Japan is now increasingly believing that major events will happen to the Japanese economy. There is no need to mention Europe because if something happens in the U.S., Europe will surely be influenced. If bad things happen in both Japan and the US, then for sure big things will happen in Europe. They are a community of destiny. Therefore, there is no need to mention the CCP because Hong Kong dollars and RMB will be over and become useless and nothing.

所以兄弟姐妹们，接下来美国的政治上的这种变数和金融市场的必定的断崖式的经济危机，和日本的整个大的金融危机和市场调整，导致美、欧、日、西方文明国家经济重新调整，将走向一个新的时代，从过去的黄金本位到纸币到虚拟货币，然后最重要的是互联网经济，将改变人类的生活方式。G系列还有新中国联邦在这个时候的诞生，必然是上天的安排。没有共产党的未来，就是新中国的未来；没有共产党的新中国，就是新中国联邦的中国。咱不信走走看。

Therefore, brothers and sisters, the uncertainties in the American politics and the destined cliff-like economic crisis in the financial market, as well as the entire financial crisis and market adjustment in Japan will lead to an economic re-arrangement in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Western countries. We will move toward a new era: from the gold standard in the past to paper currency, then to virtual currency. And then, the most important thing is that the Internet economy will change human’s lifestyle. The born of G-series and NFSC at this moment must be the arrangement of God. The future without the CCP is the future of a new China. The new China without the CCP is our NFSC. If you don’t believe it, let’s wait and see.
