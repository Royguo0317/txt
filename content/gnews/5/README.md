新闻简述：在2021年2月25日的盖特视频中，郭先生分析台湾的政治形势，感叹台湾没有真正的政治家，只有投机者，因此虽然有一手好牌，却不会打，把人民天天置于对中共的恐惧之中。在视频结束时他说：“台湾啊，好事也要发生，坏事也要发生。”

**台湾啊，好事也要发生，坏事也要发生**

**Both Good Things and Bad Things Will Happen in Taiwan**

昨天几个台湾的兄弟姐妹给我通话，真是让我老感动了。没想到在台湾的地方，哇噻，有这么强大的爆料革命力量。让我感到非常非常的开心，还是有良知的人，有有脑子的人。但是有些观点我不敢苟同，例如，对蔡总统，小蔡总统，他们的看法是不对的。蔡没那么差，但是她在外交上绝对是一个胆小如鼠，小家子气，她最多能领导一个村吧。但是台湾的现状就是这样，都是政治玩家，没有政治大家。很快台湾人就会感受到，台湾将为政治玩家付出多大的代价。这就是中国人啊，不论任何时候，都不能让政治玩家操纵一个国家。

Yesterday, a few brothers and sisters from Taiwan called me, which really moved me. Wow, I didn’t expect that there exists such a great power of our WM in Taiwan. It made me feel really, really happy to see people with conscience and brains. But some of their viewpoints I can’t quite agree with. For example, about President Tsai, President Little Tsai, their views are mistaken. Tsai is not that bad, but she is definitely a timid and short-sighted in diplomacy. She can only lead a village at most, but the status quo in Taiwan is like this – there are only players of politics but no real masters. Soon people in Taiwan will know how much Taiwan will need to pay for having these players. This is why Chinese should never allow players of politics to control a country.

听说啊，川普总统最近在马阿拉歌也开始看书学习了，也是认真反思了。政治上不能有天真，政治这个东西它是世界上最流氓的游戏，但是他必须还得遵守，服务绝大多数人的规则，否则必将被颠覆。而且你老玩弄手段，玩弄政治技术，你可以政治高度低一点，但你不能老靠玩政治技术，“政妓”是不行的，不是那个政治成绩，是妓女的“妓”，“政妓”不行，或政治“妓术”不行。

I heard that President Trump has recently started reading and studying in Maralago, and also seriously reflecting on what has happened. You cannot be naive in politics. Politics is the most rogue game in the world, but it must still abide by the rules, which serve the vast majority of people, otherwise it will be overthrown for sure. And if you always play with tricks and employ political “skills and techniques”, you can stay at a lower level politically, but you can’t always rely on political skills. Political “prostitutes” are not good. I don’t mean political “achievements” (note: “prostitute” in Chinese is its homophone), I mean prostitutes. You can’t be a political prostitute. Political “prostitution” won’t work.

所以说咱国内的昨天晚上一个哥儿们，给我说一句很精彩的话。他说：不是说中南坑这几个疯子一定要打台湾，让他们千秋万代，是台湾弱到不打他都不好意思。他说实际上台湾人有太多牌，可以对付那几个老杂毛们。这个人是完全是一个很有高度的人，曾经也是可以影响中国命运的人。他说他去过几次台湾，觉得台湾这个地方太好了，他说但是台湾的政客实在是太 low 了。他说就台湾有牌，你可以跟国际上来合作，甚至沼泽地里勾兑也好，你能把自己整得安全一些，没必要像现在这个样子，跪着活，然后天天让人家抽大嘴巴，然后现在还要弄死你，是吧？

So last night, a buddy in mainland China told me something really brilliant. He said that it’s not like that the few lunatics in the Zhongnan Pit must attack Taiwan to keep them on the throne forever; the truth is that it would be too embarrassing if you don’t attack Taiwan because Taiwan is so weak. He said that Taiwanese actually have many good cards to play when dealing with those old bastards [in the Zhongnan Pit]. This person definitely has very high wisdom. He was once a figure who could influence the destiny of China. He said that he had been to Taiwan several times and thought that Taiwan was a great place. He said that Taiwan’s politicians were really too low. He said that Taiwan has cards in their hands to allow them to cooperate with the world, or even collude with the “swamp”. They can make Taiwan a safer place, and there is no need to live like this, sitting on their knees, and allow others [the CCP] to slap their face every day. And now they [the CCP] are even going to kill you, right?

台湾没有人有这感受的，都是一帮投机者。台湾说实在话，不战不归，这是最美好的对台湾，但是不能让大家活在这么恐惧之中啊，那就要有“大家”。从过去这些年看，也就蒋经国和李登辉是个大家，后有陈水扁还是有野心的，现在这些人都不中了。

No one in Taiwan feels this way because they are a bunch of opportunists. To be honest, the best option for Taiwan is “no war, no return”. You can’t let everyone live in such a fear, so you need to have big masters [in politics]. In the past, only Chiang Ching-kuo and Lee Teng-hui were big masters, followed by Chen Shui-bian who had some ambitions, while none of the current people [politicians in Taiwan] has the same guts.

所以说很多台湾战友们给我发来的信息，俺没法一一回哦，没法哦。你看看台湾那些媒体都是一帮垃圾一个个的，什么康啊，什么倩啊，都一帮垃圾都是。你看台湾出过一个在世界上的媒体人吗？一个都没有，一个都没有！台湾人那个小书啊，小诗啊，小历史啊，喃喃自语啊，自淫自乐啊，还仅限于在自己的岛内，是可以的，走出亚洲都走不出去，就甭说世界级的。世界上没有人、没有这些领域，大家啊，宗教领域，是吧？哲学领域，文学领域，世界上最核心的国际政治家，国际外交家一个都没有，他活不成的有，对吧？

Many brothers-in-arms in Taiwan have sent me messages, which I can’t reply one by one. Look at those media people in Taiwan, a bunch of garbage. Kang something and Hsien something are garbage. Have you ever seen one Taiwanese media person who has been well-known in the world? No one, not a single one! Taiwanese authors’ little books, little poems, little history, mumbling-like and self-entertaining stuff are only known within the island, which is fine [within Taiwan], but you can’t even make your works known in the rest of Asia, no mention to become world-class works. There are no Taiwanese known in the world in these fields. There are no real masters in religious fields, philosophy, or literature. There is not a single core international politician or international diplomat in the world, not a living one, right?

但是台湾出了什么？出了很多科技大家，企业家。为什么呀？大家想过没有。中国人的基因，台湾人的基因，是有真正的这种组织能力，实干家。政治高度不行，国际视野更不行，这就是为什么大家你们会很快会看到，台湾很快，今年一定是台湾年，遇到大事的时候，世界上没有几个能帮它的，就是世界上没有几个，没几个。

Then what has Taiwan produced? They have a lot of tech giants, entrepreneurs. Why? Have you thought about it? The genes of the Chinese people, the genes of the Taiwanese have the true organizational ability and doers, but not political wisdom, not mention international visions. This is why very soon you will see that when Taiwan encounters serious problems this year (because this year is “Taiwan year”), few people in the world will help them. Very few.

真替台湾着急啊，但咱没办法，是吧？但咱人少、人笨，然后咱也做不了啥，咱也属于口炮党，没啥，是吧？咱咋能帮人家？咱到时候在台湾挂两口号：“你被北美教练骗了吗？你被郭文贵骗了吗？”咱弄这个吧。台湾啊，好事也要发生，坏事也要发生，是吧？

I really worry about Taiwan, but what can we do, right? We don’t have the manpower and we are not that smart, and we can’t do anything other than talking, right? How can we help them? We will put up two slogans in Taiwan at that time: “Have you been cheated by the “North American coach” (referred to Miles)? Have you been cheated by Miles Guo?” Let’s do this. Taiwan, some good things will happen to them, and bad things will happen too, right?
