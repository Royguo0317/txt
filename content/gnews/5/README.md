#### **Justice Department Sues Yale University for Illegal Discrimination Practices in Undergraduate Admissions**

#### **司法部起訴耶魯大學在本科招生中存在非法歧視行為**

**Race Discrimination Against Applicants to Yale College Violates Federal Civil Rights Law**

**耶魯學院對其申請者的種族歧視違反聯邦民權法**

The Justice Department today filed suit against Yale University for race and national origin discrimination. The complaint alleges that Yale discriminated against applicants to Yale College on the grounds of race and national origin, and that Yale’s discrimination imposes undue and unlawful penalties on racially-disfavored applicants, including in particular most Asian and White applicants.

司法部今天就耶魯大學的種族和民族歧視提起訴訟。起訴稱，耶魯大學以種族和民族為由歧視耶魯大學的申請人，耶魯大學的歧視行為對受到種族歧視的申請人施加了不適當和非法的處罰，其中大多數是亞裔和白人申請人。

The complaint also alleges that Yale injures applicants and students because Yale’s race discrimination relies upon and reinforces damaging race-based stereotypes, including in particular such stereotypes against Yale’s racially-favored applicants. And, the complaint alleges that Yale engages in racial balancing by, among other things, keeping the annual percentage of African-American admitted applicants to within one percentage point of the previous year’s admitted class as reflected in U.S. Department of Education data. The complaint alleges similar racial balancing about Asian-American applicants.

起訴還稱，耶魯大學傷害了申請者和學生，因為耶魯大學的種族歧視基於並強化了有破壞性的種族定型觀念，其中特別是那些針對耶魯大學種族偏好的申請者的刻板印象。而且，起訴稱，耶魯大學進行種族平衡，除其他事項外，據美國教育部資料反映出來，耶魯大學將每年被錄取的非裔美國人申請者的比例與上一年錄取率保持在1%以內。起訴書稱，對亞裔美國人申請者也存在類似的種族平衡。

The department’s complaint alleges that Yale’s race and national origin discrimination violate Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The lawsuit is the result of a multi-year investigation into allegations of illegal discrimination contained in a complaint filed by Asian American groups concerning Yale’s conduct.

司法部的起訴稱，耶魯大學的種族和民族歧視違反了1964年《民權法》第六章。該訴訟是多年調查的結果，調查了亞裔美國人對耶魯大學行為的投訴中提及的非法歧視指控。

“Illegal race discrimination by colleges and universities must end,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division. “This nation’s highest ideals include the notion that we are all equal under the law. For centuries, people from all over the world have learned of this ideal, left their ancestral homes, and come to the United States hoping that this country would live up to its ideals and that they and their families could enjoy equal opportunity and pursue the American dream. Countless Americans have pursued their dreams through higher education, and they continue to do so. All persons who apply for admission to colleges and universities should expect and know that they will be judged by their character, talents, and achievements and not the color of their skin. To do otherwise is to permit our institutions to foster stereotypes, bitterness, and division.”

“高校的非法種族歧視必須停止，”民權司的助理司法部長Eric Dreiband說，”這個國家的最高理想就包含法律面前人人平等的理念。幾個世紀以來，來自世界各地的人們瞭解到了這一理想，離開家園，來到美國，希望這個國家能夠實現其理想，希望他們和他們的家人能夠享受平等的機會，並追求美國夢。無數美國人通過接受高等教育來追求自己的夢想，而且他們還在繼續這樣做。所有申請進入高校的人都應該期望並知道，高校將根據申請者的品格、才能和成績而不非膚色來判斷。如果不這樣做，就會讓我們的機構滋生成見、怨恨和分裂。”。

As a condition of receiving millions of dollars in taxpayer funding, Yale expressly agrees to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a cornerstone civil-rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance.  According to the complaint, Yale receives over $600 million annually in federal funds.

作為獲得納稅人數百萬美元資金的條件之一，耶魯大學明確同意遵守1964年《民權法》第六章，這是民權法的基石，該法禁止在接受聯邦財政援助的項目和活動中存在種族、膚色或民族歧視。 起訴書稱，耶魯大學每年獲得超過6億聯邦資金支持。

Title VI provides in part, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, … be subjected to discrimination under any program … receiving Federal financial assistance.”  The U.S. Supreme Court repeatedly has struck down discriminatory admissions programs in higher education, and required such programs to be narrowly tailored and not unduly to burden innocent applicants in order to survive. Yale’s practices violate the law.

第六章部分規定：”在美國，任何人不得以種族、膚色或國籍為由……在接受聯邦財政援助的任何專案中…..受到歧視。” 美國最高法院多次否決高等教育中的歧視性招生計畫，並要求這種計畫必須是狹義的，不能給無辜的申請者造成過重的負擔，以便生存。耶魯的做法已違反該法律。

The Justice Department found Yale discriminates based on race and national origin in its undergraduate admissions process, and that race is the determinative factor in hundreds of admissions decisions each year. For the great majority of applicants, Asian Americans and Whites have only one-eighth to one-fourth of the likelihood of admission as African American applicants with comparable academic credentials. Yale rejects scores of Asian American and White applicants each year based on their race, whom it otherwise would admit.

司法部發現，耶魯大學在本科生錄取過程中存在種族和民族歧視，在每年數百個錄取決定中，種族是決定性因素。對於絕大多數申請者來說，亞裔美國人和白人的錄取率只有學業相當的非裔美國申請者的八分之一到四分之一。耶魯大學每年都會因種族問題拒絕大量亞裔美國人和白人申請申請者，否則就會錄取他們。

Although the Supreme Court has held that colleges receiving federal funds may consider applicants’ race in certain limited circumstances as one of a number of factors, the Department of Justice found Yale’s use of race is anything but limited. Yale uses race at multiple steps of its admissions process resulting in a multiplied effect of race on an applicant’s likelihood of admission. And Yale racially balances its classes.

雖然最高法院認為，領受聯邦資金的大學可以在某些限定條件下將申請人的種族作為若干因素之一加以考慮，但司法部發現耶魯大學使用種族因素毫無限制。耶魯大學在招生的多個步驟中使用種族因素，導致種族因素對申請人是否被錄取產生數倍影響。同時，耶魯大學對班級進行種族平衡。

Yale refused to agree to the Department of Justice’s demand that Yale refrain from using race or national origin in its current 2020-2021 undergraduate admissions cycle. Yale also failed or refused ever to end its use of race in admissions, and Yale declined even to propose any changes to its pervasive use of race. The department therefore notified Yale that efforts at voluntary compliance had failed and filed suit.

耶魯大學拒絕接受司法部要求，即要求耶魯大學在目前2020-2021年本科生錄取中限制使用種族或民族出身。耶魯大學也未能或拒絕停止在招生中使用種族，耶魯大學甚至拒絕對其普遍使用種族的做法提出任何修改建議。因此，司法部通知耶魯大學自願遵守的努力已失敗，並提起訴訟。
