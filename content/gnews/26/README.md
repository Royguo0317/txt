Senator Mitch McConnell:

Over the last four years, our country has benefited from a presidential term filled with major accomplishments. President Donald Trump has repeatedly surprised the skeptics, confounded his critics and delivered significant policy victories that have strengthened our country.

在过去的四年里，我们的国家从一个充满重大成就的总统任期中获益匪浅。唐纳德·川普总统不断使怀疑者感到惊讶，使他的批评者感到困惑，并做出了重大的政策胜利，使我们的国家更加强大。

Case in point, back in May when the president set the goal of finding a pandemic-ending vaccine by the end of this year, his timeline was literally dismissed by people who assumed they knew better. Here was one quote: “Trump promises coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year,” is scoffed, one headline, but his own experts temper expectations. “Fact-check,” complained another headline. “‘Coronavirus could come this year,’ Trump says. Experts say, ‘Needs a miracle to be right.’”

举个例子，早在五月份，当总统设定了在今年年底前找到能够结束疫情的疫苗的目标的时候，他的时间表实际上就被那些以为自己知道得更多的人所轻视。引用其中的一句：“川普承诺在今年年底前推出新冠病毒疫苗”，这句话被嗤之以鼻，（成为）头条新闻，但是他自己的专家却降低了期望。“事实审查”，另一个头条新闻抱怨道。川普说：“今年可能会有新冠病毒”。专家们说：“不会是真的，除非奇迹发生”。

Well, with the genius of science, support from Congress and the bold leadership of the Trump administration, that medical miracle arrived right on schedule. Americans on the front lines are receiving vaccinations as we speak. This episode offers a kind of microcosm of the last four years on so many subjects, from economic prosperity to foreign policy to protecting American families. The skeptics doubted him. The critics derided him, but President Trump has delivered.

好吧，凭借科学的天赋、国会的支持以及川普政府的大胆领导，那个医疗奇迹如期而至。正如我们所讲，前线的美国人们正在接受疫苗接种。这段情节提供了过去四年中许多主题的缩影，从经济繁荣到外交政策再到保护美国家庭。怀疑论者怀疑他，批评者们嘲笑他，但是川普总统给予了他们打击。

When President Trump ran for office, he promised to help open a new chapter for working families. After eight years of failed policies that concentrated wealth and optimism among the lucky few, prosperity was going to flow to all kinds of workers, in all kinds of communities, he said, and that’s exactly what happened.

当川普总统竞选公职时，他承诺要帮助工薪家庭打开一个新的篇章。他说，在八年为幸运的少数人集中财富和乐观的失败的政策之后，繁荣将流至各个社区的各种工人，这就是事实。

Before this pandemic spread from China and the world had to slam on the brakes, the American people had the best job market in living memory. With help from the policies of President Trump and Republicans in Congress, American workers dynamited the stagnation that experts had said was the new normal.

在这场由中国乃至世界蔓延的疫情不得不刹车之前，美国人民拥有记忆中最佳的就业市场。在川普总统和共和党在国会的政策的帮助下，美国工人们宣告专家所说的停滞不前是新常态。

Unemployment hit a 50 year low. Capital markets hit record highs. At this time, all kinds of Americans got to share in the gains. We saw earnings grow faster for workers then for managers, faster for the bottom 25 than for the top 25. This success was fueled in part by the policy leadership of President Trump.

失业率达50年以来最低。资本市场创历史新高。同时，所有的美国人都必须分享收益。我们看到工人的收入增长速度快于经理的收入增长，后25名的增长速度高于前25名的收入增长。这一成功，在一定程度上受到了川普总统的政策领导的推动。

This administration pursued bold regulatory changes. Once-in-a-generation tax reform had alluded prior leaders, this president signed it into law in his first year. And together, we repealed the worst part of Obamacare, the unfair individual mandate was zeroed out.

这届政府实行了大胆的法规改革。以前的领导人们曾被暗示过一代人的税制改革，这位总统在他就职的第一年就将其签署成法律。同时，我们废除了奥巴马医改中最糟糕的部分，取消了不公平的个人任务。

President Trump also took historic steps to strengthen the future of our trade with the world. He secured the historic United States’ Mexico-Canada Agreement and the bilateral tax treaties with partners in Europe and in Asia.

川普总统还采取了历史性的措施来加强未来我们与世界的贸易。他与欧洲和亚洲的合作伙伴签订了具有历史意义的《美国-墨西哥-加拿大协定》和双边税收协定。

A nation this productive needs plenty of energy to keep it going. Fortunately, President Trump and his administration ended the ideological war on fossil fuels and hit the accelerator on all-of-the-above American energy dominance. In the last four years, we suppressed Saudi Arabia in oil production. We saw energy exports exceed energy imports for the first year in almost 70 years. Meanwhile, we saw CO2 emissions fall, along with other harmful pollutants. That energy independence dramatically strengthened our hand with respect to the rest of the world, particularly the Middle East.

如此多产的一个国家需要大量的能源来维持。幸运的是，川普总统和他的政府结束了化石燃料领域的意识形态战争，并加速了所有美国能源的主导地位。在过去的四年里，我们压制了沙特阿拉伯的石油产量。我们看到，在过去70年里，能源出口第一年超过能源进口。同时，我们看到二氧化碳排放量以及其他有害污染物的排放量也在下降。能源独立极大地增强了我们对世界其他地区，尤其是中东的力量。

So speaking of the Middle East, President Trump wasted little time pulling back from the prior administration’s disastrous Iran deal. His team eliminated daylight between us and Israel, and repaired our relationship with Arab partners. And he aligned these relationships around our common shared interests, countering threats like radical Islamic terrorists and Iranian aggression.

说到中东，川普总统没怎么浪费时间就撤回了上届政府灾难性的伊朗协议。他的团队消除了我们与以色列的开隙，修复了我们与阿拉伯伙伴的关系。而且，他围绕我们共同的利益调整这些关系，以应对激进的伊斯兰恐怖分子和伊朗侵略等威胁。

Under President Trump’s command, our forces took terrorist leaders like al-Baghdadi and Soleimani off the battlefield. The physical caliphate that ISIS established on the previous presidents watch was destroyed. All of this paved the way for the Abraham Accords, the historic normalization of relationships between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and most recently, Morocco, and the potential is there for more on the horizon.

在川普总统的指挥下，我们的部队把像al-Baghdadi和 Soleimani这样的恐怖分子领导人带离战场。 ISIS在前任总统监督下建立的哈里发实体被摧毁。所有这些为亚伯拉罕协议铺平了道路，为以色列与阿联酋、巴林、苏丹以及最近的摩洛哥之间的关系实现正常化铺平了道路，而且潜力无限。

Now, the Middle East isn’t the only place where the Trump administration has shored up our footing on the world stage. Our 45th commander-in-chief set out to rebuild and modernize our military and to move our foreign policy from a chapter of weakness on apology into a renewed posture of strength.

现在，中东不是川普政府在世界舞台上立足的唯一地方。我们的第45任总司令开始重建和现代化我们的军队，并将我们的外交政策从道歉的软弱时期转变为一种新的强势姿态。

Four years later, we have a new national defense strategy to complete with and deter adversaries like Russia and China. We have rebuilt the military and invested in new technologies to ensure America keeps our edge in everything from cyber to space to advanced weapons systems. And the president’s leadership has not stopped with those who are currently serving. He also signed into law the historic VA MISSION Act to ensure our dedication to the men and women in uniform does not end when their tours conclude.

四年之后，我们制定了新的国家防御战略，以完成和阻止像俄罗斯和中国这样的对手。我们已经重建了军队，并投入了新科技以确保美国在从网络到太空再到先进武器系统的所有领域中都保持优势。总统的领导层并没有停止于目前的在职人员。他还签署了具有历史意义的《 VA MISSION Act》，以确保我们对身穿制服的男女的奉献在他们任职结束时仍旧存在。

So clearly, Madam President, the list of American accomplishments since 2016 is nearly endless. There are the many miles of new protections on our Southern border. At one point, apprehensions at the border hit their lowest level since the 1970s. The central causes like religious liberty and the most vulnerable, the unborn, have had a champion in this administration, instead of an adversary. There have been historic new steps to conserve our national treasures, like the Great American Outdoors Act.

所以，非常明显，主席女士，自从2016年以来，总统的功绩数不胜数。我们南部边界上有许多英里的新保护区。一方面，边界恐惧达到了1970年以来的最低水平。宗教自由和最脆弱的人（未出生的人）等核心原因在本届政府中拥有拥护者，而不是对手。有一些历史性的新步骤可以保护我们的国家财富，比如《大美国户外法案》。

And perhaps most important of all, President Trump nominated and the Senate confirmed three outstanding Supreme Court justices, along with more than 220 more Article 3 federal judges. These are brilliant, young constitutionalists, men and women in lifetime appointments who will renew the judiciary for a generation, all because President Trump knows we need judges who respect the essential but limited job description the framers wrote for our third branch of government.

也许最重要的一点是，川普总统提名且参议员确认了三名杰出的最高法院法官，以及220多名联邦终身法官（Article 3 federal judges）。他们都才华横溢，是年轻的立宪主义者。终身任命的人们将使司法机构更新一代人，这都是因为川普总统知道我们需要尊重制宪者为我们第三政府部门撰写的基本但有限的职位描述的法官。

As you can see, Madam President, it would take far more than one speech to catalog all the major wins the Trump administration has helped deliver for the American people. The outsider who swore he would shake up Washington and lead our country to new accomplishments, both at home and abroad, proceeded to do exactly that. President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence deserve our thanks and our gratitude for their tireless work and their essential roles in all these victories, and in many more.

正如您所知，主席女士，仅仅一次演讲不能一一列举川普政府为美国人们带来的所有重大的胜利。那个宣誓将要动摇华盛顿并带领我们的国家在国内外取得新成就的局外人，正在着手做到这一点。川普总统和副总统迈克·彭斯值得我们感谢，因为他们在所有这些胜利中（不仅仅这些胜利中）所做的不懈的工作和发挥的重要作用。

Six weeks ago, Americans voted in this year’s general election. The legal and constitutional processes have continued to play out since then. Yesterday, electors met in all 50 states. As of this morning, our country has officially a president-elect and a vice president-elect. Many millions of us had hoped the presidential election would yield a different result, but our system of government has processes to determine who will be sworn in on January the 20th. The electoral college has spoken.

六周前，美国人为今年的大选投票。从那以后，法律和宪法程序一直在继续。昨天，选民在所有50个州举行了会议。截至今天上午，我们的国家有一个正式总统当选人和副总统当选人。我们中的数百万人曾希望总统大选会产生不同的结果，但是我们的政府系统具有确定谁将在1月20日宣誓就职的程序。选举团已经表明了是谁。

Today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden. The president-elect is no stranger to the Senate. He’s devoted himself to public service for many years. I also want to congratulate the vice-president-elect, our colleague from California, Senator Harris. Beyond our differences, all Americans can take pride that our nation has a female vice-president-elect for the very first time. I look forward to finishing out the next 36 days strong with President Trump. Our nation needs us to add another bipartisan chapter to this record of achievement.

今天，我要祝贺当选总统乔·拜登。当选总统对参议院来讲不是稀奇的事情。他致力于公共服务多年。我还想祝贺副总统当选人，我们来自加利福尼亚州的同事，哈里斯参议员。除了我们的分歧以外，所有的美国人都可以为我们的国家第一次有一位女性副总统当选人而感到自豪。我期待在接下来的36天与川普总统取得良好的合作（以结束其任期）。我们的国家需要我们在这一成就记录上再添两党的一章。
