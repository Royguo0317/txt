在2020年10月5日的[G-TV直播](https://gtv.org/?videoid=5f7b2c9b7de25667c0dfee09)中，郭先生對爆料革命（WM）某些戰友們（BIAs）妄加評論川普總統的行為表示不滿並敦促戰友停止批評川普總統和美國，集中精力採取更多行動支持爆料革命 。 郭先生說：


> 只要是爆料革命的戰友，我們不要對別人批評，我們不依靠別人，不批評別人，不辱駡別人，這是起碼的一個基本規則。



> 國與國是有規矩的。…你對美國的政治起碼的瞭解都沒有。絕對不可能(說打就打了): 計畫，準備，立法，這些都在進行中。但是，這就是美國的脆弱和美國的偉大。




#### **To WM BIAs: Stop Criticizing Pres. Trump & Rely on Ourselves**

#### **致爆料革命的戰友們：請不要再批評川普總統；要依靠自己多付諸行動**！

Now let’s go back to President Trump. Quite a few BIAs commenting on the internet, “Pres. Trump, you’ve been hesitant about taking down the CCP. Why don’t you hurry up sending drones over, going for a decapitation strike?” “Oh, Pres. Trump, it’s about time that you take some action!” BIAs, this hurts my heart so much as it hurts Pres. Trump’s. The most terrible person in the world is like: Big-head syndrome [foolish & pompous]! A gladiator of empty talks! A person who fails at every aspect, and yet tries to command others every day. A run-of-the-mill and yet wants to command Pres. Trump every day.

我再說川普總統，還有很多戰友在網路上：啊，川普總統，你這個不滅共，你趕快派無人機，趕快定點爆破。啊，川普總統，這回你該行動了。戰友們，這樣同樣在傷著文貴的心。我覺得這個世界上最可怕的就是這個人呐，大腦袋症！舌頭上的巨人，自己啥球幹不成，天天指揮別人，天天指揮別人。一個普通人，天天指揮川普總統。

We are from the most failed nation. We are the most defeated losers. Why didn’t you stay back in China? Why don’t you take on the CCP yourself? What makes you qualified to command Pres. Trump? When I saw some BIAs’ criticizing Pres. Trump, my heart was wrenching!What makes you qualified to demand or command Pres. Trump? BIAs, have you even asked yourself – Are you really that capable & smart thatyou get to give Pres Trump orders? The audacity that you feel so angry, so disappointed!Give me a break!Suit yourself, who cares if you feel disappointed! Show me some of your actions?!

我們是最失敗的國家來的，我們是最失敗的loser，我們為啥不在中國？你咋不找中國共產黨幹去呀？你憑啥指揮人家川普總統啊？我看到當有戰友在那兒批評川普總統的時候，我心都碎了。你憑啥要求人家？你憑啥指揮人家？戰友們，你有沒有問過自己，你有什麼樣的腦子和能力和智慧，你來指揮川普總統！你生氣，你失望，去你的球吧，你愛去哪兒失望去哪兒失望去。你的行動呢？

If you are a true brother-in-arms (BIA), please stop criticizing others like that. Do not rely on other people, do not criticize or scold others. This is a fundamental principle. What is President Trump doing right now? You’d think that once back to WH, he’d immediately start wiping out the CCP?Impossible, unless he had gone mad. The CCP has held 1.4 billion people hostages, 1/6 of the world population. Would you think this is as simple as acting on impulse? Would that be possible? He is the \*President\*; he would become a terrorist if he were to act like that.

只要是爆料革命的戰友，我們不要對別人批評，我們不依靠別人，不批評別人，不辱駡別人，這是起碼的一個基本規則。人家川普總統現在幹啥？你以為他回到白宮就滅共去，不可能！除非他是瘋了。共產黨綁架了14億中國人，地球的六分之一。你覺得說打就打了？那可能嗎？那是川普總統，（說打就打）成了恐怖分子了都。

Protocols have to be followed between two countries!First, the Americans always put national security and interestsas the foremost priority. Second, this is an election year for Pres. Trump; so everything shall be election-oriented. If he loses the election, he’d be a nobody; worse, he might be taken out by others. Everything he does, it’s gotta be for the sake of the election. Third, even if he were to go for it, his words alone don’t count! He is not Xi Jinping, nor Gaddafi. Some of us do not even have the basic knowledge of US politics. He cannot just go for it! It takes planning, preparation, legislations, of which all are under the way…This is the fragility of America, albeit, the greatness of America. Ever since the CCP released the virus, the origins were [misled] from snakes to pangolins, to caves in Yunnan, to space…They almost have exhausted the names of all animals. Also, they blamed on the American soldiers.

他是，國與國是有規矩的。第一，人家美國人要以美國國家安全和利益為主。第二，川普總統正在大選，一切都是大選。他輸了大選什麼都不是，他可能被人幹掉，他一切都為大選。第三，即使他想幹，他也一個人說了不算，他不是習近平，他不是卡紮菲。你對美國的政治起碼的瞭解都沒有。絕對不可能。計畫，準備，立法，這些都在進行中。但是，這就是美國的脆弱和美國的偉大。共產黨從病毒一出來，從蛇到穿山甲，到雲南山洞，到太空，到所有的動物，都已經用完了，美國軍人什麼的。

Even by now, the U.S. hasn’t said a word officially. Why haven’t they made official announcement about the origins? First, evidence. Second, the facts [need to be verified]. Third, it has to go through a procedure. Fourth, must be responsible to the society, including your speeches, your talks, your definitions. This is the fundamental difference between the CCP and the U.S. So it is not up to the President to give the verdict. If someone just wants to frame another, would it be that easy? The slow-in-response and indecisiveness that you’re concerned about actually is the greatness of the U.S.

美國到今天官方，沒說出一句來，這東西來自哪裡。官方一句不說，為什麼？第一要講證據。第二要有事實。第三要經過程式。第四，必須要對社會負責，你的演講，你的說話，你的定義。這就是中共和美國的不同啊。不是你總統你想說是誰就是誰的，你想栽贓就去栽贓，可能嗎？即使你擔心的所謂的慢呐，不（下定）決心呐，這也是人家美國的偉大。

Mr. Giuliani sat down with me and spoke about 4 hrs last week. The elderly gentleman wrote meticulously, and verified with people word by word. He is in his seventies. An U.S. military personnel also was verifying word by word. You may think this is too low-tech (dumb), too cumbersome. More so, they will re-verify after one month. This is about respecting the facts. Isn’t this what should pursue? We now expect all mankind to fight this righteous war for us. But what have we done, BIAs? What have we done? I’ve gone through many things since I returned from the boat. Too many events. I cannot reveal now. I really feel that the US is just so great! So, so great!I interacted with dozens of people from different industries daily. These Americans are realistic, civilized, respectful, professional, and law-abiding. Too much for us Chinese to fathom even!

人家朱利安尼，在上星期，人家坐在這兒跟我說話的時候，4個小時，人家老人家一紙一筆的寫東西，一個字兒一個字兒的跟你核對，也是七十幾歲的老人了。人家某個美國的軍方的人士，一個字兒一個字兒的核對。你可能覺得太笨了，太囉嗦了，一個月後人還要跟你核對。這就是人家尊重事實，這難道不是我們追求的嗎？我們現在期望著全人類替我們打正義之仗，我們幹了啥？戰友們。我們做了啥？我這經歷太多事兒了，我從船上下來到（現在），經歷太多事兒了。現在我不要講。我真是感覺美國這個國家太偉大太偉大太偉大了。我每天跟這幾十個人在一起，不同行業的人，就這個國家務實，文明，尊重，專業，守法，是我們中國人真的是完全不懂的。

What’s happening among us Chinese now shows utter ignorance of the world. The devastating consequences of ignorance of civilization and humanity. Of course, the core issue is the absence of faith. Please do not criticize Pres. Trump any more, don’t say “wish”, don’t say “expect”. None of us is qualified to do that. Whatever President Trump does is his business. Whatever the U.S. does is their business.

我們中國人現在發生的這一系列事情，就是對世界的無知，對文明和人性的無視導致的嚴重後果。當然了，核心原因是沒有信仰。這是（對）川普總統，不要批評，不要希望，不要指望，沒資格，我們。川普總統做什麼，是他的事情。美國做什麼，是他們的事情。

Our strategy of leveraging the CCP to destroy the CCP, leveraging the U.S. to destroy the CCP, shall never change! And, leveraging law to destroy the CCP. I’ve never counted on the Americans to take out the CCP for us. Never have I believed in that. I always believe in that in the end, the one who ends the CCP is none other than the CCP itself. Haven’t all realized that by now? The arrests of [the once-glorified]Dong Hong, Meng Jianzhu, and Sun Lijun, the house arrest of Wang Qishan, and the arrests of millions of the CCP cadres… The collapse of the Chinese economy, food shortages, the madness of the whole society, and the Great Firewall, do you honestly think this country can keep going like this? Every moment some type of revolution is to erupt, ensuing bloodshed, in other words, an internal political riot.

我們以共滅共，以美滅共，永遠不變，以法滅共。我從不相信美國人幫我們把共產黨給滅了，我從來不相信。我所有的，我認為滅共產黨的，一定是共產黨。大家難道沒看到嗎？董宏的被抓，孟建柱的被抓，孫立軍的被抓，王岐山的被軟禁，百萬黨員的被抓，中國經濟的崩盤，糧食的短缺，全社會的現在的瘋狂和網路的封鎖，你覺得這個國家還能繼續下去麼？下一秒鐘都可能是變成革命，流血，或者說是內部政治暴亂。

If we still have a bit of conscience, we shall not criticize the U.S.!”People have died in the U.S.”, “The U.S. economy is being held hostage!””The U.S. is BGY’ed (corrupt and threatened by extortions)!”It’s up to the Americans to make a decision! Why would you be so worried? The emperor is in no rush; and yet the eunuch [castrated person] is more keen than him!I plead to all BIAs, it you \*truly\* are our brother-in-arms, stop talking nonsense, stop criticizing [the U.S.] so recklessly! This has made such a negative impact to our WM (Whistleblower Movement)!

美國人，我們但凡有一點兒良知的，都不要去批評美國。美國它死人了，美國經濟受到綁架了，美國被藍金黃了，人家做決定！你幹嘛著急啊？皇帝不急你急啥呀？一個太監你急什麼呀？我求求了，只要是戰友的，不要再在那兒塊兒放胡話，放厥詞，這對我們爆料革命影響非常之差。
