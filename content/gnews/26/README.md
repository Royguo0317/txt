## 没有中国老百姓能在中共统治下保住财富
` Himalaya Rose Garden Team` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/1023489/)

简述：郭先生在2021年3月9日的盖特视频中说，对于中国大陆的普通人来讲，期望从中共控制的市场经济中获利并保住财富无异于白日做梦。中共国的市场经济是习、江等黑帮家族的较量战场。任何中共几大家族以外的人都无法摆脱中共的最后掠夺，比如马明哲、马云，而帮中共在新疆杀人的刽子手，王震家族却可以在海外保住财富。大家不要天真，也不要贪婪。

**没有中国老百姓能在中共统治下保住财富**

**No Ordinary Chinese Can Make A Fortune from A CCP-Controlled Market**

昨天晚上我相信国内最多的、最大的问题是国内两件事情。这个确实在我们预料之中，但是也超出了我们的预料之外。就是国内的上海股市，还有几个大的金融机构几个大的烂账，还有几个大的经济指标，都超出了我们的想象，这太可怕了。

I believe last night in mainland China, two significant events received the most attention. We knew they were going to happen, but their influences still exceeded our estimation. In mainland China, what happened in the Shanghai stock market, in several large financial institutions with bad debts, and the economic indicators were all beyond our imagination. It was so horrible.

这个家伙割韭菜，割了多少人的钱啊？多少人的钱啊，兄弟姐妹们？所以说咱们有些战友他穷不是因为他不劳动，也不是因为他不勤劳，是因为这个脑子，还有贪婪的出了问题。就是说，在共产党的这个“擀面杖”的经济下，你竟然能做梦想着有五倍、十倍的回报，你想的银行的存款比你挣钱快，你想着竟然股市上有你赚钱的机会，那你这不就完蛋了嘛，你多勤劳，你也白干啊，干一万年，还不如一下子搞错误的，就把你钱给弄走了呐，对吧？

Do you know how many people’s money has been looted, brothers and sisters? Some of our fellow fighters are in poverty, not because they don’t work or they are not hard-working, it is because they cannot see through the delusions, and are so greedy that things go wrong for them. In the CCP’s counterfeit and deceptive economy market, which is called “a rolling pin economy”, can you even dream of getting 5 or 10 times return on your investment? Do you think that bank deposit profits are better than earning money by yourself? Do you believe that you have a chance to make money in the stock market? If you think so, you are screwed. No matter how hard you work, you are destined to be poor. No matter how hard you work, one mistake will completely destroy you, making you lose all your money. Right?

另外一个在香港，很多金融产品全爆仓，像汇丰的，很多都爆仓。为什么大家要看到，只有平安股上涨？平安股的背后还是王岐山，平安股的背后还是中南坑，这真的叫操作，操作也叫控制，这叫做真正的金融犯罪，也就叫割韭菜。但是平安这个股市随时上涨，陆金锁干掉蚂蚁金服，我很早两三年前讲过陆金锁干掉蚂蚁金服，这是权贵干掉你真正的私人企业家，人家真正的北京帮，人家控制权力的帮，习大神干你江泽民在野党，在野党是什么呀？蚂蚁金服，马云。人家的实质权控制党，中南坑、习大神、王岐山，是平安陆金锁，这你显示出来了吧？

In Hong Kong, many financial investment products are forced to liquidate due to insufficient margin, for example many financial products of HSBC. Why was PingAn stock the only one going up? You should realize that the power behind the PingAn stock is still Wang Qishan and the Zhongnan Pit. The stock is being controlled and manipulated. It indeed is a financial crime for robbing the wealth of investors, called “cutting the chives”. We are seeing the rise of PingAn stock’s price and the surpassing of Ant Financial Services by Lufax, which I talked about two or three years ago. At that time, I said that Lufax would devour Ant Financial Services. This is the privileged class plundering private entrepreneurs. The Beijing gang led by God Xi (Xi Jinping), which is in power now, has began the fight against their adversary parties, which are led by Jiang Zemin. Who are Xi’s opponents? Jack Ma and Ant Financial Services. The real power controlling the party and the Zhongnan Pit belongs to God Xi and Wang Qishan, and PingAn Lufax is theirs. So, it is becoming more self-evident, right?

所以在中国没有什么能力赚钱，只有你这个白手套在什么时间内你赚钱，但最终马明哲，记住我今天说的话，我第一次告诉你们，他比马云还得惨，他比马云还得惨100倍。记住啊，我曾经听过原话，就是原来王岐山大马仔董宏，抓起来的董宏，他说过：你记住，抓马明哲那天的时候，就像当年乾隆抓和珅一样，会被他连根带啥都给他拨起来，而且一定会到了不管谁，你一定会的，任何一个人抓你平安的时候，就抓了一个宝，抓了个金藏，是吧？一定的。我跟马明哲没任何个人恩怨，没有任何，这个人见面还说我未来，说我这长相，我的相貌，说未来要做赌博的话能赚万亿的钱，富可敌国，每次都瞎喷，是吧？瞎忽悠，这是他们的本质。当然还给我相面，我给他相面，我得相八辈面，是吧？

There is no opportunity for ordinary people (Lao Bai Xing) to earn significant wealth through their own effort in China. You are only allowed to temporarily hold the wealth for the privileged during a certain period of time. Please mark my words today, which I have never told you before: Eventually, Ma Mingzhe will be more than 100 times worse off than Jack Ma. Fellow fighters, please keep that in mind. I once heard Dong Hong, a major running dog of Wang Qishan who has been arrested now, saying that when arresting Ma Mingzhe, it will be like the time when Emperor Qianlong arrested Heshen, taking away all his money and uprooting his whole network. No matter who intervenes, it will happen for sure. Whoever seized PingAn will be like holding a gold mine, right? Absolutely. I don’t have any personal grudge with Ma Mingzhe. When we met, he always said something like by looking at my face, he knew that I could make trillions dollars and my wealth would be comparable to that of a country’s if I got involved in the gambling business. All bullshits, right? Talking with foolishness and nonsense is the nature of people like him. And he told my fortune by reading my face? I daresay I would be more accurate at predicting his future and I could even tell all his past, present, and future life, right?

那么另外一个就是，我很惊讶，我非常惊讶，在这次上海股票的这个血洗当中，有很多我们战友被洗光了。还有一个，可能战友们你们不知道，有一个人通过我们的系统，战友吧，换了大概200多亿欧元，海外给欧元，100多亿美元，在国内给人民币，在国内做这种逆向操作，全光，全赔光。我从没见过一个人在大陆共产党的手里面，能赚过多少倍钱，安安全全拿开的，从来没有过，都是账，都是算的账。有些事情绝不是我们草根儿能碰的。

I was stunned that many of our fellow fighters lost their money in the bloody looting of the Shanghai stock market. There is one thing that our fellow fighters may not know yet. One fellow fighter exchanged about 20 billion Euros for RMB through our channel, equivalent to more than 10 billion U.S. dollars, by giving Euros overseas and receiving RMB at home. He did this kind of reverse operation on the Shanghai stock market, and lost everything. Never have I seen a person who can earn many times more return from his investment on a CCP controlled market, and successfully realize that return. The best case is to record a paper profit, which would be just a number in an account. The CCP completely isolates the good things from the grassroots.

在中国这个真正的江湖的政治里面，也叫沼泽地的政治里面，在中国100%的沼泽地大佬控制的经济领域，草根儿想赚大钱，你暂时拥有的控制权、保管权，最后都得还回去。任何人，从乡村到北京，到中南坑，只有那几个家族是永恒的。就像那个中信的王军，王军死后，中南坑下令，王军的海外财富，继续保护，为什么？王震杀了新疆人。这就是共产党，他们那几个杀人的魔王，他们是一伙的，我们草根儿是被杀的，永远和你对立的，你的钱早晚得还给他们。你在手里搁一搁可以，你想拥有，你想花掉它，你想使用它，不中。

How can the Lao Bai Xing make big money when the economy and market are 100% controlled by the bigwigs in the CCP’s swamp? Even if you can temporarily hold the money, you will still have to hand it back to them in the end. Whether you are from the countryside, Beijing, or the Zhongnan Pit, only the very few families can have everlasting win in China. An example is Wang Jun, the former chairman of CITIC Group. After his death, the Zhongnan Pit ordered the continued protection of Wang Jun’s overseas wealth. Why? Because his father, Wang Zhen, suppressed and killed people in Xinjiang for the CCP. These murderous devils belong to the same gang, which is the CCP. Lao Bai Xing are the target to be slaughtered. Lao Bai Xing and the CCP are always opposed. Sooner or later, they will take your money. Maybe you are allowed to hold the money in your hands for a while, but there is no way that you can own the money, spend the money or use the money according to your will.

这就是中共邪恶的地方，我们要灭他的地方。兄弟姐妹们不要天真了，还 hold 着房子呢，多少人呢，你将死在这种贪婪和无知的名下。中国有个房子住住就行了，你想指望它发财？想传承万代？你见过全世界有一个房子盖在不属于你的地上的吗？就像你的孩子，在别人肚子里面长出来的，他能真心喊你妈吗，他能属于你吗？竟然有战友买了几十套房子，这回一赔全收没了。给我说：七哥，我这几套房全收了。我说：我只能祝福你失去了房子，你没有失去命。不要让自己的无知和贪婪，在你一个人身上体现出灾难。

This is where the CCP is evil and why we must take it down. Brothers and sisters, stop being naive. Are you still holding many properties? So many people will die because of greed and ignorance. In China, it is okay to have one house to live in. Do you still expect to make a fortune by investing in real estate and pass on the property to the next generation? Have you ever seen houses and real estate in any other country built on the land that does not belong to the house-owner? Can a child born through surrogacy be the same as the one raised by yourself? Some fellow fighters invested in dozens of properties, but this time they lost them all. A fellow fighter told me: “Brother Miles, I lost all my houses.” I said: “I can only congratulate you for losing your houses because you didn’t lose your life.” Brothers and sisters, please don’t let your ignorance and greed lead you into a disaster.

兄弟姐妹们，共产党不亡，谁都不会有钱，谁都不会有未来，谁也不会有幸福。如果你在这事还天真，或者说首鼠两端，你还想试试，请！哦，这是川普的家啊，看川普的家，就是最上层，咖啡色那个，他家一整层，一整层。哈哈。现在曼哈顿就我们俩这整层的房子亮着了。哈哈哈。我昨天我看这老人家真有点儿老了，真有点儿老了，真有点儿老了。但是斗志没减啊，对共产党的认识越来越深刻，这个不孬不孬。但是你看看这曼哈顿空城，空城啊。你看他家下面没人了，也没人抗议他了，原来还天天有人抗议，现在也没人抗议了。俺得开会去喽。

Brother and sisters, if we don’t take down the CCP, no one will have money, future, or a happy life. If you are still naive or hesitant on this issue, and you continue to be greedy, then please, go your own way. Oh, that is Trump’s home. Look, it is the brown one atop the tower. His family occupies the whole floor. There might be only two floors here, his and mine, that still have lighting. Yesterday, I saw him looked a little older, but his spirit was as good as before. His understanding of the CCP is more profound, which is incredibly great. Everybody, please look at the Manhattan block. It looks like an empty city. No one protests against Trump downstairs anymore. When he was president, there were protests every day. Yet, there is no one anymore now. I have got to go to the meeting.
