英文標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep218: Global Joint Demonstration in Germany. Despite the rain, the New Federal State of China’s members in Germany also protested the CCP

內容簡介

1. 《糧食進口不等於糧食缺口》另有中共官媒刊文大陸糧食連年豐收，謊稱糧食進口不等於糧食缺口。如果国内不缺粮食为何需要从国外进口呢？
2. 《糧油米麵被搶空》但百姓已有警覺，開始搶購儲備糧油。中共糧食危機即將曝光。
3. 《全球聯合大遊行—加拿大，日本》繼喜馬拉雅加拿大農場在多倫多中共領事館前遊行抗議CCP的專制邪惡之後，同日，新中國聯邦的喜馬拉雅日本大阪農場亦展開遊行，計劃繞行大阪3天，反抗邪惡中共，宣傳CCP病毒真相。
4. 《全球聯合大遊行—歐洲德國》新中國聯邦歐洲戰友也在德國冒雨遊行反抗中共。
5. （8/27）（共產黨）它現在發現，新中國聯邦真的威脅到它的生死存亡了。更重要的，它發現美國和西方真的聽咱的話了，真相信咱說的話了。第三個它發現，咱真可能能把這個，讓全世界以美滅共、以法滅共、以共滅共這三招，他發現都靈了。


1. The CCP’s official media published an article《Food imports doesn’t equal to food shortage》, indicating grain crops in mainland China have been harvesting for years, falsely claiming that food imports does not equal to food shortage. Why importing grain crops if there was no food shortage in China?
2. 《Shelves of grain, oil, rice, and noodles are stripped bare》as reported, commoners have been on alert and started with panic buying and storing up grain and oil. CCP’s food crisis is about to be exposed.
3. Global Joint Demonstration in Canada and Japan. After the Himalaya Canada Branch protested the evil, totalitarian CCP in front of the Chinese Consulate in Toronto, on the same day, the New Federal State of China’s Himalaya Japan Branch started a 3-day demonstration in Osaka, protesting the evil CCP and propagating the truth about the CCP virus.
4. Global Joint Demonstration in Germany. Despite the rain, the New Federal State of China’s members in Germany also protested the CCP.
5. (8/27) The CCP have now realized that the New Federal State of China has truly become a threat to them, which has a say on their life and death. More importantly, the CCP found out that America and the West really listen to and believe what we say. Thirdly, the CCP has discovered that we are able to take them down with America’s help, with law, with CCP members. They realized that the above three tactics have worked.
