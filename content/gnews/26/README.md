In recent days, the media has taken to sounding the alarm bells over a “second wave” of coronavirus infections. Such panic is overblown. Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and the courage and compassion of the American people, our public health system is far stronger than it was four months ago, and we are winning the fight against the invisible enemy.

近日，媒體紛紛敲響新冠病毒感染“第二波”將要到來的警鐘，這種誇大其詞的說法引起了公眾的恐慌。多虧了川普總統的領導和美國人民的勇氣與同情心，我們的公共衛生系統目前所取得的成就是四個月前所不能比的。我們正在贏得與隱密敵人的戰鬥。

While talk of an increase in cases dominates cable news coverage, more than half of states are actually seeing cases decline or remain stable. Every state, territory and major metropolitan area, with the exception of three, have positive test rates under 10%. And in the six states that have reached more than 1,000 new cases a day, increased testing has allowed public health officials to identify most of the outbreaks in particular settings—prisons, nursing homes and meatpacking facilities—and contain them.

雖然有關病例增加的報導佔據了有線電視新聞頻道的主要篇幅，但實際上，超過一半的州的病例數量在下降或保持穩定。除三個州外，每個州、地區和主要大都會城市的陽性測試率均低於10%。在每天新增病例超過1000例的6個州中，不斷增加的檢測使得公共衛生官員認識到大部分病例爆發發生在特定場所 （監獄、療養院和肉類加工廠），並得以控制。

Lost in the coverage is the fact that today less than 6% of Americans tested each week are found to have the virus. Cases have stabilized over the past two weeks, with the daily average case rate across the U.S. dropping to 20,000—down from 30,000 in April and 25,000 in May. And in the past five days, deaths are down to fewer than 750 a day, a dramatic decline from 2,500 a day a few weeks ago—and a far cry from the 5,000 a day that some were predicting.

報導中忽略了的一個事實，那就是現在每週接受檢測的美國人中只有不到6％的人被發現攜帶這種病毒。增長病例在過去的兩周里穩定了下來。全美日平均病例率從4月的3萬例和5月的2.5萬例下降到2萬例。並且在過去的五天內，死亡人數從幾週前的每天2,500人大幅下降到每天750人，與一些人預測的每天5,000人相差甚遠。

The truth is that we’ve made great progress over the past four months, and it’s a testament to the leadership of President Trump. When the president asked me to chair the White House Coronavirus Task Force at the end of February, he directed us to pursue not only a whole-of-government approach but a whole-of-America approach. The president brought together major commercial labs to expand our testing capacity, manufacturers to produce much-needed medical equipment, and major pharmaceutical companies to begin research on new medicines and vaccines. He rallied the American people to embrace social-distancing guidelines. And the progress we’ve made is remarkable.

但事實是，在過去的四個月裡，我們取得了巨大的進步，這證明了川普總統的領導力。當總統在2月底邀請我擔任白宮冠狀病毒特別工作組主席時，他要求我們不僅要整個政府參，而且要整個美國參與。總統匯集了主要的商業實驗室以擴大我們的檢測能力，召集了製造廠商以生產急需的醫療設備，以及主要的製藥公司研究新藥和疫苗。他號召美國人民接受社交距離準則，至此我們取得了驚人的進步。

We’ve expanded testing across the board. At the end of February, between Centers for Disease Control and Prevention labs and state public health facilities, the U.S. had performed only about 8,000 coronavirus tests. As of this week, we are performing roughly 500,000 tests a day, and more than 23 million tests have been performed in total.

我們已經將測試擴張到所有領域。截至2月底，美國疾控中心、預防中心實驗室，以及州公共衛生機構僅進行了僅約8,000次冠狀病毒測試。然而截至本週，我們每天進行了50萬次檢測，總共進行了2千3百多萬次檢測。

We’ve also vastly expanded our supplies of crucial medical equipment. In March, there were genuine fears that hospitals in our hot spots would run out of personal protective equipment like N95 masks, gloves or, even worse, ventilators for patients battling respiratory failure. The Strategic National Stockpile hadn’t been refilled since the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009, and it had only 10,000 ventilators on hand.

同時，我們還極大地增加了重要醫療設備的供應。 3月份時，人們曾經很擔心在疫情嚴重地區的醫院可能會耗盡如N95、手套等物資。更糟糕的是，呼吸衰竭患者所需的呼吸機等防護設備也會告罄。自2009年爆發甲型H1N1流感以來，國家戰略儲備一直沒有補充，致使我們只有1萬台呼吸機可以調用。

Since then, we’ve increased the supply of personal protective equipment by the billions. Our administration launched Project Air Bridge—a partnership between the federal government and private companies—that, as of June 12, had conducted more than 200 flights from overseas to deliver more than 143 million N95 masks, 598 million surgical and procedural masks, 20 million eye and face shields, 265 million gowns and coveralls, and 14 billion gloves. In addition, we’ve worked with the private sector to ramp up ventilator production. Today, we have more than 30,000 ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile, and we’re well on our way to building 100,000 ventilators in 100 days. No American who required a ventilator was ever denied one.

從那時起，我們增加了數十億個人防護物資的供應。截止6月12日，美國政府啟動了聯邦政府與私營公司之間的合作項目“航空橋計劃”，該計劃包括了200多次的國際航班，運送交付超過1.43億個N95口罩，5.98億個手術口罩，2000萬個眼睛和麵部防護罩，2.65億件防護服，和140億雙手套。此外，我們還與私營部門合作，以提高呼吸機的產量。今天，我們的國家戰略儲備中已有3萬多台呼吸機，我們正朝著100天內建造10萬台呼吸機的方向邁進。任何需要呼吸機的美國人都能夠得到它。

We’ve also made great progress on developing therapeutics and a vaccine. Last month, the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences announced it would donate about 940,000 vials of its new drug remdesivir to treat more than 120,000 patients in the U.S.  Under Operation Warp Speed, the federal government is already funding research into multiple vaccine candidates, and we are well on our way to having a viable vaccine by the fall.

我們在提高治療方案和疫苗開發方面也取得了巨大進步。上個月，製藥公司吉利德科學（Gilead Sciences）宣布將捐贈約94萬瓶新藥瑞德西韋（Remdesivir）用於治療超過12多萬的病人。在“急速行動”計劃指導下，聯邦政府已經資助了多種候選疫苗的研究，我們正努力在秋天前研製出可行的疫苗。

But our greatest strength is the resilience of the American people. From the outset of this pandemic, the American people have stepped up and made great personal sacrifices to protect the health and safety of our nation. And it’s because of their embrace of social-distancing guidelines that all 50 states have begun to reopen in a safe and responsible manner.

但我們最強大的力量是美國人民的韌性。從疫情大流行的開始，美國人民就挺身而出做出了巨大的個人犧牲，以保護我們國家的健康與安全。正是因為他們遵循了社交距離準則，所有50個州都已以安全和負責的方式重新開放了。

The media has tried to scare the American people every step of the way, and these grim predictions of a second wave are no different. The truth is, whatever the media says, our whole-of-America approach has been a success. We’ve slowed the spread, we’ve cared for the most vulnerable, we’ve saved lives, and we’ve created a solid foundation for whatever challenges we may face in the future. That’s a cause for celebration, not the media’s fear mongering.

媒體一直在嚇唬美國人民，這次他們對第二波浪潮的可怕預言也非例外。但事實是，無論媒體怎麼說，我們所採取的全美參與的做法是成功的。我們減緩了疫情蔓延的速度，我們照顧了易受感染的人群，我們拯救了生命，我們為未來可能面臨的任何挑戰奠定了堅實的基礎。這就是我們值得慶賀的原因，而不是聽取媒體所散佈的恐懼言論。
