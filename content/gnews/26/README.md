**摘要：在2021年5月7日的盖特视频中，郭先生解释了为什么中共那么害怕虚拟货币，因为区块链虚拟货币的最大属性是安全隐秘性，共产党无法任意抢劫你的财富。他说中共国巨额资金外逃，很多都流入了加密货币，对共产党的金融系统是毁灭性的打击，因为都知道共产党要完蛋了。**

**为什么共产党害怕加密虚拟货币？**

**Why Is the CCP Afraid of Cryptocurrencies?**

要看到现在中共国内部[的问题]，像今天中信银行阻止国内任何人买比特币，[谁]买比特币[就]把帐号给你关了。招商银行事实上两周前已经开始了，民生银行也是早就开始了，而且为此抓了很多人。

Let’s see what’s happening within the CCP right now. For instance, today the China CITIC Bank stopped people in mainland China from buying bitcoins, and whoever buys bitcoins, his account will be closed. China Merchants Bank actually started  to do this two weeks ago, and Minsheng Bank started even earlier, and many people have been arrested because of this.

大家要问一个问题：为什么那么多人要买比特币，买虚拟货币？很简单的道理：因为大家觉得国内不安全。买这些币的原因都不是作为投资的，都是把钱避险的。

People may ask this question: Why are there so many people who want to buy bitcoins and virtual currencies? The reason is very simple. It’s because everyone feels that mainland China is not safe. The reason for buying these coins is not for investment, rather it is to avoid risks.

英国头两天有一个曾经最反对虚拟货币的人加入了我们喜币系列。我还纳闷呢，为什么他加入我们的喜币呢？我说你不是最反对吗？我说你不是说加密货币没有任何内含价值吗？他说了句话，他说：“我过去说的没有内含价值，[但]我没有说它没有外在价值。”

A couple of days ago, someone in the UK, who used to oppose virtual currencies most strongly, joined our H-Coin series. I was wondering why he joined our H-Coin, so I asked, “Didn’t you say that you would be the one who opposed to it the most strongly? Didn’t you say cryptocurrencies had no any intrinsic value?” He said, “What I said in the past is that it has no intrinsic value, but I didn’t say that it has no extrinsic value.”

所有的财富，当它没有锚定挂钩的时候，所有的财富就是信用。还有就是安全的需要。所有的加密货币，最关键的[一个功能]，是[让]财富安全，还有就是让它独立的存在，不受到任何其它的威胁。

All wealth, when it is not pegged to something, it basically relies on credit. Also there is the need for security. The most critical function of all cryptocurrencies is to make wealth safe and allow it to exist independently, not to be threatened by anything else.

一样的道理，中共为什么限制[比特币]？不是说别的，就是因为大量的财富转移。而且国开行很多人[被]抓也因为和比特币有关系。国开行贪污的钱放哪去，他们很清楚，最终是能找着的。只有放到了虚拟货币里面，放[到]了以太币，火币，狗币，放[到]比特币，虚拟货币[里面]，大量的钱，而且拿不回来。

Similarly, why does CCP restrict bitcoin? Nothing but to restrict the massive transfer of wealth. Besides, many people at the China Development Bank (CDB) being arrested was also related to bitcoin. They know very well where the money embezzled by the CDB was hidden and they will eventually find the money. But only when the money is put in virtual currencies such as Ether, Huobi, and Dogecoin, and bitcoin, they will never be able to find it.

过去抓了像王建海航，是吧？这些人的钱在海外，共产党来了，[有]本人授权[加上]公司授权，甚至带了公司的财务和家人到美国来，这房子开始卖，是吧！找得着[就]能卖。比特币，加密币它[共产党]找不着，想拿回来几乎不可能。所以说查这个案子可以，把人办了可以，钱找不着。不可能像共产党一样，一抢一端一窝一窝的。

For example, after people like Wang Jian of HNA were caught, the CCP would come for their assets overseas. The CCP can obtain their own or their company’s authorization first, and even bring their company’s accountants and their family members to the US so that their properties can be sold, right? However, money in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cannot be found by the CCP, and it is almost impossible to take it away by the CCP. So it can investigate a case and arrest people, but the money will never be found. It will never be like the case when the CCP points a gun at someone, it will find the money this person previously hided in caves.

那么另外大家看到现在日本最近加密货币、虚拟货币起起伏伏当中，可以看到日本的经济也是在危在旦夕。因为大量的财富也进了加密货币、虚拟货币。

In addition, everyone can see that Japan’s recent ups and downs in cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies show that Japan’s economy is already at the verge of collapse. Because massive wealth has entered encrypted currencies and virtual currencies.

只有区块链上安全，任何其它货币，任何可以等价或者有价衡量的证券都是被政治、被权力可以控制甚至可以销毁，甚至可以不算数的，那就没有任何信用可存在。它又没有安全性，那你要它什么？它本身就是一个贸易的工具，一个生产力的交易工具。所有加密货币第一条就是安全，所以很多人没闹明白：加密货币、区块链把人类整个财富和生产力的交换和生活方式彻底改变了 — 这是为什么共产党害怕？

Blockchain is the only safe place. Any other currencies or securities whose value can be measured are all controlled by politics and powers, and can even be destroyed or voided. So there is no credibility in them at all. Since they are not safe, why do you want to have them? They are a trading tool, a tool for trading products. But the number one feature of cryptocurrencies is their security. Many people don’t understand this. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain have completely changed the way how we exchange wealth and productivity and changed the lifestyle of mankind entirely. This is why the CCP is so afraid.

几个月以前我说过1000多亿转到了加拿大，这些钱里边很多都投入了加密货币。不但如此，战友们还要看到一个更夸张的[情况就是]香港以及在亚洲有多少拿来生产，甚至贷款的钱都加入了加密货币 — 这对共产党的金融系统是摧毁的。为什么要这么做？因为都认为共产党要完球蛋了。

A few months ago I said that more than 100 billion yuan was transferred to Canada, and much of it has been invested in cryptocurrencies. Not only that, my brothers and sisters, you will see that in Hong Kong and Asia a lot of money which was supposed to be used for production and even loans has been invested in cryptocurrencies. This is literally destroying the CCP’s financial system. Why do they do that? Because they all believe that the CCP will be over.

而且共产党里边黑钱是全人类最大的，数以几万亿美元，共产党在倒闭前如果有个两三万亿美元流入到加密货币市场它所造成的效应是数十万亿美元，边际效应是几十万亿美元。

Moreover, the CCP has the most dirty money in all mankind – several trillion U.S. dollars. If two or three trillion dollars flow into the cryptocurrency market before the CCP collapses, it will have an impact of tens of trillions of dollars, so the marginal effect will be tens of trillions of dollars.
