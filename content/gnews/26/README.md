3. The sirens scream in Urumqi every day while people live in fear. “That’s the siren, every single day, I have no idea when I could get out again. ” Local residents believe that the CCP authorities are using the epidemic as an excuse to arrest people on a larger scale and more thoroughly by blocking, quarantining, and detaining them. CCP’s object is to strengthen its control over people in Xinjiang.

The visit of Czech delegation led by the president of the Senate Miloš Vystrčil to Taiwan made CCP’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi hit the roof, who reacted with a “wolf warrior” kind of threat in his rhetoric.

5. (9/1)  Look at those Mongolian kids. This is such a big deal.  Many of our Mongolian brothers and sisters asked me what they should do. I said “Don’t worry. The price you are paying will not be in vain.” Remember, children of Mongolia, we are exposing the facts on the current situation in Inner Mongolia to the West.
