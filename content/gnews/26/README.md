## 川普總統6.11參加《向偉大過渡：恢復、重建、復甦》座談會（中英文對照全文）
`2020-06-14 02:11 Isaiah4031` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hant/233359/)

川普總統於2020年6月11日與非裔美國人社區和信仰領袖在德克薩斯州的達拉斯舉行了一次圓桌會議，討論如何恢復、重建和復蘇非裔美國人社區和警隊改革的切實方法。多位非裔和宗教代表發表了充滿激情的演講和對川普總統政府的褒獎，發出了完全不同於主流媒體的，真正來自美國少數族裔和信仰社區的聲音。會議中間想起了無數次熱烈的掌聲。



THE PRESIDENT:  Nice place.  Wow.  I’ve been hearing about this one.  Great job.  (Laughter.)  Great job.  Thank you very much for being here.  It’s an honor.  And very important time in our country.  A lot of things are happening.  And I think when it all ends up, it’s going to end up very good for everybody.

**總統：**哇，好地方， 我聽說過這裏。 幹的漂亮 （笑聲），幹得漂亮。非常感謝妳們的到來。 很榮幸，也是我們國家非常重要的時刻。 很多事情正在發生。 我認為，當這一切結束的時候，最終將對每個人都有好處。

It’s an honor to be at Gateway Church with the Attorney General — our great Attorney General, William Barr.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  And my friend, Ben Carson, who’s done a fantastic job at HUD.  Secretary.  (Applause.)  And a young star, Jerome Adams, General.  Where is Jerome?  Jerome?  (Applause.)  Along with a lot of my friends out in the audience.  In fact, a lot of the great political leaders from Texas, I see.  Some great, great friends.

很榮幸能和司法部長，我們偉大的司法部長威廉·巴爾，在凱門（Gateway）教堂見面，謝謝。 （掌聲）。我的朋友本·卡森在HUD幹得非常出色。 部長。 （掌聲）。 還有一個年輕的明星，傑羅姆·亞當斯，將軍。 傑羅姆在哪？ 傑羅姆？ （掌聲）。 還有觀眾中我的很多朋友。 事實上，我看到很多來自德克薩斯州的偉大政治領袖。 他們是我非常非常好的朋友

And I want to thank you all for being here: faith leaders; members of law enforcement, so important.  We want law and order.  We have to have a lot of good things, but we have to have law and order.  (Applause.)

我想感謝你們所有人：宗教領袖、執法人員，非常重要。我們需要法律和秩序，我們必須有很多好東西，但法律和秩序必不可少。（掌聲）

Got to have some strength.  You have to have strength.  You have to do what you have to do.  And you look at a Seattle — we just came in; we just see over the screen, and we’ve been hearing about it.  Bill and I were talking about it: the law and order.  Look at what happened in Seattle: They took over a city.  A city.  A big city — Seattle.  Took a chunk of it — a big chunk.  Can’t happen.  That couldn’t happen here, I don’t think, in the state of Texas, could it?  (Laughter.)  I don’t think so.  (Applause.)  I don’t think so.

我們要有力量，必須有力量。 做當做的事。你看看西雅圖：我們剛才進來; 我們剛剛在屏幕上看到，我們一直都有聽說這件事。 比爾和我在談法律與秩序。 看看西雅圖發生了什麽：他們接管了一座城市。 一座城市。 一座大城市：西雅圖。 佔領了一大塊地方。 這種事情是不能發生的。我想，在德克薩斯州是不可能發生發生那種事情的，可以嗎?(笑聲) 我想不會。(掌聲)。我想不會。

So I want to thank Pastors Robert Morris and Steve Dulin.  They’re great people.  (Applause.)  Great people with a great reputation.  I have to say that.  Great reputation.  And Gateway Church — the team has been incredible in hosting us.

所以我要感謝羅伯特·莫里斯牧師和史蒂夫·杜林牧師。他們是偉大的人（掌聲），享有盛譽的偉人。我不得不這麼說，享有盛譽。還有凱門教會的團隊在接待我們的過程中表現得非常出色。

And I’d now like to ask Pastor Morris and Bishop Jackson to lead us in prayer.  Thank you.

我現在想請莫里斯牧師和傑克遜主教帶領我們禱告。謝謝你們。

PASTOR MORRIS:  Thank you.

**莫里斯牧師：**謝謝。

Lord, we need you.  We need you at this time in our country.  And I thank

you for our President.  I thank you, Lord, for our leaders.  I thank you, thank you, thank you.

I know in the Bible that, when something was emphasized, it was repeated: “holy, holy, holy.”  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Lord, that we are about to bring tremendous progress to a problem that’s been here for a long time.  And I thank you for this administration.  And, Lord, we pray your blessings and your guidance today on this meeting, in Jesus name.

主啊，我們需要你。此時此刻我們國家需要你。為我們的總統感謝祢。主啊，我為我們的領袖感謝祢。謝謝祢，謝謝，謝謝。我知道在《聖經》裏，當強調某件事時，就重復說：”聖潔，聖潔，聖潔”。 謝謝祢，謝謝祢，主啊，我們即將在一個長期存在的問題上取得巨大的進步。 我為本屆政府感謝祢。 主啊，我們祈求祢的祝福和指引，奉耶穌的名。

BISHOP JACKSON:  Father, we thank you so much for what you’re doing today.  You have revealed so many things that are untoward, even evil.  But we ask, according to Isaiah 50, verse 4, that you would give us the tongue of the learned that we should know how to speak to the heart of this nation.

**傑克森主教：**天父，我們非常感謝祢今天所做的事。 祢使乖僻，甚至邪惡的事顯露出來。 但是，我們根據以賽亞書50章第4節請求祢賜給了我們受教者的舌頭， 讓我們知道如何對國民的心對話。

Give us a word in season to Him that’s weary, and waken us morning by morning, God, that we would hear and speak.  We have a great, courageous President who’s a problem solver.  And let him speak as your mouthpiece and act as your instrument.  And we thank you for this time.  Amen.

神啊，求祢讓我們知道怎樣用言語扶助疲乏的人，每天清晨喚醒我們，使我們能像受教者一樣靜聽。我們有一位偉大、勇敢、善於解決問題的總統。 讓他為祢說話、為祢行事。我們感謝祢賜給我們的這段時間。阿們。

AUDIENCE:  Amen.  (Applause.)

**觀眾：**阿門。 （掌聲）

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Bishop.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I want to thank you, Bishop, and thank you very much, Pastor.  That’s great.  And we’re going to be discussing some pretty important things today, I think.  It’s all important, but the timing of this is very appropriate.  This was set up, actually, a long time ago, but the timing is very appropriate.

**總統：**非常感謝，主教。 謝謝！非常感謝。我想感謝你，主教，非常感謝，牧師。 真棒。 我想，我們今天將討論一些非常重要的事情。 這一切都很重要，時機非常合適。 事實上，這是很久以前就安排好的，但現在時機非常合適。

We are here to listen to community and faith leaders — going to be hearing from a lot of the good ones; some of the great ones, but a lot of the good ones — and to present our vision of advancing the cause of justice and freedom.

我們來這裏是為了傾聽社區和宗教領袖的聲音，將會聽到很多很好的領袖的聲音; 有些偉大的，但也有很多是很好的人，展示了我們推進正義和自由事業的願景。

From day one, I’ve been fighting for the forgotten men and women of America, and I think we’ve been doing a great job of it.  We’ve been doing a lot in many other ways, but it gets lost a little bit sometimes.  Bishop, you know that.  It gets lost.  We’ve done so much.  And a lot of the things that we’ve done that we’re very proud of gets lost.  Like, we got criminal justice reform passed, and they’ve been trying to do it for many years — (applause) — and they haven’t been able to do get it passed.

從第一天起，我就一直在為美國被遺忘的人們而戰，我認為我們一直在為此做著偉大的工作。 我們在很多其他方面都做了很多，但有時會被遺忘掉。 主教，你知道的，會被遺忘。 我們已經做了很多了。 我們做過的很多引以為榮的事情都被遺忘了。 比如，我們通過了刑事司法改革，他們多年來一直在努力，（掌聲），但他們一直沒能讓它通過。

We secured permanent and record-setting funding for HBCUs.  That’s historically black colleges and universities.  (Applause.)  It’s all done.

我們確保了傳統黑人高校得到永久性和創紀錄的資金。都是傳統的黑人學院和大學。(掌聲)。都完成了。

We created tens of thousands of jobs with Opportunity Zones.  Tim Scott.  And we had a great senator from South Carolina that many of you know.  He came with an idea, and I thought it was a great idea, and we got it done.  A lot of people said that could never happen, but nobody thought it would be successful like it is.  Tens of thousands of jobs and investment in communities where that money wouldn’t go.

我們通過機會區創造了數以萬計的就業機會。 蒂姆·斯科特。我們有一位來自南卡羅來納州的偉大參議員，你們很多人都認識他。 他帶來了一個想法，我認為這是個好主意，我們就做成了。 很多人說這永遠不可能發生，沒有人想到它會像現在這樣成功。 數以萬計的就業機會和投資在社區，不然錢就不會流向那些地方。

And we achieved the lowest black unemployment in the history of our country, prior to the plague coming in from China.  (Applause.)  And we’ll get it back again soon.  It’ll happen soon.  That’ll happen very soon.

在瘟疫從中國傳入之前，我們實現了我國歷史上最低的黑人失業率。 （掌聲）。 我們很快就會把它找回來。 很快就會發生的。 很快就會發生的。

In recent days, there have been vigorous discussion about how to ensure fairness, equality, and justice for all of our people.  Unfortunately, there are some trying to stoke division and to push an extreme agenda, which we won’t go for, that will produce only more poverty, more crime, more suffering.  This includes radical efforts to defund, dismantle, and disband the police. They want to get rid of the police forces.  They actually want to get rid of it.  And that’s what they do, and that’s where they go.  And you know that, because at the top position, there’s not going to be much leadership; there’s not much leadership left.

最近幾天，就如何確保我們全體人民的公平、平等和正義進行了熱烈的討論。 不幸的是，有些人試圖煽動分裂，推動一個極端的議程，我們是不會去做的，那只會造成更多的貧困、更多的犯罪、更多的苦難。 這包括撤資、解散和瓦解警察的激進行動。他們想取消警察。 他們實際上是想取消警察部隊。他們想那麼做，往那邊走。 你知道，因為在最高職位上，沒有什麼領導權了; 領導權就所剩無幾了。

Instead, we have to go the opposite way.  We must invest more energy and resources in police training and recruiting and community engagement.  We have to respect our police.  We have to take care of our police.  They’re protecting us.  And if they’re allowed to do their job, they’ll do a great job.  And you always have a bad apple, no matter where you go.  You have bad apples.  And there are not too many of them.  And I can tell you there are not too many of them in the police department.  We all know a lot of members of the police.

相反，我們必須採取相反的措施。 我們必須在警察的培訓和招募以及社區參與方面投入更多的精力和資源。 我們必須尊重我們的警察。 我們必須照顧我們的警察。 他們在保護我們。如果他們被允許做他們的工作，他們會做得非常好。 無論你去哪裏，都有害群之马。 有害群之马。 然而這樣的人並不多。 我可以告訴妳，在警察部門這樣的人並不多。我們都認識很多警察。

I was listening today; a friend of mine was on.  A very important person said some of the best people he’s ever met are policemen, law enforcement people.  And they’re taking care of people that, in many cases, they never even met before, and at great danger, at great risk.  They get shot for no reason whatsoever, other than they’re wearing blue.  They get knifed.  You saw that the other night.  It was a horrible thing.

我今天在聽; 我的一個朋友來了， 一個很重要的人說過他見過的最好的人是警察，執法人員。 他們照顧的人，在許多情況下，他們甚至從來沒有見過，他們冒著極大的危險，冒著極大的風險。 他們會無緣無故遭受槍擊，只因為穿著藍色衣服。 他們會被刀刺傷，那天晚上你們都看見了，真是一件可怕的事情。

But there is no opportunity without safety.  In Chicago, 48 people were shot, and 18 people were killed in one day.  Sunday, May 31st.  Think of that.  Forty-eight people shot; eighteen people killed.  You don’t hear about it too much.

但是沒有安全就沒有機會。 在芝加哥，有48人被槍殺，18人在一天內喪生。 5月31日，星期日。 想想看， 48人被槍殺; 18人被殺，很多人都沒聽到這事。

Every child should be able to grow up in a safe community, free from violence and fear.  They’ve taken a lot of the police protection away in Chicago, and they have great, great police in Chicago.  I know Chicago very well, but they’re not allowed to do what they can do better than anybody.  They could do the job very easily.

每个儿童都应该能够在没有暴力和恐惧的安全社区里成长。 芝加哥已经取消了很多警察保护，芝加哥有非常非常好的警察。 我非常了解芝加哥，他們可以比任何人做得更好，但他们不被允许做。 他们本可以很容易地完成这项工作。

Americans are good and virtuous people.  We have to work together to confront bigotry and prejudice wherever they appear.  But we’ll make no progress and heal no wounds by falsely labeling tens of millions of decent Americans as racists or bigots.  We have to get everybody together.  We have to be on the same — the same path, I think, Pastor.  If we don’t do that, we have — we have problems.  And we’ll do that.  We’ll do it.  I think we’re going to do it very easily.  It’ll go quickly and it’ll go — it’ll go very easily.

美國人是善良和有道德的人。 我們必須共同努力，對抗任何地方出現的偏見和歧視。 但是，如果我們錯誤地給數千萬體面的美國人貼上種族主義者或偏執狂的標簽，我們將不會取得任何進展，也不會治愈任何創傷。 我們必須讓所有人團結起來。我們必須走在同一條道路上，我想，牧師。 如果我們不這樣做，我們就會有問題。我們會這樣做。我們將這樣做。我想我們會很容易做到的。 很快就會做到，很容易就會做到。

We have so many different elements of strength in this country.  We have such potential in this country.  We have the greatest potential.  We have the greatest country in the world.  But we get off subject.  We start thinking about things that don’t matter or don’t matter much.  And the important things, we don’t even discuss.  But we’re here to discuss some very important things.

我們這個國家有許多不同的力量。 我們在這個國家有這種潛力。 我們有最大的潛力。 我們有世界上最偉大的國家。 但是我們跑題了。 我們開始思考那些毫無關系或無關緊要的事情。對於重要的事情，我們甚至都不討論。 但是我們在這裏討論一些非常重要的事情。

Today, politicians make false charges, and they’re trying to distract from their own failed records.  They have some very bad records.  And these are usually the ones that cause the problems or can’t solve the problems.  These are the same politicians who shipped our jobs away and took tremendous advantage of all Americans.  But African American middle class — so much of that wealth and that money and those jobs went to China and other countries.  And they get trapped.  They get trapped.  They get trapped in a government morass.  They get trapped in bad government schools.

今天，政客們做出虛假指控，他們試圖轉移人們對他們失敗記錄的註意力。 他們有一些非常糟糕的記錄。 他們通常是導致問題或不能解決問題的人。 正是這些政客將我們的工作崗位移走，並過分地利用了所有美國人。 但是非裔美國人中產階級被困住了， 那麼多的財富、金錢和工作都流向了中國和其他國家。 他們被困住了，他們被困在政府的泥潭裏。 他們被困在糟糕的公立學校裏。

So I’m going to be announcing four steps to build safety and opportunity and dignity:

因此，我將宣布建立安全、機會和尊嚴的四個步驟:：

First, we’re aggressively pursuing economic development in minority communities.  We’re doing it very powerfully.  We’ve done it with Opportunity Zones, but we’re going to go above that.  At the heart of this effort is increasing access to capital for small businesses, and that’s with minority owners in black communities.  And we’re going to get it done, and it should have been done a long time ago.  It’s been very difficult — very, very difficult for some people.  It’s been unfairly difficult.

首先，我們正在積極推動少數民族社區的經濟發展。我們做得非常有力。我們成立了機會區，我們還會繼續。這項努力的核心是增加小企業獲得資金的渠道，也就是黑人社區的少數族裔業主。我們會完成它，它本來應該在很久以前就完成了的。這對一些人來說非常困難，非常非常困難。不公平地困難。

Second, we are confronting the healthcare disparities, including addressing chronic conditions and investing substantial sums in minority-serving medical institutions.  We have medical institutions in some areas of our country that are a disgrace.  I was going to say “not up to standard.”  They’re much worse than “not up to standard.”  They’re a disgrace.  We’ll take care of it.

第二，我們正在應對醫療保健方面的不平等，包括解決慢性病和向為少數族裔服務的醫療機構投入大量資金。我們國家的一些地區的醫療機構很丟臉。我想說“沒有達到標準”。比“不符合標準”糟糕得多。太丟人了。我們會處理的。

Third, we’re working to finalize an executive order that will encourage police departments nationwide to meet the most current professional standards for the use of force, including tactics for de-escalation.

第三，我們正在努力完成一項行政命令，該命令將鼓勵全國的警察部門在使用武力方面達到最新的專業標準，包括緩和緊張局勢的策略。

Also, we’ll encourage pilot programs that allow social workers to join certain law enforcement officers so that they work together.

此外，我們將鼓勵允許社會工作者與某些執法人員合作的試點項目，以便他們共同工作。

We’ll take care of our police.  We’ll take — we’re not defunding police.  If anything, we’re going the other route: We’re going to make sure that our police are well trained — perfectly trained, they have the best equipment.  (Applause.)

我們會照顧好我們的警察。我們不會取消對警察的資助。如果要做什麼的話，我們將走另一條路線:我們將確保我們的警察訓練有素，訓練完美，讓他們擁有最好的裝備。(掌聲)。

Some of the things that we have heard — because I know a lot of the people in the audience, and they’re professionals at what they do, and they’re successful people, and we’re hearing things that are not even thinkable.  I didn’t even hear — I’ve never even heard of this before last week.  It was like — it started about a week ago, where I heard they want to close up all police forces.  That’s what their attack on a very liberal governor in the state of Washington is: “We want the police force closed.”

我們聽到的一些事情，因為我認識聽眾中很多人，他們是專業人士、成功人士，我們聽到了無法想象的事情。我聽都沒聽說過， 上個星期以前還沒聽說過。大約一周前，我聽說他們要關閉所有警察部隊。這就是他們對華盛頓州那位非常自由派的州長的攻擊:“我們希望關閉警察部門。”

It’s not like they want to, sort of, bring a little money into something else; they want it actually closed.  I’m thinking, “What happens late at night when you make that call to 911 and there’s nobody there?”  What do you have — what do you do?  (Applause.)  Whether you’re white, black, or anybody else, I mean, what do you do?  You’re dialing, and there’s somebody breaking into a house, and it happens to be a violent person.  There are violent people around, Pastor.  Even you will admit that, right?

他們並不是想只挪出點錢花在別的事情上;他們希望真的關閉警察部門。我在想，“當你在深夜撥打911卻發現沒有人在的時候，會發生什麽? 那裏沒有人？ 你有什麽？ 妳怎麼辦？ （掌聲）。 不管妳是白人、黑人還是其他人，我的意思是，你怎麼辦? 你打電話的時候，有人闖進一戶人家，又碰巧是個暴力的人。牧師，這兒周圍有暴力的人，你得承認，對吧?

PASTOR MORRIS:  Yes.

**莫里斯牧師：**是的。

THE PRESIDENT:  We want to think the best — (laughter) — but you have some very violent people.  And when they’re breaking into your house at 12 o’clock in the evening, and you’re sitting there, and you don’t have a police force, they’re actually think- — they’re actually talking about not having a police force.  Well, that’s not happening with us.  We’re going to have stronger police forces because that’s what you need.

總統:我們想要想到最好的，(笑聲) 但是有一些非常暴力的人。當他們在晚上12點闖入妳的家，你坐在那裏，沒有警察，他們確實在想，他們確實在談論取消警察。我們可沒這麽做。我們將擁有更強大的警察隊伍，因為這是你們所需要的。

In Minneapolis, they went through three nights of hell.  And then I was insistent on having the National Guard go in and do their work.  It was like a miracle.  It just — everything stopped.  And I’ll never forget the scene.  It’s not supposed to be a beautiful scene, but, to me, it was — after you watch policemen running out of a police precinct.

在明尼阿波利斯，他們經歷了三個地獄之夜。然後我堅持讓國民警衛隊去做他們的工作。這簡直像個奇跡。一切都停止了。我永遠不會忘記那一幕。這不應該是一個美麗的場景，但是，對我來說，它是 …… 在你看到警察從警局逃出來之後……

And it wasn’t their fault.  They wanted to do what they had to do, but they weren’t allowed to do anything.  It wasn’t really their fault.  But they were running down the street.  They weren’t allowed to do what they’re trained to do.  And they took over the precinct.  They burned it — essentially burned it down.  I’m pretty good at construction.  I want to tell you: That was almost what we call a complete renovation, if you’re lucky.  (Laughter.)

那並不是他們的錯。他們想做他們要做的事，但他們不被允許做任何事。這並不是他們的錯。但他們在街上奔逃。他們不被允許做他們被訓練做的事情。他們接管了這個分局。他們把它燒了，真的把它燒了。我很擅長建築。我想告訴妳:如果你夠幸運的話，這幾乎就是我們所說的完全翻新。(笑聲)。

And it was a very sad thing.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like that.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like that.

這是一件非常悲哀的事。我從沒見過這樣的事。我從沒見過這樣的事。

But we are very proud of the fact that I called — I said, “I’m sorry.  We have to have them go in.”  And they went in, and it was like a knife cutting butter — right through.  Boom.  I’ll never forget.  You saw the scene: on that road, wherever it may be, in the city — Minneapolis.  They were lined up.  Boom — they just walked straight.  And, yes, there was some tear gas and probably some other things, and the crowd dispersed, and they went through it.  By the end of that evening — and it was a short evening — everything was fine and you didn’t hear too much about that location having problems anymore; they went to other locations.

但我們非常自豪的是，我打電話說，“對不起。我們必須讓他們進去。“然後他們就進去了，就像一把刀切黃油一樣。砰砰砰。我永遠不會忘記。你看到了這樣的場景:在那條路上，無論它在哪裏，在明尼阿波利斯市。他們排好隊。砰砰砰，他們徑直向前走。是的，用了一些催淚瓦斯，可能還有其他一些東西，然後人群散了，他們就過去了。那個晚上結束的時候，那是一個短暫的夜晚， 一切都很好了，再也沒有聽到太多關於那個地方有問題的消息了;他們去了其他地方。

And the same thing would happen.  As an example, Seattle would be so easy to solve.  It would be so easy to solve.  We have a governor here of a great state; it’s called Texas.  He would solve it very easily — (applause) — as would — as would other of your — as would other of your political leaders, including your lieutenant governor.  They would solve it very easily.

同樣的事情也會發生。 例如，西雅圖就很容易解決。 將會非常容易解決。 我們有一個偉大的州叫作德克薩斯州，州長很容易就能解決這個問題，其他政治領導人，包括副州長，同樣很容易地就能解決這個問題，（掌聲）他們很容易就能解決它。

It’s — a lot of it is common sense.  I don’t even think it’s courage.  I think it’s probably more courageous the other way, because I wouldn’t want to be doing it the other way.  It’s very unsafe.

很多都是常識。我甚至不認為這是勇氣。我認為另一種方法可能更勇敢，因為我不想用另一種方法。這是非常不安全的。

So I just want to tell you that we’re working on a lot of different elements having to do with law, order, safety, comfort, control.  But we want safety.  We want compassion.  We want everything.

所以我想告訴妳們，我們正在研究很多關於法律、秩序、安全、舒適、控制有關的不同元素。但我們想要安全。我們想要同情。我們想要一切。

What happened two weeks ago was a disgrace when you see that.  What happened on numerous occasions over the last two weeks — people were killed.  A number of people were killed and it was very, very terrible and very, very unfair.  A number of them were police officers.  And it was a very unfair situation.  We don’t want to see that.

當你看到兩周前發生的事情時，會覺得很丟臉。過去兩周內發生的無數次事件：有人被殺。許多人被殺，這是非常非常可怕，非常非常不公平的。其中許多人是警察。這是一個非常不公平的情況。我們不想看到這些。

And with strength, you wouldn’t even have that.  They wouldn’t be in a position to do the kind of damage that they’ve done.  They’ve destroyed people.  They’ve destroyed businesses.  They’ve destroyed African-American-owned small businesses that, hopefully, they’re going to come back.  We’re providing funding for a lot of small businesses, and hopefully we’ll be able to get everybody online and get funding to be able to open up their stores and their small businesses again.

而如果有了力量，就不會出現那種情況。他們就不可能造成已經造成的那種傷害。他們摧毀了人。他們摧毀了生意。他們摧毀了非裔美國人擁有的小型企業，希望這些企業能卷土重來。我們正在為許多小企業提供資金，希望我們能夠讓每個人都上網，獲得資金來重新開設他們的商店和小企業。

But we’re working to finalize an executive order that will encourage police departments nationwide to meet the most current professional standards of force.  And that means force, but force with compassion.  But if you’re going to have to really do a job — if somebody is really bad, you’re going to have to do it with real strength, real power.

但我們正在努力完成一項行政命令，該命令將鼓勵全國的警察部門達到最新的專業力量標準。這意味著力量，但是帶著同情的力量。但是如果某人真的很壞，你就必須動用真正的力量、真正的權力來處理。

And I said — and people said, “Oh, I don’t know if we like that expression.”  I said, “We have to dominate the streets.”  You can’t let that happen, what happened in New York City — the damage they’ve done.  You have to dominate the streets.  (Applause.)

我說了，人們說，“哦，我不知道我們是否喜歡這個表達。“ 我說了：“我們必須控制街道。”“不能讓這種事情發生，不能讓發生在紐約的事情發生，不能讓他們造成的破壞發生。必須控制街道。(掌聲)。

And I was criticized for that statement.  I made the statements, “We have to dominate the street.”  And they said, “Oh that’s such a terrible thing.”  Well, guess what?  You know who dominated the streets?  People that you don’t want to dominate the streets, and look at the damage they did.

我因為那句話受到了批評。我發表了聲明：“我們必須控制街道。“ 他們說:“哦，這太可怕了。”“你猜怎麽著?”你知道誰統治了街道嗎?那些那不想控制街道的人，看看他們造成的破壞。

So I’ll stick with that, and I think most of the people in this room — maybe every person in this room — will stick with that.  And we’re doing it with compassion, if you think about it.  We’re dominating the street with compassion, because we’re saving lives and we’re saving businesses.  We’re saving families from being wiped out after working hard for 20 and 30 years.  I saw the one woman: She worked 35 years building a store, and in one night, in was totally wiped out.  It’s terrible.

所以我會堅持下去，我想這裡的大多數人，也許這裡的每個人，都會堅持下去。如果你想一下，我們是帶著同情去做的。我們滿懷同情地控制街道，因為我們在拯救生命，我們在拯救企業。許多家庭們努力工作了二、三十年，我們挽救了他們免於被摧毀。我看到一個女人:她工作了35年建造了一個商店，但是在一個晚上，裏面完全被夷為平地。這太可怕了。

And, fourth, we’re renewing our call on Congress to finally enact school choice now.  School choice is a big deal — (applause) — because access to education is the civil rights issue of our time.  And I’ve heard that for the last, I would say, year.  But it really is; it’s the civil rights issue of our time.  When you can have children go to a school where their parents want them to go.  And it creates competition.  And other schools fight harder because, all of a sudden, they say, “Wow.  We’re losing it.  We have to fight hard.”  It gets better in so many different ways.

第四，我們再次呼籲國會現在就通過《擇校法案》。學校選擇是一件大事，(掌聲)，因為受教育的機會是我們這個時代的民權問題。我想說，這是我去年聽到的。但它確實是; 這是我們這個時代的民權問題。當你能讓孩子去父母想讓他們去的學校時。這就產生了競爭。而其他學校會更努力，因為，突然，他們說，“哇。我們要輸了。我們必須努力奮鬥。“它在很多方面都會變得更好。

But there are groups of people against that.  You have unions against it.  You have others against it.  And they’re not against it for the right reasons.  They’re against it for a lot of the wrong reasons.  And we’re going to get that straightened out.  Now, we’ve done a lot of it.  We’ve had tremendous success with choice.

但也有一些人反對。有工會反對它。有人反對。他們也沒有理由反對。他們反對它有很多錯誤的理由。我們要把它擺平。我們已經做了很多了。我們在選擇方面取得了巨大成功。

We had choice in a lot of ways.  We also have choice in the military.  You know, before I came here, the vets would wait on line, Pastor.  They’d be waiting — you — it wouldn’t be acceptable to you.  I know it wouldn’t be acceptable to the Bishop.  I know it’s not going to be acceptable to you.  They’d wait for four or five weeks to get on line — a vet — where they were sick.  They were feeling badly, and they’d get on line, and they’d say, “There’s a six-day wait, sir.”  “There’s a two-week wait.”  “There’s a one-month wait.”  And you’d have people on line that weren’t very ill, and they’d be terminally ill before they got to see a doctor, and they’d die.

我們在很多方面都有選擇。我們在軍隊中也有選擇。妳知道，在我來這裏之前，老兵們要排隊在網上等，牧師。他們要等，你不會接受的。我知道主教不會接受的。我知道你不會接受的。他們要等上四、五個星期才行。他們感覺不舒服，他們就會上網，他們說，“要等六天，先生。”“要等兩周。”“要等一個月。”在網上等的有些不是病得很重的人，輪到他們去看醫生的時候就已經病入膏肓，他們會死的。

And for years and years, they’ve been trying to get Veterans Choice.  That means if you can’t get to a doctor reasonably quickly, you go outside, you go to a local doctor around where you live, and the government pays the bill.  And, by the way, it sounds expensive; it’s very cheap, by comparison.  It’s actually much better.  Now, most importantly, we take care of our vets.  By far, most importantly.  (Applause.)

多年來，他們一直在努力讓退伍軍人有選擇。這意味著如果你不能很快見到醫生，你可以到外面去，去你住的地方附近找一個當地的醫生，由政府支付賬單。順便說一下，這聽起來很貴;相比之下，它很便宜。實際上好多了。現在，最重要的是，我們要照顧好我們的老兵。最重要的是，到目前為止。(掌聲)。

But it’s one of those many cases where it’s actually less costly and better.  Sometimes you’ll see a building — it costs less money than another building that costs more, because the one that built the one that cost more, this one looks better.  The one that’s cheaper, it looks better.  They say, “How much more did you spend for that building?”  Actually, we spent less.  You can do that.  It’s called: “You have to know what you’re doing” — (laughter) — if you know what you’re doing.  That’s only good for the real estate people in here, of which there are plenty, by the way.

但这只是其中一种，它实际上更便宜、更好。有时你会看到一栋楼：它比另一栋楼花的钱少，因为那栋楼花的钱多，这栋楼看起来更好。便宜的那个看起来更好。他们会问，“那栋楼你多花了多少钱?”“实际上，我们花得更少了。你可以做到的。這叫做“你必须知道你在做什么 (笑声) ，如果你知道你在做什么。这只对这里的房地产人有好处，顺便说一下，这里的房地产人很多。

So I just want to thank everybody.  This is a tremendous place.  This is a great city.  This is a great, great city and with tremendous people and tremendous pride.  And I say the same for the state of Texas.  You know, your governor came to me, and he said — when you had your bad hurricane two years ago, I gave so much money to Texas.  More — he kept coming: “More.”  (Laughter.)  “How about here?  How about…”

所以我想感謝所有人。這是一個偉大的地方。這是一個偉大的城市。這是一個非常非常偉大的城市，擁有眾多的人口和巨大的自豪感。我也對德克薩斯州說同樣的話。你們知道，你們的州長來找我，兩年前你們遭遇颶風時，我給了德克薩斯州很多錢。他繼續說:“要更多。“ (笑聲)“這裏呢? 如何……”

So, finally, you know, though, we took good care of Texas.  Is that right?

所以，最終，妳知道，我們把德克薩斯照顧得很好。是這樣嗎?

PASTOR MORRIS:  Yes, sir.

**莫里斯牧師：**是的，先生。

THE PRESIDENT:  We took such good care of Texas.  They were looking for the next hurricane.  They said, “When’s the next hurricane?”  (Laughter and applause.)  But they had a big one.  And they say you had the largest water dump ever.  It just didn’t stop.  It came in, and you thought it was gone, and then it went back out and it reloaded, right?  And it happened three times.

總統： 我們把德州照顧得很好。他們在尋找下一次颶風。他們說，“下一次颶風是什麽時候?”(笑聲和掌聲) 但他們有一個大的。他們說這裏有有史以來最大的排水口。它沒有停止。它進來了，你以為它不見了，然後它又回來了，重新裝上子彈，對吧?這樣的事發生了三次。

And your governor came, and he wanted to build a barrier so that water would hit the barrier, it wouldn’t come into certain parts of Texas.  He called me, he said, “Sir, I just have one more request.”  This is after we gave $28 billion.  So, $28 billion.  I mean, we watch the pennies, but when it comes to Texas, we don’t watch them too closely, okay?  (Laughter and applause.)

你們的州長來了，他想建造一道屏障，這樣水就不會碰到屏障，流入德克薩斯州的某些地區。他打電話給我說，“先生，我還有一個請求。這是在我們提供了280億美元之後。因此,280億美元。我的意思是，我們會看硬幣，但當涉及到德州時，我們不會看得太仔細，好嗎?(笑聲和掌聲)。

And he said — Governor Abbott — he said, “Just one more request, and it’s a very small one, sir.  We have a way of building a wall.  It goes up and down.  It moves with the tides.”  I said, “That sounds expensive to me.”  “It moves with the tides, and it’s not a lot of money.  Could I ask you to do me one small favor and approve it?”  I said, “How much is it?”  “Sir, it’s only $10 billion.”  (Laughter.)  And I said, “Start working on it.”  Right?  I said, “Start working on it,” because we can do things to get rid of those.

阿博特州長，他說，“先生，再提一個請求，這是一個很小的請求，我們有辦法建造一堵墻。”它上下波動。它隨潮汐而動。我說:“聽起來挺貴的。”“它隨潮流而動，而且錢不多。能不能請你幫我一個小忙，批準一下?我說:“多少錢?””“先生，只有100億美元。”(笑聲)。我說，“開始做吧。“對吧?我說，“開始做吧，”因為我們可以做一些事情來擺脫它們。

You have some — you get hit pretty hard here.  They get hit pretty hard here, don’t they?  Were you affected very much when you had — during the hurricanes itself?

這裏會受到很大的沖擊。他們在這裏受到了很大的打擊，不是嗎?在颶風期間，你受到了很大的影響嗎?

PASTOR MORRIS:  We had a lot of people who were displaced that came to this area.

**莫里斯牧師：**我們有很多流離失所的人來到這個地區

THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Well, we took good care of everybody.

**川普總統：**是的。 嗯，我們照顧好每一個人。

PASTOR MORRIS:  Yes, you did.

**莫里斯牧師：**是的，您做到了。

THE PRESIDENT:  So, I just want to say this is one of my favorite places.  I know we’re doing very well here.

**川普總統：**所以，我只想說這是我最喜歡的地方之一。我知道我們在這裏做得很好。

During the last process, they kept saying that Texas was too close to call.  And friends of mine in Texas would say, “It’s not too close to call.  You’re going to win in a landslide.”  And I said, “Well, they keep saying…” — (applause).  They had — one man got on television, actually, and he said, “I don’t know where you come from, but I don’t think this is too close to call.  I think he’s going to win by a lot.”  We won by a lot.  It was eight o’clock and the polls were closed.  And they said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.”  (Applause.)  And he said it simultaneously.  So —

在最後的投票過程中，他們一直在說德州的選票差距太大，勝負難分。我在德州的朋友們會說:“這並不難分勝負。”妳會贏得壓倒性的勝利。我說:“嗯，他們一直在說……”(掌聲)有一個人出現在電視上，他說，“我不知道妳從哪裏來，但我認為這並不難分出勝負。我認為他會贏很多。”我們贏了很多。他們說，“唐納德·川普贏得了德克薩斯州。”(掌聲)。他同時說了出來。所以- – –

And we’re doing good here again, but, you know, one of the things, I have to say — because this is big oil territory — I think we’ve done a fantastic job with bringing back the oil in a rapid fashion.  That looked pretty bad.  That’d look pretty bad.  (Applause.)

我們在這裏又做得很好，但是，妳知道，其中一件事，我不得不說： 因為這是一個大的石油領域我認為我們在迅速恢復石油方面做得很好。那時看起來很糟糕。看起來很糟糕。(掌聲)。

You had a case — you had a couple of hours where if you bought a barrel of oil, you bought it for $37 — as if they gave you $37.  Okay?  There’s never been a thing like that ever.  And now I see that it’s getting close to $40 a barrel and you’re back in business, and we got it done fast and we got Russia together with Saudi Arabia, and they cut production.  And they got it back fast, and we’re very, very proud of it.

有一種情況，你有幾個小時，如果你買一桶石油，花37美元買，就好像他們給你37美元。好吧?從來沒有過這樣的事。現在我看到油價已經接近每桶40美元，妳又回到了正軌，我們很快就解決了這個問題，我們讓俄羅斯和沙特阿拉伯一起減產。他們很快就把它拿了回來，我們為此非常、非常自豪。

The supply changed rapidly with COVID-19, or whatever you want to call it.  I had never heard so many names.  You have about 30 names you can call this thing.  (Laughter.)  All I — I call it “the plague from China.”  (Laughter.)  “The plague.”  (Laughter and applause.)  And it’s not good.  And it’s not good.  And it’s — it could have been stopped.  It could have been stopped in China, but they decided not to do that.  And we’ll have to figure that one out, won’t we?

隨著COVID-19的出現，供應發生了迅速變化，或者你想叫它什麽都行。我從來沒聽過這麽多名字。你可以給它起30個名字。(笑聲)。我把它叫做“中國的瘟疫”。(笑聲)“瘟疫。”(笑聲和掌聲)這是不好的。這是不好的。它本來可以被阻止的。它本可以在中國被阻止，但他們決定不這麽做。我們必須弄清楚這一點，不是嗎?

So I just want to thank everybody very much for being here.  This is a very spectacular place.  And I want to introduce Attorney General Barr and Secretary Carson to say a few words, along with the Surgeon General, who has been a real young star in the administration.  And, please, if I could, Bill?  Take over, please.  Thank you very much.

所以我想感謝在座的各位。這是一個非常壯觀的地方。我想請巴爾司法部長和卡森部長說幾句話，還有衛生局局長，他是政府中真正的年輕明星。還有，如果我可以的話，比爾? 請接著往下說。非常感謝。

(Attorney General) William Barr: Thank you, Mr. President.

謝謝總統先生。

Donald Trump: Thank you.

**川普總統：** 謝謝。

Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for convening this discussion. And I’d like to thank the many impressive leaders, civic leaders, religious leaders and colleagues from law enforcement that are here. That ghastly spectacle in Minneapolis was really jarring to the whole nation. And it forced us to confront and think about reflect on longstanding issues in our nation. Those issues obviously relate to the relationship between law enforcement and the African- American community. But just to step back a little and take a broader view initially, I’ve been thinking about how do we achieve the full American dream for rural communities, African-American communities, all communities. And one of the reasons I’m proud to serve in this administration is because I think the president is moving forward on the critical elements necessary to provide and ensure that opportunity.

William Barr總檢察長：总统先生，謝謝您，也謝謝您召開這次討論會。 我還要感謝這里許多令人印象深刻的領導人、公民領袖、宗教領袖和執法部門的同事。 明尼阿波利斯那場可怕的景象確實使整個國家感到震驚，它迫使我們面對和思考，反思我們國家長期存在的問題。 這些問題顯然和執法部門與非裔美國人社區之間的關係有關。 但是，讓我們後退一步，放寬視野，我一直在思考如何為包括鄉村社區、非裔美國人社區在內的所有社區實現完整的美國夢。 我為在本屆政府任職感到自豪的原因之一是，我認為總統正在積極推進提供和確保此機會的必不可少的關鍵要素。

First and foremost, economic growth. Without growth there is no opportunity.

首先是經濟增長。沒有經濟增長的就沒有機會。

Second, education. I think Condi Rice said a few years ago it’s the civil rights issue of our time. Because without a good education, we are not allowing our young people to seize their opportunities and pursue their dreams.

第二是教育。 我想康迪·賴斯（Condi Rice）幾年前曾說過，這是我們這個時代的民權問題。 因為如果沒有受過良好的教育，我們的年輕人就無法抓住機會、追求自己的夢想。

And as the president mentioned, it’s only by empowering parents and giving them the power to choose the education for their children that we’re ever going to be able to obtain that.

正如總統所說，只有通過賦予父母權力，並賦予他們為子女選擇教育的權力，我們才能獲得這種教育。

Third, I think is moral discipline. And our young people, they have to have the discipline to seize the opportunity to make momentary sacrifices for later gain. And traditionally that has come and people can find it perhaps from many sources, but traditionally that has come from religion, which our founders believed was the foundation of our republic. And we have to stop policies that undermine religion or relegate religion out of the public square.

第三，我認為是道德紀律。 而我們的年輕人，他們必須自律，要抓住機會，犧牲暫時的享受，以便以後獲得更大的利益。也許人們可以從許多來源找到，但從傳統上講，它來自於宗教信仰。我們國家的創建者認為這是我們共和的基礎。 而且我們必須停止破壞宗教，或將宗教信仰放逐出公共場所的政策。

Now I get to my job which is safety. Without safety you cannot have progress. You can’t have a life, a decent life in a community. And, you know, this was struck home to me 30 years ago when I visited Trenton when I was attorney general last time I went to a small barbershop in an African-American neighborhood. And there were people there in their sixties and seventies， and they said, “Mr. Barr we’re in our golden years and we are living behind bars. Look down the street, all the bars are on our windows and the criminals run free on the street.”

但是現在我要談我的本職工作，那就是安全。 沒有安全，就不會有進步。 你就無法過上體面的生活。 而且，你們知道，在30年前，當我上次擔任總檢察長時，我在特倫頓（Trenton）的經歷深深地刺痛了我。 我去了一個非裔美國人社區的一家小型理髮店。在那的人都是 60，70 歲的，他們說： 巴爾，我們正值壯年，卻只能在牢中渡過。看看街上，罪惡橫行，所有的窗戶上都裝上了防護欄。”

Now, we’ve made a lot of progress since then. The crime rate has been cut in half and a big part of that has been improvement in policing, and the progress we’ve made in policing, and, yes, the progress that police have made, police departments have made in building relationships with the community.

從那時起，我們取得了很大進步； 犯罪率降低了一半。 其中很大一部分是因為警務方面的改進，以及我們在警務方面取得的進展，對，警察和警務部門在與社區建立關係方面也取得了進展。

I think law enforcement has understood for a long time that there is distrust in the African-American community toward the law enforcement system. And when you reflect on our history, you can understand why. Because for most of our history just up until the last 60 years, the institutions in this country, the laws and the institutions were explicitly discriminatory. There was not equal protection of the law， by law. And it’s only been since Jim Crow that our laws have been changed to provide for equal justice.

我想執法部門很早就已經了解，非洲裔美國人社區對執法系統不信任。 當回顧歷史時，你們會明白為什麼：因為在我們的大部分歷史中，直到最近60年，這個國家的機構、法律和制度都具有明顯的歧視性。 沒有平等的法律保護。 自從吉姆·克羅（Jim Crow）以來，我們的法律才有所更改，以實現平等正義。

And what we’ve had, really, since — and so the Civil Rights effort, up until that time, was to tear down institutions.  But I don’t think now is the time to be tearing down our institutions, because we’ve been on a march for the last 50 years of reforming our institutions, and we don’t need to tear them down.  We have to be mature about this, and when we see problems, we have to redouble our efforts to reform our institutions and make sure they’re in sync with our values.

直到那以前，我們所做的一切，以及民權方面的努力，都是要將這個體系打碎。 但是我認為現在不是要拆毀我們的體系的時候，因為過去50年來，我們一直在進行體系上的改革，我們所要做的不是拆毀它。 我們應當成熟起來，當我們發現問題時，我們必須加倍努力來改革我們的現有體系，並確保它與我們的價值觀保持同步。

And I don’t think anyone who’s honest would deny that we’ve made a lot of progress in policing over the last 50 years.  And, in fact, you know, one of the things about this episode in Minneapolis was how fast both the state and federal law enforcement responded to — to dealing with — with that action.

而且我認為沒有一個誠實的人會否認我們在過去50年中在警務方面取得了很大進步。 而且，從州和聯邦執法部門對明尼阿波利斯的事件快速反應中，大家可以一窺一二。

So I think that while we saw something very bad, it has helped perhaps galvanize the will of the country to bring good out of that. And we can’t let that incident obscure the fact that progress has been made, that policemen are by and large by overwhelming majority good, decent people who care about their community and put their lives on the line for us, the neighbors.

因此，儘管我們看到了非常糟糕的事情發生，但它或許有助於激發我們從危機中得著益處的心。 我們不能讓這一事件掩蓋了在警務方面取得了很大進步的事實； 總體上，絕大多數的警察是好的，善良的人，他們關心他們的社區，並用生命來保護他們的鄰捨。

And we can’t lose sight of the fact we can’t let this event obscure the fact that the real oppression and danger to our communities comes more from violent crime and lawlessness than it does from the police.

我們不能忽視一個事實，也不能讓這一事件掩蓋這個事實，那就是對我們社區的真正壓迫和危險更多是來自暴力犯罪和違法行為，而不是來自警察。

Now, we’ve never — we’ve never had — we’ve never had a President who is more committed to reforming law enforcement.  And he’s done that with the FIRST STEP Act and with the first police commission since Lyndon Johnson.  And I’m very optimistic about, you know, what we’re going to be able to do — given his leadership, but also given the leadership of our police forces, which around the country increasingly have become better and better led.

如今，我們從來沒有，我們從未有過，我們從未有過一位總統更致力於執法機構的改革。 而且他是通過《第一步法案》，以及成立自林登·約翰遜以來的第一個警察委員會來做到這一點的。 而且，對我們將能夠做到什麼，我是非常樂觀的，因為在他還有警察部隊的領導下，全國各地的情況會越來越好。

And the — I think the police profession is itself committed to addressing the issues that we saw in Minneapolis and completing the process of professionalizing policing in this country.

我認為警察職業本身就是致力於解決我們看到在明尼阿波利斯的問題，並且致力於完成我國警務專業化進程。

And, as the President said, we’re working on a number of things through the commission that he set up and also through an executive order to propel that process even faster by looking at how we can encourage the adoption of guidelines about the use of force that are acceptable, both to the community and to the — and to the police profession, but also to encourage certification of police forces, and also through such activities as increasing grants to encourage the use of co-responders.

而且，正如總統所說，我們正在通過他設立的委員會以及行政命令，通過研究我們如何鼓勵採用可以被社區和警察雙方接受的關於實用武力的指導方針， 通過鼓勵對警察部隊進行認證，還可以通過增加補助金等活動來鼓勵使用共同回應者來加快此進程。

More and more, our police are being asked to deal with problems that — that, you know, hasn’t previously been the problem of law enforcement.  They have to deal with homeless people.  They have to deal with a lot of mental health issues.  They have to deal with, you know, drug addiction, the drug addicts, and so forth.  And providing some additional support to the police in these areas is going to be important.

越來越多地，我們的警察被要求處理一些問題，而這些問題以前都不歸執法部門處理。 他們必須與無家可歸者打交道。 他們必須處理很多心理健康問題。 他們必須處理吸毒、吸毒者等等。 在這些領域向警察提供更多支持也是非常重要的。

So let me just say that the department of justice is committed to support the president’s efforts here, do all we can to bring good out of this bad incident. Thank you.

因此，我只想說，司法部全力支持總統在這裡的努力，我們將竭盡所能，從這場不幸事件有所收穫。謝謝。

Donald Trump: Thank you Barr, thank you. Surgeon general please go ahead. Do you want to go?

**川普總統：**謝謝巴爾，謝謝。衛生部部長該你了。

Surgeon general Jerome Adams: All right.

**衛生局局長 杰羅姆·亞當斯：**好的

Donald Trump: Good. Go ahead.

**川普總統：**好的。請。

Jerome Adams：Well, thank you Mr. President I appreciate it. Thank you, everyone, for coming today. Thank you to the panelists.

**杰罗姆·亚当斯：** 謝謝總統先生，謝謝。 謝謝大家今天的到來。 謝謝與會嘉賓。

I just want to start off by saying that many people across the country and across the great state of Texas are hurting right now due to the tragedy that occurred to George Floyd.  And I just want to extend my condolences to the Floyd family and to the entire Texas community, because I know that you all live together, you work together, you play together, and you hurt together here in Texas.  And so, I want you to know that I feel that for you.

我首先想說，由於喬治·弗洛伊德所發生的悲劇，全國各地以及得克薩斯州的許多州現在正在受到傷害。 我想向弗洛伊德一家以及整個德克薩斯社區表示慰問，因為我知道你們在德克薩斯州的所有人生活在一起，工作在一起，活動在一起，也一同受到傷害。 因此，我希望你們知道我與你們有同感。

The president asked me to give you a quick update on America’s COVID-19 response. Thanks to cooperation with state and local partners we’re making progress against the virus, we are and towards a safe reopening.

總統要求我向你們簡要介紹美國對COVID-19的應對。 多虧了與州和地方合作夥伴的合作，我們在抵抗病毒方面取得了進展-我們正朝著安全重新開放的方向前進。

Through strong public and private partnerships, America has now done more than 20 million tests. And that number is a big number, it’s not just about the number it’s also about how many of those tests are coming back positive. We have a positive rate under 6% nationally and from a public health perspective if we’re under 10% positive, we’re doing a good job.

通過強大的公私合作夥伴關係，美國現在已經進行了超過2000萬次測試。 這個數字是很大的。 不只是測試數字， 這還涉及到其中有多少測試的結果呈陽性。 我們在全國范圍內的陽性率低於6％。 從公共衛生的角度來看，如果我們的陽性率不足10％，那麼我們就做得很好。

So there’s a lot of challenges out there, but I want you all to know that we are moving in the right direction. The data shows that we are moving in the right direction as a nation.

因此，這裡有很多挑戰，但我希望大家都知道我們正在朝著正確的方向前進。 數據表明，我們作為一個國家正在朝著正確的方向前進。

And this has happened in part thanks to opening of over 500 community based testing sites through the work of private sector partners in the United States public health service, which I helped lead with Admiral Giroir. 70% of those sites are in CDC designated vulnerable areas. That means that we’re taking the testing to those who need it the most, to those who are most at risk. We also have testing at 92% of America’s community health centers, which predominantly served low income areas and communities of color.

之所以如此，部分原因是由於通過私營部門合作夥伴和美國公共衛生服務局（US Public Health Service）的工作開設了500多個基於社區的測試站點，而我協助吉羅爾海軍上將領導了這一工作。 這些站點中有70％位於CDC指定的易感染區域。 這意味著我們正在將測試提供給最需要它的人，也給那些面臨最大風險的人。 我們還在92％的美國社區衛生中心進行了測試，這些中心主要為低收入地區和有色人種提供服務。

We’ve helped equip our frontline workers, our healthcare heroes with 94 million N95 respirators, 149 million surgical masks and more than a billion gloves. And a large proportion of those supplies at the president and the secretary’s direction are going to nursing homes.

我們已經幫助一線工作人員、醫療英雄們配備了9400只N95口罩，1.49億個外科口罩和超過10億隻手套。 在總統和部長的指示下，這些用品中的很大一部分將用於養老院。

And I just want to — I see the governor over there.  I want to give you all a shout-out.  Texas has led the way in nursing home testing.  A hundred percent of their nursing homes have been tested.  They’re leading the way in testing people in corrections facilities.  Over 95 percent of people in corrections facilities have been tested.  And that is something you all should be tremendously proud of.

我看到州長坐在那邊。 我為你們感到驕傲。 德克薩斯州在為養老院測試中處於領先地位。 你們的療養院中100％都進行了測試。 在對懲教人員的測試中，你們也名列前茅。有超過95％的懲教人已進行了測試。 這就是大家都應該為之驕傲的事情。

And these efforts have allowed states to proceed with a safe reopening, while we work with states to monitor the incoming data.  We know we’re going to have clusters, but while we respond to spikes, and we adjust policies as needed.

這些努力使各州得以安全地重新開放。而我們與各州合作來密切注視最新的數據。 我們知道我們將會有很多的聚會，但我們會根據需要調整政策以應對高峰。

But I want you to know that safe reopening is crucial for other areas in health too.  We need Americans to be able to return to cancer screenings.  My wife just finished cancer treatment.  If she’d had to wait six months to get her cancer screened, she might not be here today.  We need people to get their surgeries.  We need people to get their vaccinations.  4.2 million children are behind on vaccinations now because of the COVID closures.  We know every 1 percent increase in unemployment equates to a 1.3 percent increase in suicides.  1.3 percent increase in suicides.

但我想讓你們知道安全的重開對其他健康領域也至關重要。 美國人需要能夠重新進行癌症篩查。 我妻子剛剛完成癌症治療。 如果她不得不等待六個月才能篩查癌症，那麼她今天可能不在這裡。 人們需要進行手術。人們需要可以接種疫苗。 由於COVID而引發的停業，目前有420萬兒童無法接種疫苗。 我們知道失業率每增加1％，自殺人數就增加1.3％。 自殺人數增加1.3％呀。

So we want to reopen safely.  We also have to remember that being shut down has health consequences beyond COVID.  We know that being out of school is bad for your health.  We need to get our kids back in school safely.  I have a 15-, a 14-, and a 10-year-old.  And so, can you tell I’ve been saying that a lot?

因此，我們需要安全的重開。 我們還必須記住，關閉會對健康產生超出COVID的後果。 我們知道，孩子們不上學對你們的健康有害。 我們需要讓孩子們安全返回學校。我有15歲，14歲和10歲的孩子。 因此，你知道我談論這些太多次了。

But we know that COVID-19 has a tragically disproportionate burden on communities of color. Black Americans hospitalized at 4.5 times higher rates than whites. Hospitalization rates 3.5 times higher for Hispanics than whites and five times higher for American-Indians and Alaska natives.

但是我們知道，COVID-19對有色人種群體造成了悲慘且不成比例的負擔：美國黑人的住院率是白人的4.5倍； 西班牙裔美國人的住院率是白人的3.5倍，美洲印第安人和阿拉斯加土著人的住院率是白人的5倍。

The fact is this virus is exploiting and exacerbating preexisting health disparities.  And these disparate outcomes and opportunities for health are, in part, the anger, the frustration, and the fear that we’re seeing manifest in protests around the country.

事實是這種病毒正在激发並加劇先前存在的健康差異。 這些不同的結果和获取健康的機會差异部分是因為憤怒，沮喪和對我們在全國各地的抗議活動中表現出來的恐懼。

And that’s why it’s important for people to know that beyond talking about the problem at the president’s direction at secretary Azar’s direction, HHS and the white house opportunity and revitalization council or WHORC are focusing resources on minority communities.

因此，重要的是讓人們知道，除了談論問題之外，還應遵循總統的指示，按照阿扎爾部长的指示，HHS和白宮機會與振興委員會或WHORC將資源集中在少數族裔群體上。

HHS recently allocated $15 billion to Medicaid providers and $10 billion to safety net hospitals, both groups of providers that disproportionately serve Americans of color.  And I spent the last 10 years working at a safety net hospital –Eskenazi Hospital in Indianapolis.  I can tell you those are the places that are doing the work.  Those are the places that, at President’s direction, we’re focusing our resources towards.

HHS最近向醫療補助提供商分配了150億美元，為安全網醫院分配了100億美元，這兩類服務提供商分別為有色美國人群提供服務。 在過去的10年中，我在印第安納波利斯的一家安全網醫院（Eskenazi Hospital）工作。 我可以告訴你们，正是這些地方在開展工作。 在總統的指導下，我們將資源集中供应這些地方。

We’re working with a consortium — with the consortium of black medical schools to fund and scale local efforts in communities that, again, reach communities of color.  CDC now requires all testing data reported by states include information on race, ethnicity, and zip code so we can continue to further refine and focus our strategy on the hardest-hit communities.

我們正在與一個財團合作-與黑人醫學院校財團合作，資助並擴大社區的本地工作，包含有色人群社區。 CDC現在要求各州報告的所有測試數據包括有關種族，種族和郵政編碼的信息，因此我們可以繼續進一步完善我們的策略，並將其重點放在受災最嚴重的社區。

CMS is deregulating telemedicine to make ongoing care for many medical conditions safe, accessible, and convenient for the patients and for healthcare professionals.  Again, we can’t afford to let people continue to go without their care.  And the administration’s emphasis on public-private partnerships is allowing us to progress towards a vaccine and treatments at a record pace as a part of Operation Warp Speed.

CMS正在放鬆遠程醫療的監管，使醫療保健專業人員可以安全，有效且方便地為患者提供多種醫療狀況下的日常護理。 重申一下，我們不能讓人們失去應有的看顧。 政府對公私合作夥伴關係的重視使我們能夠以創紀錄的速度向疫苗和治療邁進，這是“快速行動”的一部分。

I want to add that SAMHSA has just funded three community behavioral health clinics right here in Texas with the CARES Act funding.  Some of your congressional representatives are here.  I want to say thank you to you all for passing that and to the President for signing it to address COVID-19 and behavioral health needs.  These facilities integrate mental health, substance abuse treatment, and physical healthcare in one setting, and provide 24/7 crisis intervention services.

我要補充一點，SAMHSA剛剛在CARES法案的資助下，在德克薩斯州這裡資助了三家社區行為健康診所。 你們的一些國會代表也在這裡。 我想對大家表示感謝，並感謝總統簽署該協議可以應對COVID-19和行為健康的需要。 這些設施將心理健康，藥物濫用治療和身體保健整合在一處，並提供24/7全天候危機干預服務。

Another notable Mental Health Awareness Training grant is in Austin, where funds are used to train community health officials, including law enforcement.  And we have many of them in the crowd today on recognizing signs and symptoms of mental illness and mental health crises, and how to help an individual who’s struggling.  That’s all part of — of reform.  That’s all part of reform in the positive direction, giving our frontline workers the tools and the training they need to be able to take care of these difficult situations.

另一個著名的心理健康意識培訓撥款是在奧斯丁，用於培訓社區衛生官員，包括執法人員。 今天，他們許多人就在我們中間，他們在學習識別精神疾病和精神健康危機的體徵和症狀，以及如何幫助處於困境的個人。 這就是改革的一部分。 這是積極改革的全部內容，為我們的一線工作人員提供了應對這些困難情況所需的工具和培訓。

As Mayor Sylvester Turner said at George Floyd’s funeral, we must encourage business leaders to invest in our underserved communities.  And that’s what the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council is all about.  I have an upcoming Surgeon General’s report on community health and economic prosperity, which aims to mobilize businesses to invest deeply and over time in the health of their communities.

正如市長西爾維斯特·特納在喬治·弗洛伊德的葬禮上說的那樣，我們必須鼓勵商業領袖對服務欠佳的社區進行投資。 這就是白宮機會與振興委員會的宗旨。 我即將發布一份有關與社區健康和經濟繁榮的衛生部長報告，該報告旨在動員企業對社區的健康進行長期的深入投資。

Finally, to focus on chronic conditions that disproportionately impact black and brown people and may worsen because of COVID, Secretary Azar has instructed my office to accelerate the release of two calls to action: the first on maternal health — addressing the fact that women of color suffer more complications and a much higher risk of dying around childbirth.  Black women are four to five times more likely to die around childbirth than white women.  Native American women are more likely to die around childbirth than white women.  And that’s after you control for income, after you control for education, after you control for every known factor that we — that we have.

最後，為了關注那些嚴重影響黑人和棕色人群且可能因COVID而惡化的慢性病，阿扎爾部長指示我的辦公室加快發布兩個行動呼籲：第一個涉及孕產婦的保健，解決有色人群女性的遭受更多的並發症，分娩時死亡的風險更高的事實。 黑人婦女在分娩時死亡的可能性是白人婦女的四到五倍。 美國原住民婦女比白人婦女死於分娩的可能性更高。 這項研究結果是在考慮了收入，教育，以及我們所知的每個已知因素之後得出的。

My second call to action is on hypertension control for all Americans.  Hypertension is common, it’s costly, and it’s treatable.  And yet, control rates are low and stalled, especially in communities of color.

我的第二個行動呼籲是控制所有美國人的高血壓。 高血壓很常見，治療費用昂貴，而且可以治愈的。 但是，控制率很低而且停滯不前，尤其是在有色人種群體中。

So I just want to close by saying that, as we reopen, the basic public health recommendations we’ve emphasized remain important.  We flattened the curve, but that doesn’t mean that COVID has gone away, that it’s any less contagious, that it’s any less deadly to vulnerable communities.

最後，我想說的是，當我們重新開放時，我們強調的基礎公共衛生建議仍然很重要。 我們使曲線變平，但這並不意味著COVID消失了，沒有那麼具有傳染性了，對易感染社區的致命性降低了。

So if you don’t want to listen to me, listen to Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan.  Nolan Ryan filmed a PSA at the governor’s direction.  And he said, number one, wash your hands.  Wash them more than you’ve ever watched them before in your life.

因此，如果你們不想听我的話，請聽名人堂投手諾蘭·瑞安（Nolan Ryan）的講話。 諾蘭·瑞安在州長的指導下拍攝了PSA。 他說，第一，洗手。 洗手的次數比你在一輩子看過他們的次數還要多。

Number two, follow your local and state guidelines around social distancing.  This virus likes to spread person to person.  So the more we can keep distance between people, especially people we don’t know, the harder it is for this virus to transmit.

第二，遵循地方和州有關社交距離的準則。 該病毒喜歡在人與人之間傳播。 因此，我們與人之間（尤其是我們不認識的人）保持距離越遠，這種病毒就越難得以傳播。

And number three — this isn’t me speaking; this is Nolan Ryan, Hall of Fame pitcher here.  (Laughter.)  When you’re in a public place where it’s difficult to keep a distance, like the grocery or pharmacy, the CDC recommends wearing a face covering to protect your neighbors in the event that you have COVID and you don’t know it.  Up to 50 percent of people who have COVID are asymptomatic.

第三，這不是我說的； 是名人堂投手諾蘭·瑞安。當您在雜貨店或藥房等難以與外界保持距離的公共場所時，疾病預防控制中心建議您戴面罩以保護你的鄰捨。 以防你中了COVID，但您不知道。多達50％的COVID患者是無症狀的。

So thanks to the hard work of so many healthcare and public health professionals and the commitment of the American people, I want to reiterate, because you don’t hear this enough, that we are making huge progress in the fight against COVID-19.  And as a member of the task force, I can tell you that we frequently talk about the great work Texas has been doing up until this point to keep the people of Texas safe, to keep the most vulnerable members of their community safe.  And with every American’s help, with your help, Texas, we’ll keep making progress.  We’re going to beat this virus.

感謝眾多醫療保健和公共衛生專業人員的辛勤工作以及美國人民的付出，我想重申一下，因為你們聽得還不夠，我們在抗擊COVID-19方面取得了巨大進展。 作為工作組的成員，我可以告訴你，我們經常談論得德薩斯州在此之前所取得的極大的成就，從而確保了得克薩斯州人民的安全，確保了社區中最脆弱的成員的安全。 在每個美國人的幫助下，在德克薩斯州的幫助下，我們將不斷取得進步。 我們將戰勝這個病毒。

And thank you for the opportunity, Mr. President.  Thank you, Texas.

總統先生，也感謝您提供的機會。 謝謝德克薩斯。

Donald Trump: Thank you very much [inaudible 00:48:44]. Ben Carson, please, man.
**川普總統：**非常感謝，本·卡森，請講。

Ben Carson: Okay, well, thank you Mr. President, for your leadership and your courage. I don’t know of anybody who could stand up to all the criticism you get every day, 24 [crosstalk 00:49:04].

**本·卡森：**好的，謝謝您,總統先生，謝謝您的領導力和勇氣。我不知道有誰能像您一樣每天忍受那麼多非難。

Donald Trump: Do we have a choice? Thank you.
**川普總統：**難道我們還有選擇的嗎？謝謝。

Ben Carson: Our nation is continuing to a path of renewal, or recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, but since the beginning, president has talked about being a champion for the forgotten men and women of this nation. That’s exactly where we’ve been concentrating, and it’s been an honor to serve in an administration with that goal, and I’m excited to see America beginning to bounce back. The infrastructure, the economic infrastructure of our country is very strong, secondary to the abolition of multitudinous regulations, and targeted tax cuts. It’s still there. That foundation is there, and we will be able to get back on that track pretty quickly, but to help speed this rebound, the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council was formed to really help the long forgotten communities achieve economic opportunity.

**本·卡森：**我們的國家正在從新冠疫情中繼續更新和恢復。自從總統一上任，就一直談論著要做為被遺忘的群體爭利益的宣導者。這正是我們一直專注的方面。能夠在以此為目標的政府中任職是一種榮幸。我很高興看到美國開始復甦。基礎設施方面，我國的經濟基礎設施非常強大，更勝一籌的是，我們廢除了眾多繁瑣法規和有針對性的減稅。我們的經濟基礎仍然屹立著。有了這個基礎，我們將能夠很快重回正軌。但是為了加速恢復元氣，我們成立了白宮機會與振興委員會，用以真正幫助長期被遺忘的社區獲得經濟機會。

And, it has been refocused at your direction to help America’s hardest hit communities achieve economic recovery, overcome health disparities, and thrive through educational and workforce advancement. Now, to stimulate economic development and entrepreneurship, the council has worked to set aside additional payment protection funding for our nation’s low income minority communities, and provided technical support to help these communities to access this funding. They have stated that during the first round the money wasn’t getting to them. We are addressing that, and I want to thank all the different agencies, virtually, every governmental agency has contributed significantly to refocusing and addressing these problems.

而且，在總統先生的指導下，這已經被重新鎖定為重心，用以幫助美國受災最嚴重的社區實現經濟復蘇，消除健康差距，從而讓教育和人力資源提升。現在，為了刺激經濟發展和企業家精神，該委員會已為低收入少數民族社區預留額外的支付保護資金，並提供技術支援以幫助這些社區來獲取資金。他們曾說在第一輪資助中，資金最後沒有到位，我們正在處理這個問題。我要感謝很多機構。幾乎每個政府機構都為重新定位和解決這些問題做出了重大貢獻。

The groundbreaking initiative known as Opportunity Zones, which encourages longterm investment in the forgotten communities will also be expanded to include more of the underserved areas. Another major initiative, improving health and public safety comes with several administrative and legislative proposals. For example, we believe both telemedicine and increased use of mobile care can be major catalyst in our mission to overcome health disparities and underserved communities. Those are things that can actually be done very rapidly to bring healthcare to people who’ve previously been neglected.

“機會區”項目是鼓勵在被遺忘的社區中進行長期投資的突破性舉措，也將擴大到許多服務匱乏的地區。另一項重大舉措是，改善健康和公共安全，包括多項行政和立法建議。例如，我們認為遠端醫療和移動醫療都可以在我們消除服務匱乏社區的健康差距的使命中，作為強有力的催化劑。

這些舉措實際上可以非常快地完成，以便為以前被忽視的群體提供醫療服務。

And, to further this effort, we’re also committed to reforming the infrastructure of our public health data system, addressing chronic conditions, and at risk populations, and working to address food, and security, and underserved communities. That means healthy foods at reasonable prices that are accessible, but one of the thing that I just mentioned, the data collection, we have 50 states, and we have territories in Washington, DC, and we have all of those many different healthcare collection systems, and we are working to homogenize all of that, and we’ll make it much easier for us to identify quickly health issues, and to be able to address them very quickly.

在此基礎上跟進一步，我們還將改革我們的公共衛生資料系統的基礎架構，用以解決高風險人群中的慢性病問題，以及解決服務匱乏社區的食品不能保障的問題。這意味著大家可以買到健康食品，而且是能承受的合理價格。我剛提到的一件事是資料獲取，我們有50個州及華盛頓特區，但都是不同的醫療保健採集系統。我們正在努力統一標準化，這樣我們將更容易快速識別健康問題，並快速解決問題。

Other legislative proposals, such as advancing national broadband access, and investment, and minority serving medical institutions will also play a major role in improving the wellbeing of these forgotten communities. Making sure that we have broadband access will give access to remote learning. We will have the possibility of taking a very best biology teacher, and instead of putting him in front of 30 students, putting in front of a million students, so that those students who’ve been neglected during all this time, and relegated to places where they’re not getting an appropriate education will be able to access those things, but to guarantee the fruits of these efforts, and that they’re long lasting, we understand the need to go forward with a longterm view through our focus on education and workforce development.
其他立法建議，例如促進全國寬頻接進和投資，以及為少數族裔服務的醫療機構，也將在改善這些被遺忘社區的福利方面發揮重要作用。確保我們的社區擁有寬頻存取權限，從而能遠程學習。我們將有可能請最好的生物學老師，不是在僅30名學生面前，而是在一百萬名學生面前講課，以便那些一直被忽視以至於被後退到不能有適當教育機會的學生們，也能獲得適黨的教育。但是為了保證這些努力能出成果，並保障持久性，我們深知要立足於對教育和人力資源的發展，這是長遠計畫。

Education and workforce development is what leads to real independence for people, and the council supports empowering disadvantaged students with dual enrollment opportunities, the creation of new short term education and career pathways, and increase access to capital for our nations [inaudible 00:54:04] use. School choice measures, presidential scholarships, and second chance Pell Grants to reintegrate formerly incarcerated individuals, are initiatives that will prove valuable investments in our country’s human capital, and we must remember these innovative new approaches in education and workforce development are nothing less than an investment in our future. We only have 330 million people in this country. Sounds like a lot of people, but compared to China, it’s a quarter of what they have, India, it’s a quarter of what they have.
有了教育和人力資源的發展才能使人們真正獨立。委員會支持為處境不利的學生提供雙重入學機會，創造新的短期教育和職業培訓道路，為HBCU(黑人傳統學院和大學)增加獲得資本的機會。擇校措施、總統獎學金和佩爾第二機會助學金(Second Chance Pell) 將被給予那些被關押人員，用以重新給他們再度融入社會的機會。這將證明是對我國人力資本的寶貴投資，我們必須記住，這些創新的教育和勞動力發展舉措更是在投資我們的未來。這個國家只有3.3億人。聽起來很多人，但是與中國相比，這是他們的四分之一，也是印度的四分之一。

And, we have to compete with them in the future. We need to develop all of our people and education in particular played a big role in my development. I was not a particularly good student, and that’s putting it mildly. Everybody thought I was stupid, except my mother. She was always saying, “Benjamin, you can bring home much better grades than this.” But, I would agree that I could, but I didn’t, but interestingly enough, my mother studied the homes that she claimed as a domestic. She came from nothing my mother, 24 children, got married when she was 13, dire poverty, discovered her husband was a bigamous, but she was still smart enough to study those people who had these beautiful homes, and she figured that the reason they did so well it’s because they were well educated, and they read a lot, and they didn’t watch a lot of TV.

而我們將來必須與他們競爭。所以我們需要發展我們所有人。教育在我個人發展中尤其發揮了重要作用。我以前不是一個優等生，這也許都說得都有點輕了。人們都說我愚鈍，除了我母親。她一直說：“本傑明，你應當拿回更好成績的。” 我同意我本來可以做到，但我並沒做到。但是很有趣的是，我的母親幫別人家清潔，她就研究那些家庭…她一無所有，24歲時就有幾個孩子，她13歲時結婚，赤貧，還發現她的丈夫犯了重婚。但是她有股子聰明勁來研究那些擁有這些美麗房屋的人們，她認識到他們之所以過得這麼好，是因為他們受過良好教育，並且讀很多書，而且他們很少看電視。

So, she came home and imposed that on me and my brother, and we were not happy campers let me tell you. If it were today’s world we would have called social services, and they’d taken her away, but what a difference it made starting to focus on education, starting to read books, to read about people from lots of different backgrounds, entrepreneurs, and scientists, and explorers, and surgeons. I began to recognize that the person who has the most to do with what happens to you is you, it’s not somebody else, and nobody can stop you once you decide that, that is the case. And, that’s why with the council, there is so much emphasis on education, because it doesn’t matter where you came from, you get a good education, and you write your own ticket. We must reject those people who are trying to prevent school choice, who are trying to prevent the presidential scholarships, all the things that are there to empower people, and you will see a lot of that coming out of this administration, and these investments and innovation give me a tremendous amount of hope for the future of this nation. Mr. President, under your leadership, I’m confident that the American people will emerge stronger from this pandemic, and more determined than ever, and we, the people, will recognize despite all the forces to the contrary that we are not each other’s enemies and…

因此她回到家裡就強迫我和我的兄弟如此（眾笑）我們好不情願呀，讓我告訴你們！如果是當今，我們會打電話給社會服務機構，他們就會把她帶走了！（眾笑）但你們看這教育造成有多大差別呀！一開始就專注於教育，讀書，讀許多不同背景的人的書，有企業家，科學家，探險家和外科醫生。我開始認識到，你最終成為什麽樣的人最重要的決定因素是你自己怎麼做的！不是別人！一旦您意識到這點就沒人能阻止你。（掌聲）這就是為什麼在委員會中如此重視教育，因為這與你來自何方沒關。只要你接受良好的教育你就能走上你所嚮往的成功之路。我們堅決拒絕那些試圖阻止人們擇校，阻止校長獎學金，以及所有阻止賦予人們力量的人或事！你們會看到很多來自政府的相關支持！這些投資和創新使我對這個國家的未來充滿了希望。總統先生。在您的引領下，我堅信美國人民將從疫情大流行中走出來並更強大，並比以往更加堅定。我們人民將意識到，儘管面對眾多阻力，我們從來都不是彼此的敵人（掌聲）

That’s great. Thank you, Ben. That was pretty good. Standing over for Ben. Easiest to that, easiest to it. Great job Ben. He’s done a fantastic job [inaudible 00:58:16]. I have to tell you that. How about Scott? We’ll go quick, Scott. We’ll get [inaudible 00:58:22] Scott Turner, he’s a star. He’s a young star. Go ahead, Scott.
太棒了。謝謝你，本，太棒了！大家請站起來為本致敬。（站立致敬）。太出色了！他在HUD(住房城市發展部)的工作太漂亮了！斯科特在哪？我們很快介紹一下，斯科特。（等候斯科特回應）斯科特·特納，他是年輕的一位明星。請繼續，斯科特。

Well, thank you Mr. President, and thank you for your leadership, and giving me the opportunity to shepherd the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, and so, thank you. It’s also been a great joy to work on a daily basis with Dr. and Secretary Ben Carson, and so, Dr. Carson, thank you for your leadership, and your trust, and confidence in me. I just want to deliver some good news, along with Dr. Carson, everyone on the panel. Oftentimes, you don’t hear about the work of Opportunity Zones, but the Tax Cut and Jobs Act that the president signed into law in 2017, created the Opportunity Zone initiative, and the president created the Opportunity Zone council.
好吧，謝謝總統先生，也感謝您的領導才能，並給我機會讓我領導白宮機會與振興委員會，謝謝。每天能與卡森博士/部長（Ben Carson）一起工作也非常愉悅，卡森（Carson）博士感謝您的領導以及您對我的信任。我在此想和同仁們一起告知一些好消息。通常您不會聽說“機會區”的工作，但是正是總統在2017年簽署的“減稅和就業法案”，創建了“機會區專案”，而且成立了“機會區委員會”。

And, that council was made up to take 18 agencies, 15 federal, and three state, and regional partners, and move in a singular motion to direct resources into our most distressed, vulnerable, forgotten communities, and it’s tremendous time, and so, our agencies on the council direct these resources. We found 270 action items to go directly into distressed communities, to help the vulnerable people of America, and we’ve built tremendous coalitions, partnerships on the ground. We’ve been to over 60 cities. I’ve been to every one of them over the last year to visit people on the ground. Education leaders, faith leaders, community leaders, business leaders, elected officials, Democrat, and Republican.

該委員會有18個機構，包括15個聯邦級別和3個州和地區的合作夥伴。全力以赴一致地將資源引導到我們最窘迫，最脆弱，最被遺忘的社區中。這是個偉大的時刻。我們的委員會調配這些資源。我們現有270個行動步驟，直接注入最受困的社區從而幫助美國的弱勢群體。我們已經在基層建立了龐大的聯盟和夥伴關係。我們去過60多個城市。去年，我去過所有這些地方訪問基層的人們，有教育領袖，信仰領袖，社區領袖，商業領袖，民選官員，民主黨和共和黨人。

See the thing about poverty, it doesn’t care what party you are. The thing about revitalization, it doesn’t care what party you are. We’re coming together as a people for the good of the community, and oftentimes, you may not hear about this, but we sit, and convene, and such as this, with all of these stakeholders at one table to have the hard conversations, what is the pain of the community? Why is the community distressed and what can we do together? Both black and white, Democrat and Republican come together for the good of this community for long term sustainability, for generational impact, and because of that, because of these partnerships, because of this collaboration together, and many people all at this table have been working together to bring about generational impact so long after we’re gone, and history tells the story.

你們看，貧窮這事，不在乎你是什麼黨。振興這事，不在乎你是什麼黨。我們都會團聚在一起，只要是為了能爭取社區的利益。通常，您可能從來沒有聽說過 – 但我們坐下來開會，與所有利益相關者進行針對問題的對話- 社區的痛苦是什麼？為什麼社區感到困苦，我們可以一起做什麼，無論是黑人和白人，民主黨人和共和黨人，為了這個社區的利益而團結在一起，為實現長期的可持續發展，世代相傳的影響？因此，正是由於這些夥伴關係，由於這種合作，許多人都坐在會議桌旁，一直協心努力來實現能世代相傳的好的影響，之後當我們不在這塵世，但歷史會講述這個故事。

The Opportunity Zones is more than just a program. It’s more than just a concept. It is a mission that is to outlast all of us, and I tell you that as you’re here, because a lot of times people see a government program as just a checkered box. This is not a government program. This is built from the grassroots, from the bottom up to affect the people in America. Lastly, Mr. President, I would say tens of billions of dollars have been invested inside of Opportunity Zones, public, private partnerships, Erie, Pennsylvania, St. Louis, Missouri, West Dallas, right here in my great home state of Texas, and other across the nation, much money coming into our distressed communities, and I say all that to say, even though you don’t hear about it often, we have put our hand to the plow and our feet to the ground.

機會區不僅僅是一個項目。這也不只是一個概念，這是一項比我們生命還長存的使命。既然你們在這我就告訴大家，因為很多時候人們看到政府助理在方格子劃上記號。這不僅僅是個政府計畫。它是從草根基層開始，從下而上建立的，而影響美國人民。最後，總統先生，我估計數百億美元已經投入了“機會區“、公私的合作經營中， 比如伊利(賓夕法尼亞州)，聖路易斯(密蘇里州)，西達拉斯 也就是我的家鄉州；以及全國其他地區。很多錢都已湧入我們受困社區。我所有要說的就是，雖然大家不經常聽到這件事，但我們已經將我們的手放在犁上，將我們的腳踏在田地上。

And, all of these things were done prior to COVID, but I want you to know that right now, and post COVID that our spirit remains the same, that our heart is set, our face is set like flint. Our mission is not done, but we’re going to need all of you to pray for us, to walk with us, to convene with us, to invest, to teach. Mr. President, thank you, Dr. Carson, thank you, and to all of my colleagues at the table. Thank you for your support. It’s been a great honor.

而且，所有這些事情都是在COVID之前就完成的，但是我希望大家現在意識到現在，在COVID疫情之後，我們的精神依然盎然，我們的決心依然剛強，我們的面容依然堅毅， 因為我們的使命尚未完成。我們需要所有人為我們祈禱，與我們同行，與我們融聚，一起來投資、教導。總統先生，謝謝！卡森博士，也謝謝您和我在座的所有同仁。謝謝大家支持。不勝榮幸！（掌聲）

Thank you very much. That’s great. Thank you Scott. Great. [inaudible 01:02:36] you want to say something? Please pastor, please.

非常感謝你。很棒。謝謝你斯科特。 您想說些什麼？牧師先生，您請。

Pastor Morris: Well, thank you, Mr. President. I just was thinking about that 30 years ago, I was serving as associate pastor at a small church, and I asked Bishop Harry Jackson to come and teach us on race relations, to teach us what we didn’t know, because we don’t know what we don’t know, and now 30 years later, Bishop Harry and I are sitting on each side of the president of the United States.

**莫里斯牧師：**好，謝謝總統先生。我只是在想30年前，我在一家小教堂擔任副牧師，我請哈裡·傑克遜主教來教授我們的種族關係題目，教我們不太懂的事情。因為我們都不會知道我們還缺乏什麽知識。現在30年後，哈裡主教和我坐在美國總統的兩邊。

He was concerned about healing a problem that we’ve had in our nation for a long time, but not just addressing one part of the problem, but secretary of housing, education, justice here, Attorney Gerald Barr, thank you for being here. Thank you, our great governor, Governor Abbott, and I believe that we’re going to work together, and we’re going to see freedom, and justice for all in America. Thank you Mr. President.

他很擔心一個他一直聽到、而且存在於我們國家很長時間的一個問題，但不僅僅是解決問題的一部分，而是包括住房 （我們住房城建部長在場），教育，司法部長-吉羅德·巴爾， 非常感謝你們的到場。謝謝我們偉大的州長雅培（Abbott）州長，我相信我們將共同努力，我們將會看到自由與正義在美利堅榮光。謝謝總統先生。

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Great job you do here too, great job. Jeff, go ahead please.
**總統：**非常感謝，謝謝。非常感謝你。你的工作做得很棒，太棒了。傑克，請繼續。

Jack Brewer: Thank you Mr. President. Thank you, Pastor Morris, for offering your church. I think right now, like any other time in our nation’s history we need God. I’m praying to the Holy Spirit to put words in my mouth right now, and I want a nation to hear me. We need the fear of God. Mr. President, you’re the only Republican I’ve ever voted for, and I don’t just say that to make you feel good. Honestly, that’s not my goal, man. I’m saying that because you stood up for the word of God, and as believers, as the church, we have to pray for our president and have his back. When you raised that Bible up after those folks burnt that church, we are in a spiritual warfare.

Donald Trump:

Yes, you’re right.

**傑克·布魯爾:**謝謝總統先生。謝謝莫里斯牧師為大家提供教會。我認為現在，就像我們國家歷史上的其他任何時候一樣，我們需要上帝。（熱烈鼓掌!）我正在向聖靈祈禱，希望聖靈引導我說出智慧的語言，我希望我們的國度都能聽到我的聲音。我們需要敬畏上帝。總統先生，您是我投過選票的唯一共和黨人，我不只是為了讓您高興才說的。真的，那不是我的目的。我的意思是，因為您捍衛上帝的聖言，作為信徒、作為教會，我們必須為我們的總統祈禱並作為他的後盾。當您在那些人燒毀教堂之後高舉那本聖經時，我們就在屬靈爭戰中。（掌聲）

你說得對。

We cannot fight this battle with flesh and blood. We cannot fight this battle with politics. You cannot politicize oppression. I grew up right down the street. I looked at skinheads in the eye at 13 years old. My black father went to a KKK rally to protect me. I know what racism is, so when I hear words get thrown out about white supremacy, it eats me up, because these men aren’t white supremacists, that’s not what they look like. I’m telling black kids across America right now, we always hear, we don’t have black leaders. Look at this table. We are not as divided as our politics suggest, we are not as divided as our politics suggest, but I tell you what, this president, when I walk into my prisons, I’m blessed. I teach in prisons across our nation.

我們不能憑藉血氣來參加這戰鬥。我們不能用玩政治技倆來參加這戰鬥。你們不能將壓制政治化。我從街巷上長大。我13歲與光頭黨對目相視。我的黑人父親跑到KKK集會地來保護我。我知道種族主義是什麼，（最近）當我聽到有人說這是白人至高無上論時，這讓我痛苦不堪，因為這些人不是白人至上主義者，這可不是他們的模樣。我現在告訴整個美國的黑人孩子 – 我們經常聽到（所謂的）我們沒有黑人領袖：看這些在座的（非裔領袖們）！我們並沒有像政治所提示的那麼分裂， 我們就是沒有像政治所提示的那麼分裂！ 但是我告訴大家，這位總統，當我走進監獄時，我覺得我很幸運。我在全國各地的監獄中任教。

Men who are broken, the most broken men in our country. Our Bible teaches us to serve those in prison, our Bible teaches us to serve the poor, and when I walk into my class, and I say, “Guys, raise your hand if you’ve gotten sentence reduced from the First Step Act.” And, every single one of them raise their hand. That’s because of you Mr. President, and that’s because of policy, but you’re brave enough to go against what everyone else has said about you. Now, I’m calling on you to do more. We have a real issue in our country, in the root of it. Let’s not get our eye off the enemy. The root of it is fatherlessness. Our kids don’t have fathers, Attorney, A. G. Barr, you said it earlier. You talked about pulling God out.

那些心靈破碎的人，我們國家中最破碎的人。我們的聖經教導我們為在獄中的人們服務，我們的聖經教我們為窮人服務，當我走進班級時，我說：“夥計們，如果你的刑期因“第一步”法案被減刑，請舉手“，每個人都舉起手。那是因為您，總統先生，是因為您制定的政策。但是你有足夠的勇氣抵禦著其他人對你的非難。現在，我呼籲您做更多的事情。我們國家有一個真正的問題，從根上說 – 我們不要把我們的目光從敵人身上移開 – 其根源是無父，我們的孩子們沒有父親（在家）。司法部長A. G. Barr，您剛才說過，談到要借用上帝的力量。

Do we talk about education? Well 71% of those kids that drop out of high school don’t have a father in the house. We talk about criminal justice reform. You’re five times more likely to go to prison or have a run in with the police department if you don’t have a father in the house. We talk about healthcare. You’re four times more likely to live in poverty if you don’t have a father in the house, which means you’re going to be sicker. We don’t have to keep looking for the problem when we see it. Now it’s time for Americans of all color, I’m calling on my white brothers and sisters, I’m calling on my Spanish brothers and sisters, get out of your bubbles, go into the communities that are underserved, and let’s do what Jesus told us to do.

我們是指教育嗎？那些高中輟學的孩子中，有71％的家庭沒有父親。我們談論刑事司法改革。如果家中沒有父親，那麼這人入獄或與警察局有磕碰的可能性高出五倍。我們談論醫療保健。如果沒有父親在家，那麼你生活在貧困中的可能性將增加四倍，這意味著你將會病得更嚴重 。看到問題後，我們不必繼續尋找問題。現在是各族裔的美國人行動的時候了，我在呼籲我的白人兄弟姐妹，我在呼籲我的西班牙語系的兄弟姐妹，從你的小圈子裡跳出來，進入服務匱乏社區，讓我們做耶穌所指引我們要做的事。（掌聲）

We can bridge this gap of fatherlessnes. All we got to do is go out of our bubbles, go bridge the gap with these kids, teach them what you teach your kids. We all have rooms in our homes for a couple of little boys to come in, and play with our sons and daughters. Let’s bridge the gap through love, through Christ, and through being what we all know we are, and that’s one America, God bless America.

我們可以彌合這種無父之輩的鴻溝。我們要做的就是擺脫小圈子，與這些孩子彌合，像教育自己孩子一樣教他們。我們的家中都能有房間邀請幾個小男孩進來與我們的兒女們一起玩。讓我們通過愛，通過做我們大家已經知道本應做的事，來彌合鴻溝，那就是“一個美國”，上帝保佑美國。

Donald Trump: Thank you very much. [inaudible 01:10:04]. Anybody like to speak, please? Anybody? Who goes after that? [crosstalk 01:10:18]
**川普總統：** 非常感謝你。 （掌聲，站立致敬）有人想發言嗎？在此（重磅演講）之後還有誰來接著發言？

Will Douglas: Mr. President I’d like to speak. My name is Will Douglas. Thank you. I’m the owner of Crimson Care Pharmacy Group here in Dallas, Texas, and I’m also a Republican nominee for state representative here in Texas. First of all, I just want to thank your administration as well as Congress for getting the PPP loans. I’m speaking on behalf of my pharmacies, as well as a dozen or so other pharmacies here in the state of Texas that benefited from those, because of the PPP loans, I was able to not have to let any of my employees go, and in fact, I was able to hire additional employees, because our business model had changed overnight, no longer could customers come into our store. They were having to go through the drive through, which created a whole litany of other issues, so for that, thank you.

**道格拉斯：**總統先生，我想發言。我叫威爾·道格拉斯。（謝謝）。我是德克薩斯州達拉斯市Crimson Care Pharmacy Group的業主，也是德克薩斯州共和黨眾議員候選人提名。首先，我只想感謝您的政府以及國會獲得PPP貸款。我代表我的藥房以及德克薩斯州的十幾家受益於這些藥房的其他藥房，由於PPP貸款，我不必辭掉任何員工，實際上，我之所以能夠雇用更多的員工，是因為我們的商業模式在一夜之間發生了變化。很快顧客想來我們店時，他們再不用被迫只能選“車駕窗口服務“了- 那樣已經造成了一系列問題，為此，謝謝您。

The reason why I’m running for office is because to me, capitalism is the most important thing. Capitalism has created this bastion of free market enterprise that we have here in Texas with Dallas being the crown jewel, and I’m afraid that we’re going to lose that system that lifts people out of poverty. I was on a call with leaders in the black community here in Dallas the other day. One of them said something to me that did stuck out, and I can’t let it go, and that’s that, I think he said it was an African proverb, but that a child that is not embraced by the village will burn that village down…

我競選公職的原因是對我來說，資本主義是最重要的。資本主義建立了我們在德克薩斯州擁有的自由市場企業堡壘，達拉斯是的德州的皇冠明珠。但是我擔心會失去使人們擺脫貧困的體制。前幾天我在達拉斯與黑人社區的領導人通話。他們中的一個對我說的話叫我深有感觸，叫我念念不忘，那就是我想他說是個非洲諺語，

… embraced by the village, will burn that village down just to feel its warmth. As Republicans, we have to find ways to make capitalism embrace the people that it’s left behind. Because if we don’t, the next time it won’t just be villages and businesses that are being burned down. It will be the system that has lifted so many people out of poverty.

一個不被村莊擁抱的孩子終將會燒掉那個村莊，就為了感受一下它的溫暖。作為共和黨人，我們必須尋找途徑使資本主義擁抱被遺忘忽視的人民。因為如果我們不這樣做，下一次被燒毀將不僅僅是村莊和企業，那將是我們這個可以救助人們擺脫貧困的制度。（掌聲）

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

**總統：**謝謝。

Julian: So Mr. President I’ll be short. I just was going to say that thank you so much for your leadership. And I think the infrastructure that you presented today is going to help a lot of people. It’s going to touch businesses like William. It’s going to keep community safe with the partnership of these law enforcement officials and a partnership with these ministers that we have and advocates like John Ponder and Jack Brewer.

**朱利安·史密斯：**總統先生，我會很簡短的。我只是想說，非常感謝您的領導。我認為您今天介紹的基礎架構將幫助很多人。這將影響“威廉”這樣的企業。與執法人員的合作，以及與當地領袖的合作（包括倡導者Ponder, Brewer）,將會保護社區安全。

And so over the next couple of weeks, I think the American people look forward to seeing the wealth of executive orders that you are going to issue on justice and on economic empowerment. As well as legislative asks that we’re going to make to the Hill. But we all need your help, every locality, every group or organization. Because it’s really about bringing us all together. And that’s the secret ingredient. And it has to start at the local level. It starts at the local level because you are closer to the people. And we want to create that infrastructure and give you the tools to help you do what you do best. And that’s how people prosper. So thanks again, Mr. President.

因此，在接下來的幾周內，我認為美國人民期待看到您將要發佈的許多行政命令，涉及司法，經濟授權以及我們向國會山提出的立法方面的要求。但是我們需要您的説明 – 每個地區，每個組織或機構 – 因為我們要將所有這些凝聚在一起。 那是配方的秘密成分。 它必須從當地開始。 它始於當地層面，因為與人們距離近。 （掌聲）我們希望創建基礎架構，以此來為人們提供工具做最擅長的事，從而幫助人們繁榮昌盛。因此，非常感謝您！

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you Juilan. Thank you very much. Thank you Julian.

**總統：**謝謝朱利安。非常感謝你。 （掌聲）謝謝朱利安。

Frederic Frazier：  Mr. President, I’d like to say thank you for putting this together, putting this together in our state of Texas. Right here in Dallas a lot has happened in the last week. I’m one of your officers here in Dallas. I’m also one of your commissioners on your law enforcement administration with Attorney General Barr. And I can’t thank you enough [inaudible 01:14:08].

**弗雷澤：**總統先生，我想感謝您將這些匯總到一起，並將這一切匯總到我們的德克薩斯州，在達拉斯。上周發生了很多事情。我是您在達拉斯的警官之一。我也是您與司法部長巴爾一起執行執法事務的專員之一。我不勝感激（鼓掌）

I also have to say thank you to our great governor and our leadership that’s sitting right there without them. They don’t make the state, they don’t make the state great. We’ve had some challenges because of what’s happened with COVID. But I want to give you an update of what we’ve done on the commission so far. Where we’ve had nine full hearings throughout this entire time, that’s 35 panels, 125 witnesses, 190 written statements from individuals and interest groups. Our civil rights and community engagement organizations that we’ve asked to attend have no showed. And those are the ones who could make the biggest difference when you’re putting together any type of reform. Because they need to be the voice to come tell us what we need.

我還要感謝我們偉大的州長和我們在那裡的領導層。沒有他們，我們不會把我們的州 – 我們不會把我們的州變得這麼好。 （掌聲。）由於COVID的一些問題，我們遇到了一些挑戰。但是，我想向您介紹到目前為止我們在委員會上所做的工作。在整個過程中，我們已經進行了9次完整的聽證會，共有35個小組，125位證人，190個個人和利益集團的書面陳述。我們要求參加的民權組織和社區參與組織卻並未出席。當進行任何類型的改革時，那些因素可能會發揮最大作用。因為他們的聲音才能告訴我們到底人民需要什麽。

Law enforcement today is not what it was yesterday. In my 25 years, we’ve watched it propel to where our training is what we need the most. And with this commission, you’re going to see so many reforms come out of it. It could not have come at a better time. We can’t take back what happened in Minnesota. Not one officer that saw that or federal officer that saw that said that was the right thing that happened. It was malice and we can condemn it. If I could have trade places with Mr. Floyd, I would. Because I would die for everyone in this room because that’s our job. And if I could trade places with any one of those officers were there, I would have done that too. Because I wouldn’t have let that happen.

今天的執法機關已不是原來的樣子。在我25年的時間裡，我們看到它推動了最需要的培訓。有了這個委員會，您將看到很多改革會以此而出，而且沒有比現在推出更完美之時。我們無法收回明尼蘇達州發生的一切。沒有任何一個警官或聯邦警察看到那些事的，會認為那是正確的事情。這是惡意的，我們對此強烈譴責。如果我可以和佛洛德先生有換位機會，那我會的。因為我會為這裡的所有人而死，因為那是我們的職責。如果我可以和那裡的任何一名警員有換位機會，我也會這樣做。因為我不會讓這種事情發生。

And I have to say this to the citizens that we serve and the citizens that are listening. We see you. We hear you. We are with you. And we’re going to make this better.

我必須對我們所服務的公民和正在聽的公民們說：我們見到你們了，我們聽到你們的聲音了，我們與你們同心同行，而且我們會把這些事做得更好。

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

**總統：**非常感謝你。非常感謝你。

John Ponder: Mr. President I just want to thank you for your leadership. Echo the sentiments of some of my colleagues up here today. Thank you for your stance on criminal justice reform. Thank you for not forgetting about the forgotten people. Thank you for your commitment and your support to the men and women of law enforcement in this country and it is so so very important. My name is John Ponder I’m the CEO of a ministry called Hope for Prisoners. And what Hope for Prisoners does is we work with men, women, and young adults that are exiting different arenas of our judicial system. To provide the supportive services, to help them to be able to successfully reintegrate back into their home, back into the workplace and ultimately back into the community.

**約翰·龐德：**總統先生，我真心感謝您的領導。這也是呼應我在場的同仁們的感受。感謝您對刑事司法改革的立場。謝謝您不忘記那些被遺忘的人們。感謝您對這個國家執法人員的承諾和支持，這一點非常，非常重要。我叫約翰·龐德，我是一個名為“囚犯的希望”機構的首席執行官。“囚犯的希望”所做的，就是我們與已離開各種司法系統管制的人員以及青少年一起工作，給他們提供支援，幫助他們能夠成功地重新融入自己的家庭、工作場所，並最終融入社區。

And Mr. President, thank you for coming out and attending the graduation ceremony for those 31 men and women who were released from prison. I cannot tell you the wind that was beneath their wings because you came and spoke life into them. And they’re on the whole new dist of life right now because of that.

總統先生，感謝您參加監獄中釋放的這31名男女人員的畢業典禮。可以說您就是他們翅膀下面的支持他們的風，因為您的到來有喚醒了他們的生機。他們因此而處於生活的全新境界。（掌聲）

THE PRESIDENT: Great.

總統：太棒了，很好！

John Ponder: One of the huge components, this is why I’m so supportive of your stance of law enforcement, because one of the key components to this re-entry mechanism that we built up is our partnership with the police. Our local Sheriff of Las Vegas Nevada has given us close to 100 volunteer police offices that are mentoring and training men and women coming home from the prison system. And certain never before in the history of reentry, nowhere on this planet to this magnitude had the men and women from law enforcement come alongside formerly incarcerated folks and help them to successfully reintegrate back into the community. That is just further evidence that we serve a gigantic God that wants to bridge the gap.

**約翰·龐德:**其中一個重要組成部分，這也是為什麼我如此支持您的執法立場，因為我們建立的這種重返機制的關鍵組成部分之一就是我們與警局的夥伴關係。我們內華達州拉斯維加斯的治安官為我們提供了將近100個志願警察局，以輔導和培訓從監獄系統釋放回家的男女。歷史上從未有過這樣的重返機制，在這個星球上，從未有如此眾多的執法人員與前被監禁的人並肩努力，幫助他們成功地重新融入社區。這是進一步的證據，表明我們服務於一個希望彌合鴻溝的至高無上的上帝。

Why that is so important because what God wants to do, the Bible calls it the repairer of the breach. See in communities across our country, there’s such a disconnect between law enforcement and people from this segment of the population. But when we’re able to come up with very creative ways to bring folks together, because you think about it, all across the country, that in that disconnect, people do not trust police.

為什麼這是如此重要，因為這是上帝想做的事，聖經稱其為“漏洞的修復者”。在我們全國各地的社區中，執法人員與來自這一部分人群的人們之間存在著如此的脫節。但是，當我們能夠提出非常有創意的方式將人們召集在一起時，你想想，因為全國各地都因為這脫節，人們不信任員警。

Do you know why? Because they’re not in relationship with them. And in what relationship could you ever have trust unless there’s life rubbing up against life in the spirit of complete transparency? That we have more in common than we have differences. And out of that transparency build a relationship and out of that relationship, it gets established trust.
你知道為什麼嗎？因為他們與他們沒有建立關係。怎末才會有值得信任的關係呢？除非生活上相互摩擦，精神上的完全透明？ 我們的共同點遠勝於分歧。出於這種透明度，我們建立了一種關係，而出於這種關係，它就建立了信任。

It is something that second chance employers have absolutely fallen in love with. When you can tell the employer that the person that’s coming that just came home from prison, that the mentor is a captain of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, that begins to just open doors. So I thank you for that. Looking so very forward to the direction that we’re going. And on behalf of the men and women who are incarcerated right now and our prison system across the country, thank you for creating that atmosphere for them on the inside. But I know that you have dug the trenches to create an atmosphere for them once they get released. So I thank you for that.
這是“第二次機會“雇主們絕對欣賞的。 就可以看得出 – 當你可以告訴雇主即將來臨的那個人剛從監獄回到家時，這位輔導員就是拉斯維加斯大都會警察局的隊長，雇主會敞開大門。 因此，我對此表示感謝。 我們非常期待我們的發展方向。 我代表現在在全國監獄系統被監禁的人員，感謝您為他們在監禁期內就營造了這種氛圍。 但是我知道，您已經為他們挖通溝渠，為他們釋放後營造好的氛圍。 因此，我對此表示感謝。

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you John very nice. Thank you very much. Very nice. Great job you’re doing John. Great job. Please.

**總統：**謝謝約翰，很好。 非常感謝你。 非常好。 約翰，你做得很好。 做得好。 請。

Dr. Robin Armstrong:  Thank you, Mr. President, for putting this together today. I’ve learned so much from these men and women on this stage. I really appreciate that. Thank you for, my name’s Dr.Robin Armstrong and I’m a physician. And I’ve had an opportunity to treat many, many patients with the plague from China, and with the COVID-19. And so we’ve had a lot of opportunity. Thank you so much for breaking down some of the regulatory barriers in the FDA to allow us to use medications like hydroxychloroquine.

**羅賓·阿姆斯特朗醫生:**總統先生，謝謝你今天把大家召集在一起討論。我從每個在座的人那裡學到了很多東西。我真的很感激。謝謝你，我叫羅賓·阿姆斯特朗（Robin Armstrong），是一名醫生。我有機會治療了多名染“中國瘟疫”患者，即COVID-19感染者 。真的是有很多。非常感謝您打破了FDA的一些監管壁壘，使我們能夠使用羥氯喹等藥物。

And to use medications like remdesivir , and plasma infusions, and all those medications are coming online now. Thank you so much for that. I have the opportunity to, we had a nursing home in South Texas that had an outbreak of, of COVID-19. And we saw a lot of nursing facilities around the country that were having horrible outcomes and many deaths. And what we decided to do was commit to this facility and use a medication that you are familiar with, hydroxychloroquine. And we saw tremendous outcomes. And it was… With the help of some of our elected officials, our Lieutenant Governor, and the State Senator, we were able to get access to those medications. But one of the more frustrating things I’ve seen has been the resistance of some of the regulatory agencies to be more open to using that. I certainly know that COVID-19 has significantly adversely affected the African American community. And I really believe that had there been more of an openness by the regulatory agencies, certainly by our medical boards all around the country to use medications like hydroxychloroquine, I believe more lives could have been saved.

並使用瑞德西韋（remdesivir ）這樣的藥物和血清注射治療，所有這些均將上線提供。對此感激不盡。得克薩斯州南部的一家養老院中爆發了COVID-19，我有機會去了那裡（治療病人）。之前，我們看到全國各地的許多養老機構發生的可怕情形和造成的諸多死亡。而我們決心盡全力救治這家養老院並使用您熟悉的藥物羥氯喹。我們看到了巨大的成效。確實……在一些我們的民選官員，副州長和州參議員的幫助下，我們得以獲得這些藥物。但是，我也看到了些更令人沮喪的事情，其中​​之一就是某些監管機構抵制更加放開地使用這些藥物。我當然知道，COVID-19對非裔美國人社區產生了重大不利影響。我也確信，如果監管機構，當然還有我們全國各地的醫療委員會對使用羥氯喹等藥物採取更開放的態度，我相信更多的生命可以被挽救。

And so I really, I want to thank you for bringing that issue to the forefront. Because I believe that it did give us more access to medications. And so it was helpful for us, I believe it’s saved lives. I believe we could have saved more lives. But I just want to thank you for the work has been done. Regulations, and you’ve really broke down a lot of barriers and regulations. And in the business community, certainly I would appreciate what you’ve done on attempting to repeal Obamacare and all the efforts you’ve made towards that. That’s certainly going to improve access to care.

因此，我真的很感謝您將這個問題放在首位。因為我相信這確實為我們提供了更多使用藥物的途徑。這對我們很有幫助，我相信此舉已挽救了生命。我也相信我們本可以挽救更多的生命。此時我只想感謝您所做的工作。法規，您確實打破了許多障礙和法規。在業界，我也感激您為廢除奧巴馬醫改（Obamacare）所做的一切以及您為此付出的所有努力。這肯定會改善獲取醫療的機會。

And so I just want to thank you for all you’ve done. But we need to do a lot of work going forward to make sure that we minister to those who are most vulnerable. And so we really appreciate that. Thank you for all the work that Secretary Carson has done, and Secretary Azar has done, and our Surgeon General here has done. Thank you for allowing them to have the freedom to be able to innovate, and do things, and look at the data, and make decisions. And so we really appreciate that. And thank you so much. And physicians are very supportive of you. We’re really supportive of everything you’ve done to help bring this very inexpensive treatment to the forefront. And so thank you very much.

因此，我只想感謝您所做的一切。但是，我們還需要做很多工作，以確保我們為最弱勢群體提供服務。因此，我們非常感謝。感謝你們，卡森部長（Secretary Carson），阿扎爾部長（Secretary Azar）以及我們此時在座的衛生局局長，感謝你們所做的一切。感謝您允許他們自由地進行創新、行動、查看數據和製定決策。因此，我們非常感激。非常感謝你。醫生們非常支持您。我們非常支持您所做的一切工作，感謝您將這種非常便宜的治療方法帶到最前沿。因此，非常感謝。

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much dr. Appreciate it. Thank you. Please

川普總統: 非常感謝您，醫生先生。謝謝。請

Chief Dooley: Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity. I’m humbled to be here. I’m Chief Dooley, Glenn Heights Police department. My experience is based on serving in a large department and a small department. And I can tell you that there is some phenomenal police work being done out here, across the board, across the board.

杜利局長: 總統先生，謝謝您給的這次機會。我很榮幸來到這裡。我是Glenn Heights的警察局局長Dooley。基於我在職服務於大大小小各部門的親身經歷，我可以告訴您，這裡警察的工作令人讚嘆，方方面面都不錯

But there’s also some inconsistencies in our procedures, our policies, our hiring practices, our termination practices, our disciplinary practices. And I strongly support the need for standardization based on best practices for all police departments in our country. I thank the President for his foresight for making these things come to happen. I know they’re coming and we need it. We are a country of very good departments, but we need to be a country of great departments. And this message today is about the transition to greatness. We have an opportunity in this country to transform the future of law enforcement. But we need to make sure that we have a relentless pursuit of dedication to public service at all times and at all levels.

然而，我們在程序、政策制定、招聘解僱，和紀律規範上也存在一些不足之處。我堅決支持有必要對我國所有警察部門根據最優實踐經驗進行規範統一。我感謝總統的遠見卓識，使實現這些指日可待。我知道變革即將開始，這正是我們需要的。我們是一個擁有如此優秀部門的國家，但我們更需要成為一個擁有眾多傑出部門的國家。今天傳達的是關於走向偉大的信息。我們在這個國家有機會改變執法的未來。但是，我們需要確保我們始終不懈對公共服務的奉獻精神。

Specifically national consistence policy on use of force, every chief would be in support of that. Mandatory participation and national use of force database, yes, it needs to happen. Development of national statements for discipline and termination of police officers, that needs to happen. Development of a public, a police officer decertification database. Yes, we need to be able to get those bad apples out of our industry. So what happened will never happen again.

特別是關於使用武力的國家統一政策，每位警察長都將對此予以支持。強制參與和全國共享使用警員數據庫，是的，這需要去創建。需要製定國家級紀律處分和解僱警官的公告系統。開發一個公共的，警察資格取消認證的數據庫。是的，我們需要能夠將那些害群之馬從我們的行業中淘汰出來。因此，將永遠不會再出現這些天來發生的事。

We need to enhance the police leadership and the culture, and it starts at the top. We have some great leaders in this country, but we can always be better. We can always continuously improve. We need to implement improved recruitment, hiring, and promotion practices that are dedicated to having officers that are relentlessly pursuing the service of not the community, but our community. It’s about no, not dividing us, but uniting us and understand that we come from the community.

我們需要增強警察的領導能力和文化培養，這要從最高領導層面做起。在這個國家，我們有一些偉大的領頭人，但我們可以變得更好。我們可以不斷提高。我們需要改進招聘、僱用和晉升制度，以敦促警員們努力不懈服務社區，我們的社區。不要分裂我們警民，而要團結大家在一起，要知道我們同樣也來自於各個社區。

We need to enhance the ability for police agencies to implement effective discipline. We need to make sure that we have policies that establish a framework for a community policemen engagement, that fully embraces that police officers serve, protect and connect everyone in our community so that we all can become better.

我們需要增強警察機構實施有效紀律的能力。我們需要從政策上確保構建警員參與社區框架，充分保證警員們能服務、保護和聯繫社區的每個人，以使我們共同變得更好。

We need training. This is not the time to defund police departments. When an organization or a business is struggling to be better now is not the time to take away those resources. You provide them, and you hold them accountable, and you set expectations and you manage them so they can be better. That’s what you do. We need more training. We need more specific training that’s dedicated to service of those that everyone we enact with on a daily basis. Those that are homeless, those that suffer from mental illness, those that need food. Okay? We need the training to be able to connect those people we interact with, with those that can provide those services. That’s what we need in this country. I want to end with just these few thoughts. I have a very simple saying to my officers that we serve protect and connect, and together is better. And as I look around this room, I know that together we will become better and we will take this country to great levels under the leadership of Donald Trump.

我們需要培訓。現在不是給警察部門削減資金的時候。當一個組織或行業正在努力變得更好時，現在不是剝奪這些資源的時候。您應當保證供給、明確責任、設定期望並進行管理，以促其變得更好。這才是要做的。我們需要更多的培訓。我們需要更具體的、以與我們警員有日常接觸的人作為服務對象的針對性培訓。那些無家可歸的人，那些患有精神疾病的人，那些需要食物的人。好嗎？我們需要培訓，以便更好互動聯繫需要服務的（民眾）和提供服務的（警員們）。這就是現在我們這個國家需要的。最後，我想談談一些想法。我對我的警員們說的很簡單，就是我們所提供的是保護和連接，所以（警民）在一起會更好。當我環顧這個房間時，我知道我們在一起將會變得更好，在唐納德·川普的領導下，我們將把這個國家帶到一個新的高度。

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you，appreciated, thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, that’s beautiful. So it’s time to say goodbye. But we’ll be back, we’ll be back. And I just want to thank Bishop. You’ve been my friend for a long time, and I appreciate everything you’ve done and everything you’ve said. A great unifying source of strength and everything else and I appreciate it very much.

Bishop Jackson: Thank you. Can I add one last thing?

**川普總統**：謝謝, 感謝。謝謝，謝謝，非常感謝，說得太好了。該說再見了，但是我們會回來的。我們會回來的。我想感謝主教。您是我們長久以來的朋友，我很感謝您所做的一切和您所說的一切，這是力量和其他一切的偉大集結源泉，我對此非常感激。

**傑克遜主教**：謝謝。我可以講最後一件事嗎？

THE PRESIDENT: Please.

Bishop Jackson: Before you leave?

Donald Trump: Please.

**川普總統**: 請。

**傑克遜主教**: 在您離開之前

**川普總統**: 請。

Bishop Jackson: I’m tired of people blaming the current administration and others in our generation. These problems began many years ago. And what has been exciting to me is, was a church that began the abolitionist movement. It was the church and whites and blacks working together that started the NAACP. It didn’t have a black leader at the beginning at the time. It was the church that led through in the civil rights movement.

傑克遜主教: 我已聽夠了人們指責現任政府和我們這一代人。這些問題始於多年前。但令我感到激動的是，廢奴運動開始於一個教堂。 NAACP的創立正是由教會和白人黑人一起共同努力完成的。當時開始時沒有黑人領袖，教會領導了民權運動。

So I want to offer you my support in these listening sessions, in that the church needs to come together.  I believe we can unify better than any group. And what we’re looking for you to do is to give structural guidance, which you’re working on, and you’ve — you’ve already brought forth some amazing things.  But I want to affirm that Democrats can’t kneel down and wear Kente cloth and stop black pain.

因此，在這些座談會中，我想向您表達支持。教會需要團結起來。我相信我們可以比任何團體更好地合一。而我們期望您能做的是提供建設性指導，您現在正是這麼做的，而且已經初見成效。但我想強調的是，民主黨人不能以下跪、穿戴肯特服飾（西非傳統服飾）來止息黑肤之痛。

Bishop Jackson: Republicans can’t take some one time act and stop that black pain. But I believe we’ve got a man here who’s courageous enough-

Bishop Jackson: … to begin something that’s tough.

Speaker 12: Yes.

Bishop Jackson: And that we’re going to this time heal. And so I weep over this. I pray for you as you know.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

**傑克遜主教**: 共和黨人也不可能只採取一次行動就能製止這種黑膚之痛。但我相信我們這裡有一個足夠勇敢的人-

**傑克遜主教**：……開始著手做這件艱難的事。

**發言人12**：是的。

**傑克遜主教**： 我們將在這個時代開始治愈。我為此而哭泣。如您所知，我為您祈禱。

**川普總統**： 謝謝。

Bishop Jackson: And we believe that we’re going to get it right. I’m going to say one last thing, I lost of my late wife a couple years ago. I found out in dealing with her that sometimes you just got to listen, feel her pain. If you try to fix it too early, you’re going to make a mistake. Sure listening sessions are wise, because it’s going to give that cathartic process a chance.

**傑克遜主教**： 我們相信我們將撥亂反正。我要說的最後一件事是關於幾年前我已過世的妻子。我發現在和她交流時，有時你只需要傾聽，感覺到她的痛苦。如果你過早嘗試修復，那往往是個錯誤。花時間去聆聽是明智的，因其提供了一個宣洩出口。

So I don’t want to take up too much time, sir. But I wanted to say that the people here, I challenge you. Christians, black, white, Asian, let’s come together and let’s provide a safety net. And then we’ll work with business and then we’ll work along with the administration. But don’t push them out here up front and say, “Fix it now, fix it now, fix it now, fix it now.” Because it’s never worked that way.

總統先生，我不想再佔時間多講了。但是我想對這裡的人說，我建議基督徒們，黑人、白人、和亞裔們，請聯合起來提供一個保護網。然後，我們將與各行各業、與行政部門一起合作。而不是將他們推至前台說：“現在改，現在改，現在改，現在改。”因為這樣事悖常理。

Donald Trump: That’s good.

Bishop Jackson: Thank you, sir.

Donald Trump: Thank you very much, Harry.  Appreciate it.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much, Pastor.  Fantastic job you do. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you.

**川普總統**： 說得很好。

**傑克遜主教**：謝謝你，總統先生。

川普總統： 非常感謝你，哈利。感激。非常感謝你。主教先生，非常感謝。你做的很棒。 謝謝大家。非常感謝你們。謝謝。
