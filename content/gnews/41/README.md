**路德**
Sellin 博士今天发推正式提到了舟山蝙蝠病毒骨架
Dr. Sellin tweeted today and officially mentioned about the Zhoushan bat virus backbone
我们之前做节目说过
As we said in a previous show
Sellin 博士前天发推说SIXTA
Dr. Sellin tweeted the day before yesterday mentioned about the SIXTA
那是二战时期最神秘的一个组织
It was one of the most mysterious organizations during World War II
专门破译和分析所有的
It was dedicated to decode and analyze
的秘密以及所有信息的无线电信号的
all the secrets radio signals of all information
当时德军和日军
of the German and Japanese troops at that time
现在美国以及盟国也有类似于这样的一个组织正在分析
Now, the United States and allies have a similar organization that
解密所有的病毒相关的机密
decode and analyze all virus-related secrets
他发推说这就是舟山蝙蝠病毒的骨架做的
He tweeded that this is Zhoushan bat virus backbone
这个对闫博士的报告最关键的进一步深入
This is the most critical further insight for Dr. Yan’s report
这就是（闫博士报告）里面写的ZC45舟山蝙蝠病毒
This is Zhoushan bat virus written in Dr. Yan’s report
我们在2020年1月19 日的时候，大家想想啊，
Think about this, we were on Jan 19, 2020 to say it
全世界只有中共说的62例（中共病毒感染者）时
There were only 62 cases (of the CCP virus infection) that CCP told the world
我们就说了大爆发
We have said it will be an outbreak pandemic
这几天布林肯号召美国
In recent a few days, Blinken has called on the U.S. to
一定要敢干
dare to do it (investigate the origin of the CCP virus)
先把防守做好，谨防第二波，第三波
To do a good defense first, then, guard against the second wave and the third wave
第二，一定要彻查，透明地彻查
Second, we must conduct a thorough and transparent investigation
这句话透明彻查，
The sentence of thorough and transparent investigation
大家有没有（想过）?
Have you ever (ever thought) ?
上次美国政府要透明彻查是什么时候？
when was the last time the US government wanted to conduct a transparent and thorough investigation?
伊拉克！萨达姆！要彻查
For Iraq！ Saddam！ U.S did a thorough investigation
过一段时间你听啊，一定是联合国
After a while you will see, it must be the United Nations
就像当年对萨达姆一样
It’s just like when we treated Saddam Hussein
联合国会通过一个决议，
The United Nations needs pass a resolution
美国都是按程序走，
the United States will go through a procedure
彻查病毒来源
to investigate the origin of the virus thoroughly
先理后兵，美国都这样，
The U.S used to tell you the reason, then they dispatch their troop
伊拉克，萨达姆这个也是一样
It’s the same with Iraq and Saddam Hussein
先给萨达姆说，我们的情报说，
Firstly, they tell Saddam that our intelligence says that
你这里有研制大规模伤性武器
you have developed weapons of mass destruction
我们要求彻查
We request a thorough investigation
联合国也通过决议彻查
The United Nations also passed a resolution to conduct a thorough investigation
然后给最后通牒三次
Then give an ultimatum three times
三次不干，小布什马上召开记者发布会。
After three quits, Bush Jr. immediately held a press conference
现通知萨达姆24小时之内离开，
Saddam was now notified to leave within 24 hours
让联会国去彻查，
so that the United Nations will conduct a thorough investigation
因为他们研制大规模杀伤性武器
because they developed weapons of mass destruction
你看看，商务部说
You see, the U.S. Department of Commerce said that
中共研究大规模杀伤性武器
the CCP researched weapons of mass destruction
你觉得我们说的还是危言耸听吗？
Do you think what we are talking about is still alarmist?
