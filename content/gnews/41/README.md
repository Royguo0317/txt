00:11-00:47

It is such a mess. In Beijing, many fellow fighters suddenly disappeared. Then I found out what happened: some of our fellow fighters’ phones lost connection. Some emergency happened in Beijing. Yesterday, many troops in disguise secretly entered Beijing from the south, west, southeast, northeast, north, and northwest [of Beijing]. From seven different directions, many troops in disguise entered Beijing. What happened? What was going on?

这真够乱的啊，这个北京啊咱们很多战友，突然间从昨天找不着了。后来我发现咋回事儿啊，咱们有些战友手机不能联系。北京出现了紧急情况。昨天，大批的军队秘密地乔装打扮进入北京，从南部、西部、东南角、东北角、北部、西北角，七个角七个部分（不确定是“七”否为口误还是战略）大量地军队乔装进入北京，发生啥事儿了？咋回事儿啊？

01:41-03:41

People from inside of China sent me a message, “Mr. Guo, could we show each other some grace? And about Lude, could you let him keep his mouth shut? We still have room [for negotiation]. We give each other some leeway.” It means that they are saving our face and we can still make peace with each other. However, I had no idea about what Lude had said. I immediately texted Lude, “What did you say, Lude? Tell me about it.” I said, “you are indeed making trouble for me, and I am cleaning it up for you.” I really didn’t know what he said. I really didn’t know. Of course, later I figured out from which channel Lude got the information. There was a fellow fighter that “betrayed” me and sent the information to Lude rather than me, which is outrageous.

这个国内今天有人给我发信息：“哎，郭先生，咱不能把事儿搞绝了啊。还有那个路波切，让他就别说啦、别说啦。我们还有空间啊，咱们都留着空间呐。” 意思还给我们留面子，还可以讲和啊。但是路德那边讲，我都不知道路德讲啥。后来我赶快发[信息]，我说：“路德，你讲啥啊，路德给我说一说。”我说：“你这真是，你惹麻烦七哥给你背锅。”我真不知道他讲啥，我真不知道。当然啦，后来我就知道路德是哪方面来的渠道啊。这个有战友“出卖”七哥，把这个情报给路德不给我，不像话。

Well, I will not talk more about the domestic finance in China. For the economy, I will tell you a simple figure. Our fellow fighter in the Bureau of Statistics told me, “Brother Seven, you probably won’t believe at all about I’m gonna tell you.” He said that in the past 4 months every sector of the economy has declined by 50%. Bad debts in banks have increased by 50%, and that is on the top of the previous 40%. Fellow fighters, now in China, the bad debts in banks account for 65 to 70%. It is said that if the real estate collapses, everything will be over, and if the real estate doesn’t collapse, everything will still be over just at a slower pace.

但是呢，国内的金融我就不多说了。经济，大家我就告诉大家最简单的一个数字。统计局的战友告诉我说，他说：七哥可能你根本…我跟你说你都不相信。他说：过去这四个月，任何一样[经济]往下跌幅都是拦腰斩。银行的烂账在过去的40[%]基础上又拦腰斩。战友们，现在大家现在国内的银行烂账65 – 70[%]左右。说房地产要倒，一切全完。房地产不倒，一切就是慢点完。

It is said that the Zhongnan Pit is in a mess: it ordered some data two hours ago, then after two hours it called to use some other data, and after another two hours, the big head (President Xi) would say, “The data are not good and need to be tweaked.” Everyone is at a loss. The rolling pin [fake economy] has been used so frequently that everyone is in panic and not even knowing how to use it anymore.

说现在整个中南坑乱得是一锅粥。说两小时以前下的命令要这个数据，两小时以后打电话要用这个数据，再过两小时说大脑袋说啦，这数据不行，得改这数据。大家无所适从，这擀面杖子老用啊，就用慌了，不知道咋用啦。

But the Whistleblower Movement doesn’t want the Chinese people to live in dire straits. The Whistleblower Movement is happy about this [situation] because the mess of the CCP is the opportunity for us.

但是爆料革命不需要中国人活在水生火热之中，但是爆料革命俺喜欢、俺高兴、俺愿意。共产党乱不就咱的机会嘛。

04:11-05:01

With the limited ability, the CCP doesn’t know that God’s will is indeed standing with the Whistleblower Movement. So many people suddenly got sick, and so many people were killed. Now it is really chaotic. I heard that Shanghai is now waiting for the right moment to take actions. Now, there are people who want to be the mantis…catching the cicada while the oriole is hiding from behind, but the oriole is not necessarily the winner. After I mentioned this yesterday, about the “mantis catching snake”, “mantis catching rat” and “mantis catching bird”, our fellow fighters were really awesome, they figured it all out. It is not a mantis trying to stop a chariot or a mantis trying to stop it using its arm. The mantis ought to eat the snake, then whose animal zodiac is snake? Whose animal zodiac is snake? Whose animal zodiac is rat? I asked you to look into it, but some of you didn’t get it.

共产党那点本事，它不知道天意啊真的站在爆料革命这边。这么多人突然有病啦，这么[多]人被弄死啦。现在真是乱啦。听说上海现在啊，蠢蠢欲动啊。现在有些人想当螳螂…捕蝉黄雀在后，黄雀不一定是赢家。我昨天我推荐以后，战友们螳螂捕蛇、螳螂捕老鼠、螳螂捕鸟。战友们就找到啦，战友你们真厉害。不是螳臂挡车，也不是“螳螂挡臂”。螳螂还得吃蛇，谁属蛇的呀？谁属蛇的呀？谁属鼠的呀？七哥让你们看，你们都没明白啥意思呀。
