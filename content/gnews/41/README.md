战友之家创始人 Sara 女士近日在社交媒体上强调在德州进行“惩贼”傅希秋的三个原因，并向在第一线的“惩贼”抗议的战友们致以敬意。

我们华人要完全抛开根深蒂固的多一事不如少一事的观念，我们站在德州米德兰的理由：

We of Chinese descent, really should eradicate the deep-rooted notion that “Don’t be bothered by other’s trouble so long as it has not affected myself for the time being”. The reasons that many of us have stepped forward in protesting Bob Fu in the city of Midland, TX are:

1、必须彻底调查 Bob Fu 傅希秋，不能让 CCP 特务祸害美国。

It is imperative for us to raise the U.S. government’s awareness in order to launch an immediate and full investigation on Bob Fu (aka, Xiqiu Fu or 傅希秋). We shall not allow any CCP spies to continue to harm the U.S.  anymore.

2、绝对不能黑白颠倒，必须让市长 [Patrick Payton] [1]来对话，（我们不会去市政府找他，我们不做上访户，那是 CCP 国家做的）。

Midland Mayor’s [1] inversions of right and wrong are absolutely unacceptable. We demand Mayor Patrick Payton to come out and have an open dialogue with us. And “No”, we will not attempt to look for him in the City Hall, as we are not the oppressed petitioners begging for a meet-up. That’d be a thing only belongs to the regime of the CCP.

3、如果居民有意见，我们真心对不起，但是我们是为了他们的明天不成为现在的中国。

In case our “Bring the CCP’s Spies to Justice” protests have caused any unintended inconvenience to the local residents, our sincere apologies.

However, with all due respect, we’d like to bring attention to all American people – we are protesting vigorously is because we really would not want America’s tomorrow to degenerate to Communist China’s Today.

咱们华人要从今天开始挺起腰杆

We of Chinese descent, from today onwards, let each of us grow a spine!

@支援德州 感恩所有的你们

Kudos to all the frontline protesters in Texas, our brothers-in-arms!  Thank you all very much!
