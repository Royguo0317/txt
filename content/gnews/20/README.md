## 8月25日美國國務卿蓬佩奧在共和黨全國大會上的發言（文字版全文）

I’m Mike Pompeo. I’m speaking to you from beautiful Jerusalem, looking out over the old city. I have a big job, as Susan’s husband and Nick’s dad. Susan and Nick are more safe and their freedoms more secure because President Trump has put his America First vision into action. It may not have made him popular in every foreign capital, but it’s worked. President Trump understands what my great fellow Kansan President Eisenhower said, “For all that we cherish and justly desire for ourselves or for our children, the securing of peace is the first requisite.”

我是麥克·蓬佩奧。我正在美麗的耶路撒冷，眺望著這個古老的城市，向大家講話。我作為蘇珊的丈夫和尼克的老爸，擔負一項重要工作。因為川普總統將他的“美國最重要”理念付諸行動，蘇珊和尼克現在更加安全，他們的自由得到了更大保障。這個理念可能讓他在有些外國首府成為不受歡迎的人，但它很有用。川普總統深知偉大的、我的堪薩斯同胞艾森豪威爾總統說過的話：“為了我們自己和我們的孩子所珍惜和渴望的一切，確保和平是首要條件。”

Indeed, the primary constitutional function of the national government is ensuring that your family and mine are safe and enjoy the freedom to live, to work, to learn, and to worship as they choose. Delivering on this duty to keep us safe and our freedoms intact, this president has led bold initiatives in nearly every corner of the world.

確實，憲法規定的政府基本職能是確保你、我的家人生命安全，享有自由的生活、工作、學習，以及可以自己決定信仰。總統在世界幾乎每個角落都採取了大膽舉措，踐行了這份保護我們安全和自由的職責。

In China, he’s pulled back the curtain on the predatory aggression of the Chinese Communist Party. The president has held China accountable for covering up the China virus and allowing it to spread death and economic destruction in America and around the world, and he will not rest until justice is done. He has ensured that the Chinese Community Party’s spies posing as diplomats in America are jailed or sent back to China and he has ended the ridiculously unfair trade arrangement with China that punched a hole in our economy. Those jobs, those jobs are coming back home.

對中共國，他掀開了中共掠奪式侵略行為的遮掩布。總統要求中共國對掩蓋中共病毒真相，並任由病毒將死亡和經濟破壞蔓延到美國和世界負責，正義不匡扶，行動不停止。他保證把中共以外交名義作為偽裝來美國的間諜送到監獄或送回中國，他還終止了與中共國簽訂的、使我們的經濟陷入困境的、可笑的不平等貿易協議。那些工作崗位都回來了。

In North Korea, the president lowered the temperature and against all odds got the North Korean leadership to the table. No nuclear tests, no long range missile tests, and Americans held captive in North Korea came home to their families, as did the precious remains of scores of heroes who fought in Korea. Today, today because of President Trump, NATO is stronger, Ukraine has defensive weapon systems, and America left a harmful treaty so our nation can now build missiles to deter Russian aggression.

對朝鮮，總統讓局勢降溫並克服一切困難讓朝鮮領導人回到談判桌上。不進行核試驗，不進行遠程導彈試驗，被朝鮮關押的美國人回來與家人團聚，朝鮮戰爭烈士的珍貴遺體也回到了故鄉。今天，因為有川普總統，北約變得更強大，烏克蘭擁有了防禦武器系統，美國也退出了一項有害條約，現在我們國家可以製造導彈來震懾俄羅斯的盛氣凌人。

In the Middle East, when Iran threatened, the president approved a strike that killed the Iranian terrorist Qasem Soleimani. This is the man most responsible for the murder and maiming of hundreds of American soldiers and thousands of Christians across the Middle East, and you’ ll recall too, that when the president took office, radical Islamic terrorists had beheaded Americans and ISIS controlled a territory the size of Great Britain. Today, today because of the president’s determination and leadership, the ISIS caliphate is wiped out, it’s gone. It’s evil leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is dead and our brave soldiers, they’re on their way home.

對中東，當伊朗造成威脅時，總統批准一項打擊行動，擊斃伊朗恐怖分子卡西姆·蘇萊曼尼。此人是中東地區數百名美國士兵和幾千名基督徒被殺害和致殘的罪魁禍首。你應該還記得，總統上任時，激進的伊斯蘭恐怖分子斬首了美國人，ISIS控制了相當於英國領土面積的一片地區。今天，由於總統的決心和領導力，伊斯蘭國哈里發被清除，結束了。它邪惡的首領阿布·巴克爾·巴格達迪已斃命。而我們勇敢的軍人正在回家的路上。

The president exited the US from the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran and squeezed the Ayatollah, Hezbollah, and Hamas. The president too moved the US embassy to this very city of God, Jerusalem, the rightful capital of the Jewish homeland, and just two weeks ago, the president brokered a historic peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. This is a deal that our grandchildren will read about in their history books.

總統退出了與伊朗簽訂的災難性核協議，並且箝制了霍姆尼、真主黨和哈馬斯。總統還把美國大使館遷至耶路撒冷這座上帝之城，這是猶太人的國家合法的首都。就在兩週前，總統促成以色列和阿聯酋簽訂歷史性和平協議，這項協議將載入子孫輩的歷史教科書中。

You know, as a soldier, I saw firsthand people desperate to flee to freedom, the way of each of us can best ensure our freedoms is by electing leaders who don’t just talk, but who deliver. An American hostage, imprisoned in Turkey for two years, Pastor Andrew Brunson, said upon his release that he survived his ordeal with these words of scripture, “Be faithful, endure, and finish well.” If we stay the course, we will. May God ritually bless you and may God bless our great nation, the United States of America.

大家知道，作為一名軍人，我親眼看到很多人渴望逃向自由。我們每個人能夠確保自由的最好方式就是選出一位言必信、行必果的領導者。安德魯·布倫森牧師作為美國人質在土耳其被關押兩年，他在被釋放時曾說，他之所以經受住了這次考驗，是因為《聖經》中的這些話：信念，忍耐，善終。如果我們堅持不懈，一定會。願上帝保佑大家，願上帝保佑我們偉大的美利堅合眾國！
