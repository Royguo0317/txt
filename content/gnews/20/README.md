英文標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep 209: Chinese Communist Party attributed the food crisis to food waste

重點內容

1. 8月20日，四川樂山五通橋永祥化工廠發生氣體洩漏事件，全城居民大逃亡，當日，官方否認有氣體洩漏，轉天又稱有少量氯化氫氣霧散發。大量民眾批評當局隱瞞實情。
2. 8月20日重慶百年不遇洪災，整個城市泡在水中。一棟樓的房子現在只露了一個房頂出現。重慶近期滴雨未下，長江流域有近5萬座水庫。
3. 中國即將面臨糧食危機，中共開始警告人民不要浪費糧食；浪費糧食已經被定義為犯罪。生活在中共國沒有人權，沒有法制，沒有言論自由。
4. （比爾·格茨，8/19）（從蔡霞被開除中共黨籍談起）我想中共黨內有聲音傳遞出，他們開始認識到中共是個黑社會國家政權，這些腐敗的家族盜走了中國人民的財富。很明显过去八年来，习近平残酷地集中权力，造成了党内和中国人民广泛地反对他的统治。中国人民痛恨中共，视中共为腐败政治實體。
5. (郭文貴先生，8/20）班農先生的事，发生后不到20分鐘，我就得知共產黨的媒體，CCTV，所有的（中共）媒體， 就报道出来了。再過20分鐘，所有的美國媒體才把這個新聞播放出來。中共的媒體能比美國的更早知道。這個行動真的有夠快，比救水还快！


1. August 20, an explosion occurred at the Yongxiang Chemical Plant in Wutongqiao, Leshan, Sichuan. The gas leaked and the residents of the city fled. On the that day, the government denied that there was a gas leak, but the next day it said that a small amount of chlorinated hydrogen mist was leaked and emitted.  The authorities concealed it.
2. Chongqing encountered once-in-a-century flooding, and the entire city was soaked in water. Only the roofs of single-story buildings can be seen. Water still gushes up from the underground tunnel below. What is absurd is that it has not rained recently in Chongqing. The fact is that there are 50,000 dams in the Yangtze River basin.
3. The CCP attributed the food crisis to food waste, saying that food waste was related to criminal activities, and wasting food has been defined as a crime. People living in the Communist China has no human rights, no Rule of law, and no freedom of speech. The fertile fields in 27 provinces have suffered from floods, locust plagues and epidemics.
4. (Bill Gertz, 8/19) (On Cai Xia’s being expelled from the CCP) I think there are voices in the party which are starting to recognize that this is a mafia state, these families are corrupt, they’re stealing from the Chinese people. Clearly Xi Jinping’s ability over the last eight years to brutally consolidate power has created a widespread opposition to his rule both within the party and of course among the Chinese people who hate the Chinese Communist Party; they view the communist party as just a corrupt political entity.
5. (Miles Guo, August 20) Mr. Bannon’s incident, less than 20 minutes after I got to know about it, all the CCP media, CCTV, all other  Chinese communist media, all came out.  And another 20 minutes later, all the American media reported it. The CCP media got to know it even earlier than the American did. The CCP’s media coverage was so fast, much faster than their flood relief actions.
