In the camp in Kunes, Ziawudun’s days drifted into weeks and then months. The detainees’ hair was cut, they went to class, they underwent unexplained medical tests, took pills, and were forcibly injected every 15 days with a “vaccine” that brought on nausea and numbness.

在库纳斯的营地中，齐亚乌敦（Ziawudun）被拘禁的日子持续了数周甚至数月。被拘禁者的头发被剪掉，被破上课，接受不明医学检查，被迫吃药，每15天被强行注射一种“疫苗”，会使人感到恶心和麻木。

Women were forcibly fitted with IUDs or sterilised, Ziawudun said, including a woman who was just about 20 years old. (“We begged them on her behalf,” she said.) Forced sterilisation of Uighurs has been widespread in Xinjiang, according to a recent investigation by the Associated Press. The Chinese government told the BBC the allegations were “completely unfounded”.

齐亚乌敦说，妇女被强行插入宫内节育器（IUDs）或绝育，其中包括一名只有20岁左右的妇女。 （“我们替她向他们求情” 她说。）根据美联社最近的调查，在新疆，维吾尔人被强迫绝育的情况很普遍。中共国政府告诉英国广播公司，这些指控“完全没有根据”。

As well as the medical interventions, detainees in Ziawudun’s camp spent hours singing patriotic Chinese songs and watching patriotic TV programmes about Chinese President Xi Jinping, she said.

她说，除了医疗干预外，在集中营的被拘禁者还被迫花很多时间演唱爱国歌曲，并观看有关中共国国家主席习近平的爱国电视节目。

“You forget to think about life outside the camp. I don’t know if they brainwashed us or if it was the side effect of the injections and pills, but you can’t think of anything beyond wishing you had a full stomach. The food deprivation is so severe.”

“你开始遗忘集中营以外的生活。我不知道是他们在给我们洗脑，还是注射剂和药丸产生了副作用。你除了希望自己可以填饱肚子外，什么都不想。食物匮乏非常的严重。”

Detainees had food withheld for infractions such as failing to accurately memorise passages from books about Xi Jinping, according to a former camp guard who spoke to the BBC via video link from a country outside China.

一名前集中营的警卫通过来自境外国家的视频向BBC揭露，被拘禁者因违规而被扣留食物，例如未能准确记住有关习近平的书籍中的段落。

“Once we were taking the people arrested into the concentration camp, and I saw everyone being forced to memorise those books. They sit for hours trying to memorise the text, everyone had a book in their hands,” he said.

他说：“一旦我们把被捕的人带到集中营，每个人都被强迫背诵这些书里的内容。他们会坐上好几个小时，去背诵书中的内容，每个人手里都有一本书。”

Those who failed tests were forced to wear three different colours of clothing based on whether they had failed one, two, or three times, he said, and subjected to different levels of punishment accordingly, including food deprivation and beatings.

那些考试不及格的人会被迫穿上三种不同颜色的衣服，视一次，两次或三次不及格而定。此外，还会受到不同程度的惩罚，包括扣减食物和殴打。

“I entered those camps. I took detainees into those camps,” he said. “I saw those sick, miserable people. They definitely experienced various types of torture. I am sure about that.”

“我进入了那些集中营。我把被拘禁者带进了那些集中营。我看到了那些生了病的悲惨的人。他们绝对经历了各种形式的酷刑。我非常肯定。”

It was not possible to independently verify the guard’s testimony but he provided documents that appeared to corroborate a period of employment at a known camp. He agreed to speak on condition of anonymity.

我们无法独立核实警卫的证词，但他提供的文件似乎证实了他曾在一个周知的集中营工作过一段时间。他同意在不透露姓名的情况下发声。

The guard said he did not know anything about rape in the cell areas. Asked if the camp guards used electrocution, he said: “Yes. They do. They use those electrocuting instruments.” After being tortured, detainees were forced to make confessions to a variety of perceived offences, according to the guard. “I have those confessions in my heart,” he said.

警卫说，他对牢房内的强奸一无所知。当被问及营中警卫是否使用过电刑时，他说：“是的，他们使用过电刑具。警卫说，在遭受酷刑折磨后，被拘者被迫对各种犯罪行为认罪。他说：“我还记得他们说过的认罪的话。”

President Xi looms large over the camps. His image and slogans adorn the walls; he is a focus of the programme of “re-education”. Xi is the overall architect of the policy against the Uighurs, said Charles Parton, a former British diplomat in China and now senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.

习近平主席的形象在营地可谓随处可见。他的照片和口号装饰在墙上。他是“再教育”项目的中心。习近平是针对维吾尔人政策指定的总架构师。查尔斯·帕顿（Charles Parton），曾任驻中共国英国外交官，现为皇家联合服务学院的高级研究员说道。

“It is very centralised and it goes to the very top,” Parton said. “There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that this is Xi Jinping’s policy.”

“这是非常集中化的政策制定，而且直通最高层。” 帕顿说，“毫无疑问，这是习近平的政策。”

It was unlikely that Xi or other top party officials would have directed or authorised rape or torture, Parton said, but they would “certainly be aware of it”.

帕顿说，习近平或其他党政高层不太可能指示或授权强奸或酷刑，但他们“肯定会意识到”。

“I think they prefer at the top just to turn a blind eye. The line has gone out to implement this policy with great sternness, and that is what is happening.” That left “no real constraints”, he said. “I just don’t see what the perpetrators of these acts would have to hold them back.”

“我认为他们更愿意身居高层却视而不见。严厉地实施这一政策已经越过人性底线了，这就是正在发生的事情。实施这一政策没有任何实际的限制。”他说：“我看不到有任何的行动可以阻止这些肇事者。”

According to Ziawudun’s account, the perpetrators did not hold back.

根据齐亚乌敦的说法，罪犯并没有罢手。

“They don’t only rape but also bite all over your body, you don’t know if they are human or animal,” she said, pressing a tissue to her eyes to stop her tears and pausing for a long time to collect herself.

“他们不仅强奸，还咬你的全身，你都不知道他们到底是人还是动物。”她用纸巾止住眼泪，停顿了很久让自己平静下来 。

“They didn’t spare any part of the body, they bit everywhere leaving horrible marks. It was disgusting to look at.”

“他们不放过你身体的任何一个部位，他们咬每一个地方，留下可怕的印记。看着就令人作呕。”

“I’ve experienced that three times. And it is not just one person who torments you, not just one predator. Each time they were two or three men.”

“我经历过三次。并且不是只有一个掠食者在折磨你，每次都是两个或三个人。”

Later, a woman who slept near Ziawudun in the cell, who said she was detained for giving birth to too many children, disappeared for three days and when she returned her body was covered with the same marks, Ziawudun said.

后来，牢房里一名睡在齐亚乌敦附近的妇女，因为生了太多的孩子而被拘禁。她失踪了三天，当她返回时，她的身上布满了相同的印记。

“She couldn’t say it. She wrapped her arms around my neck and sobbed continuously, but she said nothing.”

“她说不出来。她搂着我的脖子，不停地抽泣，但她什么也没说。”

The Chinese government did not respond directly to questions from the BBC about allegations of rape and torture. In a statement, a spokeswoman said the camps in Xinjiang were not detention camps but “vocational education and training centres”.

中共国政府并没有直接回应英国广播公司有关强奸和酷刑指控的问题。 一位女发言人在一份声明中说，新疆的营地不是集中营，而是“职业教育和培训中心”。

“The Chinese government protects the rights and interests of all ethnic minorities equally,” the spokeswoman said, adding that the government “attaches great importance to protecting women’s rights”.

发言人说：“政府平等地保护所有少数民族的权益。” 并补充说，政府“非常重视保护妇女的权利”。

Ziawudun was released in December 2018 along with others who had spouses or relatives in Kazakhstan – an apparent policy shift she still doesn’t fully understand.

齐亚乌敦于2018年12月与在哈萨克斯坦（Kazakhstan）有配偶或亲戚的其他人一起被释放——她并不完全理解这一政策的转变。

The state returned her passport and she fled to Kazakhstan and then, with the support of the Uyghur Human Rights Project, to the US. She is applying to stay. She lives in a quiet suburb not far from Washington DC with a landlady from the local Uighur community. The two women cook together and take walks in the streets around the house. It’s a slow, uneventful existence. Ziawudun keeps the lights low when she is in the house, because they shone brightly and constantly in the camp. A week after she arrived in the US, she had surgery to remove her womb – a consequence of being stamped on. “I have lost the chance to become a mother,” she said. She wants her husband to join her in the US. For now, he is in Kazakhstan.

中共国归还了她的护照，她逃到哈萨克斯坦，随后通过《维吾尔人权项目》（Uyghur Human Rights Project）逃往美国。 她正在申请留在美国。 她生活在一个离华盛顿特区不远的安静郊区，房东来自当地的维吾尔族社区。 她与房东一起做饭，在街道散步。 这是一种舒缓，平稳的生活。齐亚乌敦在房间里会把灯光调暗。因为在集中营里，灯光刺眼，并且持续不断。 到达美国一周后，她接受了子宫切除手术——这是遭受虐待的结果。 她说：“我失去了成为母亲的机会。” 她希望丈夫能够来美国与她会合。 目前，她的丈夫还在哈萨克斯坦。

For a while after her release, before she could flee, Ziawudun waited in Xinjiang. She saw others who had been churned through the system and released. She saw the effect the policy was having on her people. The birth rate in Xinjiang has plummeted in the past few years, according to independent research – an effect analysts have described as “demographic genocide”.

齐亚乌敦在被释放并设法逃离之前的一段时间内，在新疆等待。她见到其他被这个系统迫害，后来又被释放的人。她看到了该政策对她的民族的影响。根据独立研究，新疆的出生率在过去几年中直线下降——分析师将其描述为“人口种族灭绝”。

Many in the community had turned to alcohol, Ziawudun said. Several times, she saw her former cellmate collapsed on the street – the young woman who was removed from the cell with her that first night, who she heard screaming in an adjacent room. The woman had been consumed by addiction, Ziawudun said. She was “like someone who simply existed, otherwise she was dead, completely finished by the rapes”.

齐亚乌敦说，社区中的许多人已经开始酗酒。有几次，她看到她的前狱友昏倒在街上——那名年轻女子在第一天晚上与她一起被带出了牢房，她随后听到了那位年轻女子在隔壁房间里的尖叫声。 齐亚乌敦说，这名妇女被毒瘾所吞噬，她“只是一个活着的人而已，其实她已经死了，完全被强奸毁了”。

“They say people are released, but in my opinion everyone who leaves the camps is finished.”

“政府说人们被释放了，但我认为离开集中营的每个人都被毁了。”

And that, she said, was the plan. The surveillance, the internment, the indoctrination, the dehumanisation, the sterilisation, the torture, the rape.

她说，那正是政府的计划。监视，拘禁，灌输，灭绝人性，绝育，酷刑和强奸。

“Their goal is to destroy everyone,” she said. “And everybody knows it.”

“他们的目标是摧毁所有人，” 她说，“而且每个人都知道这一点。”
