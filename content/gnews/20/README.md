英文標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep238: China “the digital RBM bears no interest.”

視頻重點

1. 央行副行長“數字人民幣不計息”上微博熱搜，網絡炸鍋！並且，如無違反規定，各機構不得拒收數字貨幣.
2. 哈爾濱：CCP政府不負責醫院養老金，引發抗議 ，呼兰紅十字醫院的醫生和護士都在醫院外面抗议說：我們要養老！我們要吃飯 ！ 是什么让这些为社会做出贡献的医务人员得不到养老的保障？
3. （阿裏郎新聞，9/17）去年一家生物製藥公司發生泄露事件後中共國西北地區數千人感染了布魯氏菌病。  蘭州市衛生委表示，截至9月14日21847人接受了檢測，3245人感染了這種疾病。
4. （史蒂夫∙班農，9/17）你遭到所有（來自德國納粹的）災難因為你沒有在1933年、 1934-1935年站起來反抗。歸根到底是要麼反抗要麼玩完。他們（中共）有生物武器計劃，大家都知道。為什麼？因為他們無法在核武器上，無法在軍事上與我們競爭。
5. （9/17）川普總統當年兩萬五在那塊兒停了好長時間，我記得一兩年好像是。皮特•納瓦羅現在都沒超過我們科學家。一天就幹到五萬九去了。 不停哪？不被黑哪？這就叫正義。


1. The China Central Bank’s deputy governor said, “the digital RBM bears no interest.” The comment was actively browsed on hot Weibo, and it triggered uproar on internet. And, if there is no violation of the rules, no institution shall refuse to accept the digital Yuan.
2. In Harbin, the comment that the CCP government will not pay for hospital staff pensions triggered protests.  Doctors and nurses of Hulan Red Cross Hospital were protesting outside the hospital: “We request retirement pension covered! We need social security to live on! ”   What violates the pension right of these hospital staff who have made contributions to society?
3. (Arirang News, 9/17) Thousands of people in northwest China have been infected with the brucellosis after a leak at a biopharmaceutical company last year. The Health Commission of Lanzhou said as of September 14th, 21,847 people have been tested, and 3,245 people have contracted the disease.
4. (Steve Bannon, 9/17) You got it all because you didn’t stand up in 1933, 34, 35. It all comes either stand up or not. They have biological weapons where everybody knows that. Why? Because they can’t compete with us with nuclear weapons, they can’t compete with the military.
5. (9/17)  President Trump’s Twitter account was stuck at around 25,000 followers for one or two years as I remembered. Peter Navarro’s account still has fewer followers than Dr. Yan’s. Dr. Yan had more than 59,000 followers only in one day. What if it were not suspended or hacked? This is what we call justice.
