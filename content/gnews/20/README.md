On December 14, the Hong Kong media revealed that all 180,000 civil servants will have to swear allegiance to the government at the end of the month at the earliest. Those who refuse to take the oath will be fired directly. Those who take the oath will be dismissed or directly ordered to retire if they misbehave or break the oath in the future! In short, whether you take oaths or not, neither has good results. Some people refused to take the oath.

This news tells us that Hong Kong, under the control of the Chinese Communist Party, is becoming more and more abject and is all operating according to the template set by the Chinese Communist Party long ago. The word allegiance is not at all new to mainlanders, especially those over 60 years old.  The most typical was the Cultural Revolution launched during the Maoist era. The Cultural Revolution had six main themes: 1. glorification and allegiance, 2. revolution and struggle, 3. heroes and role models, 4. contrast between old and new, 5. progress and backwardness, 6. love and affection. The Chinese Communist Party puts glorification and allegiance in the first place, which shows that the Chinese Communist Party requires the people to be absolutely loyal to the Party leadership. The most representative literary work that asked people to glorify, praise and appreciate the Chinese Communist Party as an expression of reverence for the Party and Mao Zedong, as well as for the theoretical doctrine and system they believed in, was the “Loyalty Dance.” Decades have passed, and the damage done to mainlanders by the Ten-Year Cultural Revolution has persisted. When Xi Jinping came to power, his policy was to retrace the Maoist line all over again. It is not difficult to see the shadow of the Cultural Revolution in our culture in these years. The songs of that era can be heard everywhere in the big cities. Old people wearing straw green uniforms, red armbands, and holding red books can be seen dancing the loyalty dance on the stage, on the street, in the park, etc. These are not accidental; they are the inevitable product of retracing the route. It is also the CCP’s all-encompassing indoctrination into the ideology of the Cultural Revolution, disguised as glorification of the Cultural Revolution, and brainwashing tactics planted deep into people’s heads.

Officials are also popping up all over the china to show loyalty to the CCP and to Xi Jinping. In 2016, Li Hongzhong, who had just become secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee, shouted for the first time at a meeting: absolute loyalty. It is to imply his loyalty to Xi Jinping. Four years later, Secretary of Shandong Provincial Committee liu dingyi, ,publicly stated in Jinan cadre adjustment: absolute loyalty to the General Secretary.

The legacy of the Cultural Revolution has been clamping down on people’s minds, and there are countless people who want to be promoted and get rich, thinking that by showing loyalty and allegiance they can have a bright career, but in fact the officials are just a tool of the rulers.

Today’s Hong Kong, the demonic wind has long been rampant, the villain in power, settle scores at an opportune moment; curb freedom, to eliminate the street march, control the mind, unified brainwashing is in full swing. It is not surprising that all civil servants have to take an oath of allegiance. But I believe that Hong Kong people have been living under the British mindset for a long time, their pursuit of freedom, democracy and human rights will not change. Hong Kong is only a temporary setback, freedom, democracy and rights will definitely come back!
