全文：

Had a little walk around here, and it felt so good! Did a lap around here, not bad at all! Did a lap, really, not bad! Too many surveillance systems [along the way], “Click, click, click, click, click…” Look! Look! Surveillance system like this one, as you can see, is everywhere.

走了走路，真舒服啊！哈哈！兜一圈，相当的不孬！兜一圈相当的，相当的不孬！太多监控系统，“咔咔咔咔咔…”你看看你看看！就这监控系统，你说无处不在。

Currently, the CCP has installed the most surveillance systems in the world, and they have sold their weapons of surveillance. It turns out that the CCP has now been completely screwed over by their own surveillance systems. The evidence of genocide and mass killing, as well as the making of the virus, have all been obtained. Look at this thing, look at this thing! So one should never do evil. The truth can’t be fake, and the fake can’t be true. Eventually, everything will be revealed to the public. Believe it or not, the CCP is the best example. Brothers and sisters, what can the NFSC and the Whistleblower Movement bring to everybody? “Only truth is unbreakable.”

现在共产党布着全天下最多的监控系统，卖出了监控的武器。结果共产党现在被自己的监控系统彻底拿下。掌握了绝对的灭绝人寰的人类大屠杀、种族大屠杀，还有制造病毒，都被拿下。你说这玩意儿，你说这玩意儿！所以说人哪，别做恶。真的假不了，假的真不了，最后一切都会大白于天下。相信不？共产党就是你最好的例子。兄弟姐妹们，新中国联邦、爆料革命给大家带来的是什么？唯真不破。

In no case should you do evil, and you should never believe that trying to be clever will work. Don’t use gods, spirits, or your hypocrisy to cover up your greed. Admit it if you are greedy, admit it if you are narrow minded, which is human nature. But one should not infringe on the interests of others. Moreover, one should not believe that it’s his or her opportunity out of other people’s stupidity. Are other people really stupid? Haven’t they seen it through? That’s because they just aren’t willing to say it.

千万别做恶，千万别以为自己[的]小聪明[能管用]。不要用上帝，也不要用神，不要用你的[伪]善良，来掩盖你的贪婪。贪就是贪，有小心眼儿就[是]有小心眼儿，人之常情。但是不能侵犯别人的利益，更不要相信别人的愚蠢是你的机会。别人傻？别人没看见？那是人家不愿意说透。

Don’t act like the CCP. If you tell the CCP that, I want to withdraw money from my bank, and also I want to be fed, and I want to get paid. The CCP will say, “Hey, let’s talk about dream and passion.” Right? If you say, “I just want to get my things back.” It will say, “Then let’s talk about sacrifice and devotion.” Right? Whenever you say, “I need to feed my family.” It will say, “Hey, you need to talk about selflessness, and learn from Lei Feng! [a hero figure in CCP’s propaganda campaigns]”

你别像共产党似的。你给共产党一说，我要取银行的钱，我也想吃饱饭，我想给我发工资。共产党说：哎，讲情怀啊，是不是？我拿回属于我自己的。，那得讲奉献啊，是吧？给共产党一说：我家里人需要养活。哎？你要讲无私啊，你要学雷锋啊！

S.O.B.! You [the CCP] took away money [from people]. You took away people’s lives. You took away public interest, and you not only own more wealth than the whole population of some nations, but you are almost controlling the whole universe! You push the people to advocate sacrifice and devotion, and not to do anything to benefit themselves, but people can only benefit you. This S.O.B. CCP has now been monitored by the surveillance systems built by itself. Oops! Won’t say anymore! I accidentally said too much, right? Okay, okay, okay. Gotta go! Gotta go! Coming, Coming! [As] soon [as] possible. Ho-ho, ho-ho, I am not allowed to talk too much.

王八蛋！你们拿[走]的钱，你们拿[走]的人命，你们拿[走]的利益，不是富可敌国，你们快控制全宇宙啦！叫人民讲奉献、讲无私。不能有利己，只讲利你们。这个王八蛋的共产党，现在自己建的监控系统，把自己给控了。哟，不说了，一说就说漏了，是卜？好好好，马上走！马上走！Coming,Coming! [As] soon [as] possible. 呵呵呵呵呵，不叫我说那么多。
