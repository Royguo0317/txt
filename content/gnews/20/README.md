## 川普總統8.13新聞發佈會精要(中英文)
`2020-08-19 06:29 GM31` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hant/302772/)

川普總統于2020年8月13日舉行新聞發佈會，報告了最新新冠情況和疫苗進展，對比了川普政府和喬·拜登的所作所為，宣佈了與以色列和阿聯酋達成了歷史性和平協議，回答了關於郵寄選票，和平協議，聯合國演講，以及中國和香港相關的問題，表示以色列暫停了在西岸的定居點活動是朝著實現和平邁出的大膽一步。



It was just announced by Attorney General Barr two minutes ago that they’ve caught the killer of LeGend Taliferro — a wonderful young man horribly shot. As you know, we named Operation LeGend after LeGend Taliferro, where we’re in the process of helping out, cities throughout our country that have difficulty with crime — in particular, certain types of crime.

兩分鐘前，司法部長巴爾剛剛宣佈，他們抓獲了殺害勒根德·塔利費羅的兇手——被槍殺的一個很好的年輕人。如你所知，我們以勒根德·塔利費羅命名傳奇（LeGend）行動，我們正在幫助全國各地的有犯罪難題的城市，尤其是某些類型的犯罪。

Today, we saw Joe Biden continue to politicize a pandemic and to show his appalling lack of respect for the American people. At every turn, Biden has been wrong about the virus, ignoring the scientific evidence and putting left-wing politics before facts and evidence.

今天，我們看到喬·拜登繼續將疫情政治化，顯示出他對美國人民極不尊重。拜登對病毒的看法每次都是錯誤的，罔顧科學證據，把左翼政治置於事實和證據之上。

Sleepy Joe opposed both the China and the Europe travel bans that I instituted very early. According to many people if I listened to his advice, hundreds of thousands more people would have died. I believe that Dr. Fauci agreed with that. He said that President Trump made a great decision when he put the ban on China.

瞌睡蟲喬反對我很早就實行的中國和歐洲旅行禁令。很多人說，如果我聽了他的建議，將會有幾十萬人死亡。我相信福奇博士也同意這一點。他說，川普總統對中國實施禁令是一個偉大的決定。

Joe Biden wants to fling open American borders, allowing the pandemic to infiltrate every U.S. community based on his policies. I’ve been saying from the first day I started campaigning for this great office that if you have open borders, you don’t have a country. So he and the Democrats wants to have ridiculous open borders. And if you take a look at our southern border, we would allow rioters and looters and criminals and millions of illegal aliens to roam free in our country. The wall is getting close to 290 miles long, and it’s having a huge impact. That’s one of the many things that we disagree with.

喬·拜登希望開放美國國界，他的政策會導致疫情滲透到美國每個社區裡。我從開始為這個偉大的職位競選的第一天起就一直在說，如果國界開放了國家就不存在了。他和民主黨想要愚蠢地開放國界。如果你看看我們的南部邊境，我們就會讓暴亂者、搶劫者、罪犯和數百萬非法移民在我們的國家逍遙法外。這堵邊境牆已經接近290英里長了，它產生了巨大的影響。這是我們之間分歧的許多事情之一。

Joe Biden wants the federal government to issue a sweeping new mandate to law-abiding citizens. He wants the President of the United States, with the mere stroke of a pen, to order over 300 million law-abiding American citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of three straight months; he thinks it’s good politics, no matter where they live and no matter their surroundings. Because different states are much different, both in terms of the atmosphere itself and also in terms of the Corona problem.

喬·拜登希望聯邦政府向守法公民發佈新的全面強制。他希望美國總統，僅大筆一揮，就命令3億多守法的美國公民至少連續三個月戴口罩; 他認為這是好政策，不管他們住在哪裡，也不管他們周圍的環境。因為各州的氣候或新冠問題是非常不同的。

Also, many of our 50 states are doing the job at a level that frankly, people are really surprised, including foreign governments that are calling us constantly and asking for advice. So I want to just say our governors have worked very hard. They’ve worked with Vice President Pence and myself and everybody else that’s been going. We have Scott now involved.

此外，我們50個州中許多州做的工作，包括外國政府不斷打電話給我們以徵求意見，坦率說實在出乎意料之外。我想說，我們的州長們工作非常努力。他們與彭斯副總統、我和其他所有工作人員合作。我們現在讓斯科特也參與進來了。

Joe Biden does not identify what authority the President has to issue such a mandate or how federal law enforcement could possibly enforce it or why we would be stepping on governors throughout our country, many of whom have done a very good job and they know what is needed. If the President has the unilateral power to order every single citizen to cover their face in nearly all instances, what other powers does he have? That’s why Biden refused to take questions, he couldn’t answer any of them. I take questions; He never takes questions, although some can be nasty they’re not that difficult.

喬·拜登沒有指明總統有什麼權力發佈這樣的強制要求，或聯邦執法部門如何強制執行，或者為什麼我們對全國的州長指手畫腳，他們中的許多人都做得很好，他們知道他們需要什麼。如果總統有單方面權力命令每個公民在幾乎所有情況下都掩蓋他們的面部，他還有什麼其他權力？這就是為什麼拜登拒絕回答提問，他不能回答任何提問。我回答提問;他從不回答這些雖然有時很討厭，但並不難回答的提問。

My administration has a different approach: We have urged Americans to wear masks. And I emphasized this is a patriotic thing to do. So we’ve been saying wear them when it’s appropriate, especially in terms of social distancing, if you can’t distance enough. Maybe they’re great and maybe they’re just good. Maybe they’re not so good. But frankly, what do you have to lose? You have nothing to lose. But again, it’s up to the governors. We want to have a certain freedom. That’s what we’re about.

我的政府有不同的做法：我們敦促美國人戴口罩。我強調這是一件愛國行為。所以我們一直說在合適的時候戴，特別是在保持社交距離時，如你不能保持足夠遠的距離就要戴。也許他們很棒，也許他們只是很好，也許他們沒那麼好。但老實說，你又有什麼損失？你沒有什麼可損失的。但是，這要由州長決定。我們希望有一定的自由。這就是我們要說的。

At the same time, we also understand that each state is different and is facing very unique differences and circumstances. We’ve entrusted the governors of each state, elected by the people, to develop and enforce their own mask policies and other policies, following guidance from the federal government and CDC. We’re working with each state to implement a plan based on the facts and science. We will continue to urge Americans to wear masks when they cannot socially distance, but we do not need to bring the full weight of the federal government down on law-abiding Americans to accomplish this goal. Americans must have their freedoms. And I trust the American people and their governors very much. I trust the governors want to do the right thing to make the smart decisions, and Joe doesn’t. Joe doesn’t know too much.

同時，我們也明白，每個州都是不同的，各自面臨著非常獨特的環境和情況。我們委託每個州的民選州長，在聯邦政府和疾控中心的指導下，制定和執行他們自己的口罩政策和其他政策。我們正在與每個州合作，根據事實和科學以實施計畫。我們將繼續敦促美國人在不能保持社交距離時戴口罩，但我們不需要用整個聯邦政府勢力打壓守法的美國人，以實現這個目標。美國人必須擁有自己的自由。我非常信任美國人民和他們的州長。我相信州長們想做正確的事，明智的決定，而喬則不想。喬不太懂。

Unlike the Biden approach, our approach is guided by science. That’s why we’re focused on protecting the high-risk Americans. That is why we’re delivering effective medical treatments to dramatically reduce the fatality rate. And that is why we’re developing a vaccine and therapeutics in record time.

與拜登的做法不同，我們的方法以科學為指導。這就是為什麼我們專注于保護高風險美國人。這就是為什麼我們提供有效的醫療來大幅降低死亡率。這就是為什麼我們要在創紀錄的時間內開發疫苗和治療方法。

Sleepy Joe rejects the scientific approach in favor of locking all Americans in their basements for months on end, which I think is something that Scott would be very opposed to. We’ve been dealing pretty strongly over the last number of weeks. And you have governors that have been very, very strict on keeping people in their houses, apartments, or wherever they may be. And frankly, I don’t think the results are necessarily better than other results. But he wants to by a federal decree, shut down our economy, close our schools, and grind society to a halt. This would lead to a crippling long-lasting depression.

瞌睡蟲喬拒絕科學方法，贊成把所有美國人都鎖在地下室裡幾個月，我認為斯科特對此會非常反對的。在過去的幾周裡，我們一直非常有力地處理。但某些州長們嚴格要求人們呆在自己的房子裡，公寓裡，或不管身在何處，而這樣的結果，坦率地說，我不認為比其他的結果好。但他想通過聯邦法令，關閉我們的經濟，關閉我們的學校，使社會停滯不前。這將導致嚴重的長期經濟衰退。

And yesterday, I showed you the numbers about how well we’re doing coming back with auto sales and auto manufacturing and used car sales and housing sales at numbers that nobody would have believed. And we’re back and very strong. It’s a very strong “V.” It’s almost a straight-up “V.” The economy is coming back, and the employment numbers over the last three months are a record in history of our country. And we’ll be back next year. I think we’ll be maybe even stronger than the previous years, where we set every record in the book: unemployment and stock market. By the way, our stock market numbers are very close to record. And NASDAQ is actually a record for 14 times now. And that’s during what we hope will be the more final stages of the pandemic.

昨天，我向你們展示了我們復蘇後的資料，在汽車銷售和製造以及二手車銷售和住房銷售方面令人不可思議的資料。我們強勢回歸了。這是一個非常強勁的V形。這幾乎是一個直接的V形。經濟正在復蘇，過去三個月的就業資料創下了我國歷史紀錄。明年我們還會回來，也許會比失業率和股市創紀錄的前幾年更強。順便說一下，我們的股市資料非常接近創紀錄。而納斯達克實際上已經創紀錄了14次，這是我們希望在疫情最終階段內發生的。

So if we did those punitive shutdowns Biden wanted to do, it would shut down our healthcare system and lead to a massive increase in mortality, including depression, suicide, overdose, alcohol, drugs, heart disease, and countless other physical and mental harms, very bad on the other side of the equation.

如果我們按照拜登的意思去實施這些懲戒性的封鎖，就會癱瘓我們的醫療系統，導致死亡率大增，包括抑鬱、自殺、用藥過量、酒精、毒品、心臟病和無數其他身心傷害，後果將是非常非常糟糕的。

Biden’s approach is regressive, anti-scientific and it’s very defeatist, very bad for our country. While Joe Biden has been playing politics from the sidelines, he has no clue we’ve been solving problems and delivering tremendous results; the most advanced and robust testing system on the planet; the number one producer of ventilators in the world, by far; unprecedented industrial mobilization — biggest since World War Two; Operation Warp Speed to deliver lifesaving treatments and, very soon, a vaccine.

拜登的做法是倒退的，反科學的，非常失敗的，對我們國家非常不利。當喬·拜登一直在袖手旁觀玩弄政治時，他卻不知道我們一直在解決問題，並取得巨大的成果; 地球上最先進、最強大的檢測系統;迄今為止呼吸機的世界第一大生產商;史無前例的，自二戰以來規模最大的一次工業動員;“神速行動”，提供救命的治療，而且很快就會有疫苗。

What a plan by Joe Biden has actually laid out would do, we’ve really, already, accomplished. In fact, many of the things that was well reported over the last few days — every single thing he said to do, every single thing we did, and we did them well. So Biden has no idea on his own. He only knows what he thinks we should do, and he spews it out, and then he “plagiarizes”, because every single one of the events was something we had already done.

實際上喬·拜登所制定的計畫，我們其實已經完成了。實際上，這幾天報導的很多事情——他說要做的每一件事，就是我們做過的事，而且每件事我們都做得很好。所以拜登沒有自己的想法。他只知道他認為我們應該做什麼，他張嘴就來了，然後他就“剽竊”了，因為每一個事件都是我們已經做過的事情。

So we’ll defeat the virus, but not by hiding in our basements. He’s got to come out of his basement. We’ll defeat this virus through a commonsense mitigation effort, shielding those at highest risk, and unleashing America’s medical and scientific genius. And we’ve already been doing it, and we’re very close to having very special therapeutics and vaccines.

我們將戰勝病毒，但不是躲在地下室裡。他必須從地下室出來。我們將通過常識性的緩解措施來擊敗這種病毒，保護最高風險的人群，發揮美國的醫學和科學才能。我們已經在做了，我們非常接近擁有非常特殊的療法和疫苗。

To Joe, I would say: Stop playing politics with a virus. Too serious. Partisan politics has no place here. It’s a shameful situation for anybody to try and score political points while we’re working to save lives and defeat the pandemic. We are working with countries from all over the world, and they’re trying to learn from us. And some of the countries that you spoke most well about are having a tremendous surge right now. But it’ll work out. In times of national challenge, Americans must unite together and they must put politics aside and have to really unite for a common good.

我要對喬說：別再用病毒玩弄政治了。太嚴重了。黨派政治在這裡沒有立足之地。當我們努力拯救生命和戰勝疫情時，任何人試圖在政治上得分，都是可恥的。我們正在與世界各國合作，他們也正試圖向我們學習。你講得最好的一些國家現在正經臨著疫情的巨大衝擊，但會有辦法的。在國家面臨挑戰的時候，美國人必須團結在一起，他們必須把政治放一邊，必須真正的同舟共濟。

Three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials. They’re doing really well. We’re producing the most promising vaccine candidates in advance; as you know, part of the largest industrialization ever.

三種疫苗處於臨床試驗的最後階段。疫苗試驗情況良好。我們正在提前生產最有前途的疫苗候選者;如你所知，這是有史以來最大規模工業生產的一部分。

It’s incredible, when I meet with heads of companies that are doing this — that are the best companies anywhere in the world — it’s incredible where they are, how they’re doing, and the speed with which they’re doing it, and also the speed with which the FDA is approving things, because by any other standard, you would have been two or three years away from being at the point that we’re at.

難以置信，當我與這些正在開發疫苗的世界上最好的公司負責人會面，他們的進展，表現，速度，以及食品藥品監管局（FDA）批准的速度，令人難以置信。因為以任何其他標準，離我們目前這個地步原本還要兩到三年的時間。

By the end of this week, we will have shipped 1,846 rapid point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes, which are a very important source for people that are not handling the plague from China very well. This week alone, we’re sending 992 testing devices and 450,000 tests to more than 950 nursing homes across the country. And these tests are incredible. These are tests that are all new, very modern.

本周結束前，我們將向養老院運送1846台快速護理點檢測設備，對於那些沒有很好地處理來自中國的瘟疫的人來說，這是一個非常重要的資源。僅本周，我們就向全國950多家養老院發送了992台以上的檢測設備和45萬次測試。這些測試令人難以置信。這些都是新的，非常現代的測試。

And we’re also getting on the tests that are not done immediately, with the 5- to 15-minute timing, when they do send them to a lab, they’re coming back now in three days. So it’s a three-day process, which is about as good as you can do. You have one day of delivering, one day of receiving, and one day in the lab. We’re also requiring all nursing homes to test all members of their staff at least weekly.

我們還在進行那些5到15分鐘非即刻完成的檢測，當把檢測樣本送到實驗室時，三天后就回來了。一個為期三天的過程，這是目前能做的最好的。一天提交，一天接收，一天在實驗室。我們還要求所有養老院至少每週對全體員工進行檢測。

By unleashing America’s scientific genius, we have delivered effective treatments. The case fatality rate for Americans over 70 has declined by about 85 percent. That’s a fantastic number. Europe has seen 40 percent more excess mortality than the United States compared to a non-pandemic year.

We continue to urge all Americans to wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask when necessary and when you cannot distance, and protect — very importantly — the vulnerable. Protect people that are older and especially people that have problems with heart or diabetes or some other problem.

通過發揮美國的科學才能，我們提供了有效的治療。70歲以上的美國人的病例死亡率下降了約85%。這是一個很棒的數字。跟非瘟疫年間相比，歐洲的死亡率比美國高出40%。我們繼續敦促所有美國人洗手，保持社交距離，必要時和在不能保持距離時戴上口罩，而最重要的是保護弱勢群體，保護老年人，尤其是那些有心臟或糖尿病或其他問題的人。

Earlier today, very exciting news — very big news all over the world; they’re talking about it all over the world. It was amazing. We finalized a historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. After half a century, Israel and the United Arab Emirates will fully normalize their diplomatic relations. Nobody thought this was something that could happen for a long time. This is the most important diplomatic breakthrough since the Egypt-Israel peace agreement signed over 40 years ago.

We have Ambassador to Israel David Friedman here. Thank you, David, for being here. You’ve been fantastic ambassador and representative of our country. Would you agree that this was a big day for Israel and a big day for the world?

今天早些時候，非常令人興奮的消息轟動了全球。我們完成了以色列和阿拉伯聯合大公國之間的歷史性和平協定。半個世紀後，以色列和阿拉伯聯合大公國將全面實現外交關係正常化。很久以來，沒人想到會發生這樣的事情。這是40多年前簽訂的埃及-以色列和平協定以來最重要的外交突破。我們有駐以色列大使大衛·弗裡德曼。大衛，感謝你的到來。你一直是我們國家的傑出大使和代表。你是否同意這是以色列的大日子，也是世界的大日子？

The deal that was reached today will enable Muslims to have far greater ability to visit many historic sites in Israel and to peacefully pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is very important to them, which they’ve wanted to have access to for many, many decades. This is a monumental step to forging ties of cooperation in the Middle East. And I think you’re going to have other countries come forward. I can tell you we already do, and they want to make a deal. They’re going to have peace in the Middle East. It’ll be fantastic.

今天達成的協議將使穆斯林們能夠更有能力參觀以色列的許多歷史遺跡，並在阿克薩清真寺和平祈禱，這對他們來說非常重要，他們幾十年來一直想去那裡。這是建立中東合作關係巨大的一步。我認為其他國家也將會站出來，我可以告訴你，這已經發生了，他們想達成協議。他們將在中東實現和平。那真是太棒了

Israel is also suspending settlements in the West Bank, which is a big deal — a bold step toward achieving peace. Israel and the United Arab Emirates have also agreed to immediately expand and accelerate scientific collaboration to develop effective treatments and vaccines to defeat the China virus and to save lives in their region and in their world — virtually each of every 188 country has been hit. So they are working very much on the vaccines, also with us. Our unprecedented diplomatic engagements laid the groundwork for this historic peace agreement, which was just announced a little while ago, today.

以色列還暫停了在西岸的定居點活動，這是一件大事——朝著實現和平邁出的大膽一步。以色列和阿拉伯聯合大公國也同意立即擴大和加速科學合作，以開發有效的治療方法和疫苗，以戰勝中國病毒並拯救本地區和世界的生命——188個國家幾乎每一個國家都遭受到打擊。因此，他們正和我們合作非常努力地研製疫苗。我們史無前例的外交接觸為今天剛剛宣佈的這項歷史性的和平協定奠定了基礎。

We will not rest as we continue to work toward a world of greater harmony and prosperity for all. I want to thank Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates for their vision and their leadership. And I look forward to hosting them at the White House very soon to formally sign the agreement. And they’ll probably be coming to Washington over the next three weeks.

我們不會停歇，因為我們將繼續努力為所有人創造一個更加和諧和繁榮的世界。我要感謝以色列的總理本雅明·內塔尼亞胡，和阿拉伯聯合大公國的王儲穆罕默德·本·紮耶德他們的遠見和領導才能。我期待著很快在白宮接待他們正式簽署協議。他們大概會在接下來的三星期裡拜訪華盛頓。

So that was a tremendous day. That was a tremendous thing that happened. And it’s a great sign. We have a lot of other interesting things going on with other nations, also having to do with peace agreements. And a lot of big news is coming over the next few weeks, and I’m sure you’ll be very impressed. And more importantly, it’s a great thing for our country, a great thing for the world.

所以，這是偉大的一天。這是發生的大事。及一個很好的徵兆。我們跟其他國家正進行很多與和平協議有關的其他有趣的事情。在接下來的幾周裡，會有很多重大新聞發生，我相信你們會印象深刻。更重要的是，這對我們國家來說是好事，對世界來說也是好事。

記者提問：

Q: One of the real problems when you shut down the schools: These are kids on reduced and free lunch programs; they need these meals to make it through their day. And with districts shutting down school, what, if anything, can the federal government do to make sure that the kids still get decent meals, as long as the schools are out?

問：當你關閉學校時，一個實際問題是那些在減免午餐計畫內的孩子;他們需要這些飯菜來維持他們的每一天。隨著各學區關閉學校，聯邦政府能做些什麼，以確保學校停課期間孩子們仍然得到不錯的膳食？

President Trump: Well, you know we don’t want the schools shut down. We want the schools to open. All children, but especially very young children handle it very well. We’ve made payment. And frankly, if the school isn’t going to open, we would much rather give the money to the child, meaning the parents of the child, and let the parents do what they have to do, including bringing the child to another school, because we’re finding that whether it’s parents or children, people want to get back to school. They want to have their life back.

川普總統：你知道我們不想讓學校關閉。我們希望學校開放。所有的孩子，但特別是很小的孩子都能很好地處理閉校。我們已經提供了資助。坦率地說，如果學校不開學，我們寧願把錢提供給孩子們，也就是孩子們的父母，讓父母們去做他們能做的，包括帶孩子去別的學校，因為我們發現，無論是父母還是孩子，人們都想回到學校。他們想恢復自己的生活。

Some people say the Democrats don’t want schools open, because that’s where you have a lot of polling booths. And if you have a school close, you can’t very easily have polling booths at the school. I think maybe we’ll be able to show that as fact, but that’s another thing that they’re doing to try and keep people away from the polls. So we have to look into that, but you’ve been reading about it, I’ve been reading about it, and I don’t like it. But we’d like to see the schools open. Then we don’t have that problem.

有人說民主黨不希望學校開放是因為學校裡有很多投票站。而如果學校關閉了，你就不能輕易在學校設立投票站。也許我們可以把它作為證據來展示出來，但這是他們正在做的，試圖讓人們遠離投票的另外一件事。因此，我們必須對此調查一下，你看到了，我也看到了，我並不喜歡它。但我們希望看到學校開放。那我們就沒有問題了。

Q: Mr. President, what’s your understanding of how long Israel will suspend this West Bank annexation plan?

問：總統先生，以您的理解以色列將會暫停這一西岸吞併計畫多久？

Ambassador Friedman: Well, we’re putting all our eggs into the basket of peace. We have an agreement with the Emirates. We’re going to nail down all the details — embassies, overflights, commercial — and then we’re going to extrapolate that to the rest of the region. How long that takes, I can’t tell you. But that’s — we’ve prioritized peace over the sovereignty movement, but it’s not off the table. It’s just something that will be deferred until we give peace every single chance.

弗裡德曼大使：我們為和平傾其所有。我們已與阿聯酋達成了協定。我們將確定大使館，越界飛行，商業方面的細節，然後我們將其推廣到該地區的其他地方。我不能告訴你具體要多久。但是，我們置和平優先於主權運動，但這還在談判桌上，只是將推遲到我們用完和平的每一個機會。

Q: What do you want the Palestinians to take away from this deal, since they’re not really a party to it?

問：您希望巴勒斯坦人從這項協議中得到什麼，因為他們並不是協議的一方？

President Trump: Well, but they are supported largely by some of the countries that we’re talking to and that have already signed — you know, in the case of the one country. But others will be following. And I think the Palestinians will — without saying it necessarily yet, I think they very much want to be a part of what we’re doing. And I see, ultimately, peace between Israel and the Palestinians. I see that happening. I think as these very big, powerful, wealthy countries come in, I think the Palestinians will follow, quite naturally.

川普總統：但是他們得到的支持主要來自一些和我們談判的或已經簽署（協議）的國家——你應該知道其中一個國家。但其他國家也會效仿。我認為巴勒斯坦人——雖然不能說是肯定的，我想他們很想參與到我們正在做的事情裡。我認為，以色列和巴勒斯坦之間最終將實現和平。我能預見這種情況發生。我認為，隨著這些非常強大、富裕的國家參與進來，我認為巴勒斯坦人將自然而然地效仿。

Q: Do you believe that a deal could have been reached without Israel’s agreement to temporarily suspend annexation?

問：您認為，如果以色列不同意暫時停止吞併，是否可以達成協議？

Ambassador Friedman: I think you can’t do both at the same time. So I think, again, prioritize peace. Sovereignty after peace is given every opportunity to (inaudible) to sovereignty. I don’t think the two could have been done at the same time.

弗裡德曼大使：我認為你不能同時做到這兩點。因此，我認為，重申，優先考慮和平。和平後被給予一切可能性後才輪到主權。我認為兩者不可能同時完成。

Q: And have you asked Israel to permanently consider abandoning annexation?

問：您是否要求以色列考慮永久放棄吞併？

Ambassador Friedman: No, this is a temporary process. There’s been no request.

弗裡德曼大使：不，這是一個臨時過程。沒有提出要求。

Q: This morning you said that you do not want to fund the U.S. Postal Service because Democrats are trying to expand voting by mail. Are you threatening to veto any legislation that includes funding for the Post Office?

問：今天上午，你說你不想資助美國郵政服務，因為民主黨正試圖擴大投票的郵件。您是否威脅要否決任何包括為郵局提供資金的立法？

President Trump: No, not at all. No.

川普總統：不，一點也不。不。

Q: So you would sign something that does include funding?

問：那麼你會簽署一些包括資金的東西嗎？

President Trump: Sure. A separate thing, I would do it. But one of the reasons the Post Office needs that much money is they have all of these millions of ballots coming in from nowhere, and nobody knows from where and where they’re going. You saw what happened in Virginia. It was, you know, 500,000 applications coming in, going all over the state; nobody even knows where they came from. You saw what happened in New York, which was a disaster with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. And you see Paterson, New Jersey, what’s going on there. And we can give you many other locations and sites.

川普總統：當然可以。一個單獨的事情，我會做。但是，郵政局需要這麼多錢的原因之一是，他們有這些不知從哪裡來的數以百萬計的選票。你看到維吉尼亞發生的事了，如你所知，這是50萬申請被送來，走遍了整個州;沒人知道他們從哪裡來的。你看到紐約發生的事情，與女議員卡洛琳馬婁尼，這是一場災難。你看看新澤西州的派特森，那裡發生了什麼。我們可以為你提供許多其他地點和場所。

What has happened is that’s actually a small part of a big negotiation to get more money to people that it wasn’t their fault; it was China’s fault. And Post Office is part of it. Another part of it is they want $3.5 billion just for the ballots themselves. Why it’s so much, I don’t know. But that’s what the Democrats want.

已經發生的事情是，這其實是一個大談判中的一個小部分，讓人們得到更多的錢，這不是他們的錯，是中國的錯。而郵政局是其中的一部分。另一部分是他們要35億美金，只是為了選票本身。為什麼這麼多，我不知道。但這就是民主黨人想要的。

But if the bill isn’t going to get done, that would mean the Post Office isn’t going to get funded, and that would also mean that the three and a half billion dollars isn’t going to be taken care of. So I don’t know how you can possibly use these ballots, these mail-in ballots.

但如果這項法案不能完成，那將意味著郵局得不到資金，那也意味著35億美元不會得到處理。所以我不知道你怎麼可能使用這些選票，這些郵寄選票。

Absentee ballots, by the way, are fine. But the universal mail-ins that are just sent all over the place, where people can grab them and grab stacks of them, and sign them and do whatever you want, that’s the thing we’re against.

順便說一下，缺席選票沒問題。但那些被發送的普遍郵寄選票到處都是，它們可以被人們可以拿走，整堆地拿走，並簽署他們，人們可以為所欲為，這就是我們反對的東西。

Q: But isn’t that precisely the problem — is that you’re saying you do not want to give this Post Office funding in this Coronavirus legislation? They say they need it so they can be prepared; so if the pandemic is still going on in November when the election happens and people don’t feel safe to go vote in person, they can vote by mail, and it can be safe and it can be secure.

問：但這不是問題所在嗎？你的意思是說，你不想在這次冠狀病毒立法中給這個郵局撥款？郵局說他們需要它，這樣他們才能做好準備寄送;因此，如果疫情在11月選舉時仍在流行，而人們感到無法放心親自去投票，他們可以通過郵寄投票，而且這樣安全，也可以有保障。

President Trump: I can understand the Post Office. And if we could agree to a bill — the overall bill, which is obviously a much bigger number than just the Post Office — that would be fine. But they have the Post Office as one of their requests.

川普總統：我能理解郵局。如果我們能達成一項法案——整個法案的數字，顯然比郵局要的大得多——那部分好辦。但他們把郵政局作為他們的要求之一。

Q: But this morning you said you were against it, didn’t you?

問：但是今天早上你說你反對，不是嗎？

President Trump: What I’m against is I’m against doing anything where the people aren’t taken care of, and the people aren’t being taken care of properly. We want people to get money. It wasn’t their fault that they got shut down. They got shut down by China.

川普總統：我反對的是任何人民沒有得到適當照顧的事情。人民沒有得到適當的照顧，他們被停擺不是他們的錯，他們是被中國停擺了。

So whether it’s the Post Office or whether it’s the three and a half billion dollars — you know, they’re asking for three and a half billion dollars just for the universal mail-in ballots, but they’re not willing to make a deal. These are two points within a very big deal.

因此，無論是郵局還是35億美元——你知道的，他們要求35億美元，只是為了普遍郵寄選票，但他們不願意達成協議。這是這件大事中的兩點。

The thing they want more than anything else, is bailout money for the states and for the cities that are in trouble, which, for the most part, are Democrat-run states and cities. So New York has a problem, California has a problem, Illinois has a tremendous problem, and others. They want to be able to bail out these states, and we don’t want to be doing that, or certainly don’t want to do it to the extent. They’re looking for $1 trillion; we don’t want to be doing that.

他們最想要的，是為各州和陷入困境的城市提供救助資金，而大部分都是民主黨經營的州和城市。紐約有問題，加州有問題，伊利諾州有大問題，等等。他們希望能夠拯救紓困這些州，而我們不想這樣做，或者肯定在某種程度上不想做。他們正在索要1萬億美元; 我們不想這麼做。

Q: I’m just really confused, because this morning you said they need that money in order to make the Post Office work so it can take all these millions and millions of ballots, and you said that would be “fraudulent.” So it sounded like you said you’re blocking —

問：我真的很困惑，因為今天早上你說他們需要這筆錢，以便使郵局運作，這樣它才可以處理那百萬張選票，你說這將是“欺詐”。聽起來好像你說你在阻攔——

President Trump: No, no. No, no. I said it will end up being fraudulent, because if you look at what’s happened over the last few weeks — just look at the few instances where this has happened — it’s turned out to be fraudulent.

川普總統：不，不。不，不，我說這最終會是欺詐性的，因為如果你看看過去幾周發生的事情——只要看看發生這種事的少數例子——結果就是欺詐。

Q: There’s no widespread evidence of fraud, though.

問：不過，沒有廣泛的欺詐證據。

President Trump: Well, if you look at New York, it was fraudulent; if you look at Paterson, New Jersey, it was fraudulent. Of course there is. The whole thing is a mess. In fact, Carolyn Maloney’s opponent is — he’s gone crazed. He said they took the election away from him, and he may be right. I think they should redo that election.

川普總統：嗯，如果你看看紐約，這是欺詐性的;如果你看看新澤西州的派特森，那是欺詐性的。當然有。整件事都一團糟。事實上，卡洛琳·馬婁尼的對手是——他瘋了。他說他們搶走了他的選舉，他也許是對的。我認為他們應該重新選舉。

And if you look at Virginia, it’s terrible. Look at some of the things that have happened in California, where they found a million non-eligible voters. That was done by Tom Fitton and Judicial Watch.

如果你看看維吉尼亞，太可怕了。看看加利福尼亞發生的一些事情，在那裡他們找出了一百萬無資格投票者。這是由湯姆·菲頓和司法觀察完成的。

We have to have an honest election. And if it’s not going to be an honest election, I guess people have to sit down and think really long and hard about it.

我們必須進行誠實的選舉。如果這不是一場誠實的選舉，我想大家要坐下來好好地想一想了。

But if they’re not going to approve a bill and the Post Office, therefore, won’t have the money, and if they’re not going to approve a bigger bill, and they’re not going to have the three and a half billion dollars for the universal mail-in votes, how can you have those votes?

但是，如果他們不批准一項法案，郵政局將沒有錢，如果他們不批准整個更大的法案，他們就不會有35億美元來寄送普遍郵寄選票，怎麼可能會有這些選票？

What would mean is the people will have to go to the polls and vote, like the old days — like two years ago, three years ago, four years ago.

這意味著，人們將不得不像兩年前、三年前、四年前一樣，去現場投票。

They have to go to the — it doesn’t say anybody is taking the vote away, but it means that the universal mail-ins don’t work. Absentees do work. An absentee is a very different thing, where you make an application and you send it in, they send you a vote. It’s different.

沒有任何人說要奪走選票，但這意味著普遍的郵寄選票是行不通的。缺席票確實有效。這缺席票是非常不同的，你提出申請，然後你把它寄過去，他們會給你寄一張選票。這是不同的。

But I’m not saying anything wrong with voting. I want them to vote. But that would mean that they’d have to go to a voting booth, like they used to, and vote.

但我不是說投票有什麼不對。我希望他們投票。但這意味著他們必須像以前那樣去投票站投票。

Q: Even if they don’t feel safe voting in person? People want to vote by mail because of the pandemic.

問：即使他們覺得親自投票不安全？因為疫情的原因人們想通過郵遞投票。

President Trump: Well, they’re going to have to feel safe, and they will be safe, and we will make sure that they’re safe. And we’re not going to have to spend three and a half billion dollars to do it.

川普總統：他們必須感到安全，他們將是安全的，我們將確保他們是安全的。我們不必花35億美元來確保此事。

And when you go to a voting — it would be wonderful if we had voting ID. And some states have that, and some states don’t because they can’t get it passed. Most states want it. But we want people to vote so when they vote, it means one vote; it doesn’t mean ballots all over the place.

當你去投票時，如果我們有投票ID，那真是太棒了。有些州有，有些州沒有，因為他們不能通過它。大多數州都想要它。但是我們希望人們投票，所以當他們投票時，這意味著一人一票，這並不意味著選票遍地都是。

You saw what would — what was happening in Virginia, where piles of ballot applications are dropped all over the state. They had them named after dogs, dead people. We want to have an accurate vote. I’m not doing this for any reason. Maybe the other turns out to be my advantage, I don’t know. I can’t tell you that.

你看到了什麼——維吉尼亞發生的事情，那裡到處是成堆的選票申請。它們上面有阿貓阿狗的名字，有死人的名字。我們都希望有一個準確的投票。我不會因為任何原因這麼做。也許這本來是對我有利的，我並不知道。我沒法告訴你。

But I do know this: I just want an accurate vote and so does everybody else.

但我知道這一點：我只想有一個準確的投票，其他人也一樣。

Q: Mr. President, how does the accord today between Israel and the UAE help struggling and persecuted Christians in the Middle East? How does it help struggling and persecuted Christians in the Middle East — the deal today?

問：總統先生，以色列和阿聯酋達成一致的協議今天如何説明在中東掙扎和遭迫害的基督徒？

President Trump: Well, I think it’s going to. I think it’s a big start. And you’re right about that: Christians have been persecuted by some countries in particular in the Middle East. And I think this is going to be a very strong start, and it’s something that I will tell you — I’ve told David, I’ve told every one of our negotiators: If you look at the way Christians have been treated in some countries, in the Middle East, it’s beyond disgraceful. If I had information and if I had absolute proof — some of the stories that we’ve heard, which is not easy to get — I would go in and do a number to those countries like you wouldn’t believe.

川普總統：我想會的。我認為這是一個很大的開始。你說得對。基督徒受到一些國家的迫害，特別是在中東。我認為這將是一個非常強大的開始，我要告訴你——我已經告訴大衛，我已經告訴了每一個談判者：如果你看看基督徒在一些國家和中東受到的待遇，比可恥還過份。如果我有情報，如果我有絕對的證據——我們聽過的一些故事，這並不容易得到——我會過去把他們打得落花流水，超乎你的想像。

It’s a very big part of the overall negotiation. And as countries come in — for instance, UAE has agreed very strongly to represent us; I think they will very well with respect to Christianity, because in the Middle East, it’s not treated well. It’s not treated well at all. It’s treated horribly and very unfairly, and it’s criminal what’s happened — and that’s for many, many years.

這是整個談判的一個非常大的部分。例如，隨著各國的進入，阿聯酋非常堅定地同意代表我們;我認為他們對基督教很好，因為在中東，它受到的待遇一點都不好。它受到可怕的和非常不公平的對待，這是傷天害理的事情，而這持續了很多很多年。

Q: Larry Kudlow said that there’s a routine check-in call with China on the phase one trade deal. What if they bring up TikTok and also WeChat? Would you instruct your team to engage them on that executive order you just signed?

問：拉裡·庫德洛說，在第一階段貿易協定中，有一個例行的進展通報電話。如果他們提出抖音和微信呢？您會不會指示你的團隊讓他們參與您剛剛簽署的行政命令？

President Trump: No, we have a deadline of September 15th. And whether it’s Microsoft, I understand — and others are negotiating — we also said that, obviously, it’s worthless if we don’t allow them into the country, so we said that the United States Treasury is going to be getting something very substantial out of this deal.

川普總統：不，9月15日是最後期限。據我理解無論是微軟，還是其他正在談判的人，我們也對他們說過，顯然，如果我們不讓他們入境，那將分文不值，所以我們說，美國財政部將從這筆交易中得到一些非常實質性的東西。

But what we want is total security, but we have a deadline of September 15th. So I know Microsoft and others are very interested in it, but that’s our deadline. And it has to be proven to be totally secure. We don’t want to have any information going into China with what we’ve been through.

但我們想要的是完全的安全保障，我們有9月15日作為最後期限。所以我知道微軟和其他公司對此很感興趣，但那是我們的最後期限。而且必須證明它是完全安全的。我們不想有任何資訊流入中國，我們已經經歷了這麼多。

Well, the phase one deal, it’s a very interesting situation because you’ve been hearing, “the largest order of corn in history,” “the largest order of soybeans,” “the largest order of beef.” They’ve done more than they’ve ever done.

第一階段的貿易協定，這是一個非常有趣的情況，你一直聽到的，“歷史上最大的玉米訂單”，“最大的大豆訂單”，“最大的牛肉訂單”。他們所做的是前所未有的。

So you’re going to have to figure that one out. Because they see my attitude. My attitude toward China is not friendly. But they have gone into orders that are extremely large, and our farmers are very happy.

所以，你必須弄清楚這個。因為他們看到了我的態度。我對中國的態度是不友好的。但他們已經進了非常大的訂單，我們的農民非常高興。

But with what they did with respect to the pandemic, the plague that came in from China, it just is a different feeling. It’s an incredible deal, but I have a very different feeling.

對於這場來自中國的瘟疫，他們的所作所為，卻是一種不同的感覺。這是一個令人難以置信的交易，但令我有種非常不同的感覺。

But they are giving the Midwest, our farmers, among the largest orders they’ve ever seen. Somebody told me today — Bob Lighthizer said about 40 percent of what they’re selling now is going to China. So maybe they’re trying to make me change my mind a little bit, because you know my attitude on China, and it hasn’t been very good.

但他們正在給予給中西部，我們的農民，他們見過最大的訂單之一。今天有人告訴我——鮑勃·萊特希澤說，他們現在銷售的東西中，有40%是去中國。也許他們試圖讓我稍微改變主意，因為你也知道我對中國的態度，一直都不是很好。

Q: But you’re willing to (inaudible) TikTok with them in these negotiations?

問：你願意在這些談判中與他們（談）TikTok嗎？

President Trump: Well, we’re not talking to them. No, we’re talking to the companies. In theory, it’s a company, but it’s a company within China. That means China. And the deal will have to be substantially beneficial to the United States, and we need total security.

川普總統：嗯，我們不是在和他們對話。不，我們的確正在和那些公司談判。從理論上講，它是一家公司，但它是一家在中國的公司。這就等於中國本身。而且這筆交易必須對美國有實質性的好處，我們需要全面的安全保障。

Q: Mr. President, can you say whether you yourself think that annexation should be off the table for Israel? And if so, have you communicated that to the Prime Minister?

問：總統先生，您能否表示自己認為以色列不應該進行吞併？如果是的話，您是否向總理傳達了這一點？

President Trump: Well, not off the table. No. It’s something they’ve discussed, but Israel has agreed not to do that. I mean, more than just off the table, they have agreed not to do it. And I think that was very important, and I think it was a great concession by Israel, and I think it was a very smart concession by Israel.

川普總統：這個選項並沒有離開談判桌。不。這是他們討論過的事情，但以色列已經同意不這麼做。我的意思是，他們不僅同意把它從談判桌上移除，還同意了不這麼做。我認為這是非常重要的，我認為這是以色列的一個巨大的讓步，非常明智的讓步。

Q: The Prime Minister was pretty clear today at his own press conference that he considers this to be a temporary suspension and that the deal would still be open to him at some point in the future. I’m asking what you think he should do?

問：首相今天在自己的記者招待會上非常明確地表示，他認為這是暫時性的中止，在未來這項協議仍將對他開放。我在問你認為他應該怎麼做？

President Trump: No, right now, all I can say: It’s off the table. So I can’t talk about some time into the future; that’s a big statement. But right now it’s off the table. Is that a correct statement, Mr. Ambassador?

川普總統：不，現在我只能說這個選項已從談判桌上移除。所以我不能斷言未來一段時間;這是一個很大的聲明。但現在選項已從談判桌上移除。是這聲明沒錯吧，大使先生？

Ambassador Friedman: Yes. The word “suspend” was chosen carefully by all the parties. “Suspend,” by definition that means “temporary halt.” It’s off the table now, but it’s not off the table permanently.

弗裡德曼大使：是的。“暫停”一詞是各方的精心選擇的。“暫停”，根據字面定義，這意味著“暫時停止”。它現在已不在談判桌上，但它不是永久離開談判桌。

Q: Mr. President, you said you do want an accurate vote. Would you direct the Postmaster General to reverse some of the policies changes that have occurred there, in order to prevent delays?

問：總統先生，您說確實想要一個準確的投票。您會指示郵政局長扭轉那裡發生的一些政策變化，以防止延誤大選嗎？

President Trump: No, I wouldn’t do that at all. No, I want the Post Office to run properly. Which makes sense, they would need a lot more money if they’re going to be taking in tens of millions of ballots that just come out of the sky from nowhere. And so they need additional financial help.

川普總統：不，我根本不會這樣做的。不，我想讓郵局正常運轉。這是有道理的，如果他們要處理數以千萬計從天而降的選票，他們需要更多的錢，額外的經濟幫助。

It’s a part of the bill that the Democrats don’t want to make because they want much bigger part of the bill — a trillion dollars to go to states that are run by Democrats governors, who have not done a good job for many, many years. And those are states that owe a lot of money and need a lot of money, and they’re talking about $1 trillion.

這一部分法案是民主黨不想做的，因為他們想要法案中更大的一部分，1萬億美元交給由民主黨州長管理的這些州，而他們很多很多年來都做得不夠好。這些州欠了很多錢，需要很多錢，他們說的是1萬億美元。

So, the Post Office and the three and a half billion dollars for the votes themselves, which sounds like a lot of money they’re looking for. Think of that: three and a half billion to have mail-in ballots.

所以，郵局和35億美元用於選票本身，這聽起來像是他們正在索要很大的一筆錢。想想吧：三十五億用於郵寄選票。

Again — absentee, good; universal mail-in, very bad.

再次重申一遍，缺席票，是好的; 普遍郵寄，非常糟糕。

Q: Given that the negotiations are still ongoing about whether to get more money to the Postal Service, why not put more resources and more money, yourself?

問：鑒於是否向郵政局提供更多資金的談判仍在進行中，您為什麼不自己投入更多的資源和更多的資金？

President Trump: Well, they can do it very easily. All they have to do is make a deal. If they make a deal, the Postal Service is taken care of, the money they need for the mail-in ballots would be taken care of — if we agree to it. That doesn’t mean we’re going to agree to it. But all they have to do is make a deal.

川普總統：嗯，他們很容易做到。他們要做的只是達成協議而已。如果他們達成協議，郵政局就會得到顧及，如果我們同意的話，他們郵寄選票所需的資金就會得到處置。這並不意味著我們會同意。但他們必須做的就是達成協議。

But again, more important to them is not that. That’s a lot of money, but a small time compared to the other. What they want to do very very strongly is bail out cities that are run by Democrats for many years. And these cities and states have done very badly, and they desperately need money for that.

但對他們來說，更重要的並不是這些。這是一大筆錢，但與其他款項相比卻不算什麼。他們非常非常想做的是救助那些由民主黨人經營多年的城市。這些城市和州做得非常糟糕，他們迫切需要資金。

And we’re open to something, but we’re not open to the kind of money that they need.

而我們對一些事情持開放態度，但我們對他們需要的那種錢並不開放。

Q: What are you doing, as President, to make sure there is a free and fair election?

問：作為總統，你正在做些什麼，以確保有一個自由和公平的選舉？

President Trump: So, everyone talks about “Russia, Russia, Russia.” They talk about “China, China.” They talk about all of these different countries that come in and run our elections, which is false.

川普總統：人人都在說“俄羅斯，俄羅斯，俄羅斯”。他們說“中國，中國”。他們談論所有這些不同的國家來插手我們的選舉，這是錯誤的。

But what they don’t talk about are things like very loose mail-in ballots, universal in nature, that, frankly, Russia, China, North Korea, Iran — all of these countries that we are reading about, hearing about, and, in some cases, they’re writing about, intelligence-wise — these countries can grab those ballots or print forgeries of those ballots, and they would go out and they would have a field day.

但是，他們不談論的是非常鬆散的郵寄選票，具有普遍性，坦率地說，俄羅斯、中國、朝鮮、伊朗——所有這些我們正在讀到、聽到、在某些情況下，他們正在編寫相關內容的國家，從情報上講——這些國家可以奪走這些選票，偽造選票，他們會出來各顯身手。

The mail-in ballots is the easiest way for a country like a China or Russia or a North Korea or Iran — I hear Iran, too. You know, that was part of the report. This would be very easy for them.

對於像中國、俄羅斯、朝鮮或伊朗這樣的國家來說，郵寄選票是最簡單的方法——我也聽說過伊朗，如你所知，那是報導的一部分。這對他們來說非常容易。

Well, we have been very strong. Now, if you remember, President Obama was informed about Russia by the FBI in September. The election was in November. President Obama decided to do absolutely nothing about it. People don’t mention that very much anymore. That’s a lost fact. But he was informed very powerfully that they’re going to do — and President Obama did nothing. We have done a lot, and we’ve really shored it up.

我們一直非常強勢。現在，如果你還記得，奧巴馬總統在9月被FBI告知俄羅斯的情況。選舉是在11月。奧巴馬總統決定完全不採取任何行動。人們不再怎麼提起了，這是一個被遺忘的事實。但他被非常有力地告知了他們要幹什麼，而奧巴馬總統什麼也沒做。我們做了很多工作，我們真的把它撐起來了。

But what people can never prepare for are millions and millions of mail-in ballots. Because they can be forged. They can be captured. They can be taken.

但人們永遠無法做好應對數百萬張郵寄選票的準備。因為它們可以被偽造。它們可以被截獲。它們可以被奪走。

Q: I wanted to ask about the payroll tax cut. Is it going to be optional or mandatory for employers to defer and not collect the payroll tax?

問：我想問一下工資稅的減免。雇主延期繳納和不徵收工資稅是選擇性的還是強制性的？

President Trump: The payroll tax is very important and a very big benefit to people and companies, because we want the companies to be strong — but now, directly to people. And it’s a very big number. And we’re taking care of it. And this will go directly to the people, to workers within the company. It’s a payroll tax. It’s called a payroll tax cut. We’re cutting the payroll tax.

川普總統：工資稅非常重要，對人們，對公司來說也是一大好處，因為我們希望公司強大起來——但現在，將直接對人們有利。這是一個非常大的數字。我們正在處理它。而這將直接去到人們，去到公司員工手裡。這就是所謂的工資稅減免。我們正在削減工資稅。

Q: But will the employers collect that through FICA? Are they going to be required not to collect that money?

問：但雇主會通過聯邦保險捐助條例稅（FICA）來收集嗎？會要求他們不收那筆錢嗎？

President Trump: The employers will collect it and give it, most likely.

川普總統：最有可能的是，雇主會收集它，並提交它。

Q: There are claims circulating on social media that Kamala Harris is not eligible to run for Vice President because she was an “anchor baby,” I quote. She was born in this country, but the claims say that her parents did not receive their permanent residence at that time. Do you or can you definitively say whether or not Kamala Harris is eligible and meets the legal requirements to run as Vice President?

問：有人在社交媒體上流傳，卡馬拉·哈裡斯沒有資格競選副總統，我引用一下，因為她是一個“落戶寶寶”。她出生在這個國家，但據聲稱她的父母當時沒有獲得永久居留權。您能否明確地說，卡馬拉·哈裡斯是否有資格，是否符合競選副總統的法律要求？

President Trump: So, I just heard it today that she doesn’t meet the requirements. And, by the way, the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer. I have no idea if that’s right. I would’ve assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for Vice President. Yeah, I don’t know about it. I just heard about it. I’ll take a look.

川普總統：我也是今天剛聽說她不符合要求。順便說一下，寫那篇文章的律師是一位非常高素質、非常有才華的律師。但我不知道那是否正確。我以為民主黨會在她被選為副總統之前就查清楚了呢。是的，我並不知道。我剛聽說，我會去看看的。

Q: Mr. President, a follow-up on UNGA. Ambassador Kelly Craft recently said hoping that you might be able to deliver the speech in front of the U.N. General Assembly in person, even though other leaders will be sending in their video recordings. Can you confirm that?

問：總統先生，聯合國大會（UNGA）問題的跟進。凱利·克拉夫特大使最近說希望您能夠親自在聯合國大會上發表演講，即使其他領導人只會發送他們的視頻。你能確認一下這一點嗎？

President Trump: Yeah, I’m thinking about going directly to the U.N. to do the speech. A lot of people will not be able to be there, because of COVID. But I think it’s appropriate. If we can do it, I’ll do it directly. And again, this will not be like in the past because some countries won’t be able to escape the problems they’re having. You know, countries are having a tremendous problem with the China virus. So, we’ll see what happens.

川普總統：是的，我正在考慮直接去聯合國做演講。因為新冠的緣故，很多人都不能到場。但我認為這是合適的。如果我們可以做到，我會親自到場。同樣，這不會像過去那樣，因為某些國家將無法逃避他們所面臨的問題。你知道，各國在中國病毒上都有著巨大的問題。所以，讓我們拭目以待吧。

But I would prefer doing it. I can do it the other way. I can do it “viral,” as they say. I can do it in that form. But I’d rather be at the United Nations — deliver it.

但我寧願這樣做。我可以用另一種方式。我可以像他們說的“網紅”做法。我可以以這種形式做。但我寧願親自在聯合國完成演講。

I think it better represents the country. Also, I feel, sort of, a — at least a semi-obligation as the President of the United States to be at the United Nations to deliver what will be an important speech.

我認為這能更好地代表國家。此外，我覺得，作為美國總統，某種程度有一半的義務到聯合國發表重要講話。

Q: Would you still do it if the room was empty?

問：如果房間空無一人，你還會這麼做嗎？

President Trump: Well, the room won’t be empty. The room will have different people there and representatives of countries. But I can understand how it’s very difficult for countries to be there. They won’t be there only for that reason. They’d love to be there. I’ve already had people call, say “I’d love to be there. If you want, I’ll be there.” I said, “Don’t be there. You don’t have to be there.”

川普總統：嗯，房間不會是空的。房間裡將有不同的人，還有各國的代表。但我能理解為什麼這些國家很難在那裡出面。他們不會只因為這個原因才去那裡的。他們很想到場。已經有人打電話給我了，說“我很樂意到場。如果你想，我會去的”。我說，“別去，你不一定要去那裡”。

Although, there may be a spacing requirement like you have in this room. This room was always packed. This room would be packed again if we had the seats open. But you have a spacing requirement, so I understand that the United Nations, they may have that, too.

不過，可能會有間距要求，就如這個房間一樣。這個房間總是擠滿了人。如果我們把座位開放，這個房間就會再次被擠滿。但你們有一個間距要求，所以我理解聯合國，他們可能也有。

Q: I would like to ask your opinion about the recent attack on press freedom in Hong Kong. And Jimmy Lai was arrested; his newsroom was raided. How will the U.S. respond to this?

**問：我想問一下你對最近香港新聞自由受到攻擊的看法。黎智英遭逮捕，他的新聞編輯室被突擊搜查。美國對此將如何回應？**

President Trump: Well, I think it’s a terrible thing. But one thing that we have done — you know, we gave tremendous incentives to Hong Kong because of freedom. We want freedom. And we were giving tremendous economic incentives to Hong Kong. And we have now withdrawn all of those incentives, and it will be impossible for Hong Kong to compete with the United States with respect to that. It just won’t be, because we’ve taken all of the incentives away.

**川普總統：嗯，我認為這是一件可怕的事情。但有一件事，我們曾經做的——如你所知，我們給予香港巨大的激勵是因為自由。我們要自由。我們給予香港巨大的經濟激勵。而我們現已撤銷所有這些激勵措施，香港不可能在這方面再與美國競爭。不會的，因為我們已經撤銷了所有的激勵措施。**

If you look at China — with the World Trade Organization, as an example — they’re getting tremendous because they’re considered a developing nation, which is ridiculous. Why should they be a developing nation, but we’re not? And they get tremendous incentives.

**以世界貿易組織（WTO）為例，中國之所以變成龐然大物，是因為它們被認為是一個發展中國家，這太荒謬了。為什麼他們是一個發展中國家，而我們不是？他們得到了巨大的激勵。**

By the way, I told them it’s unacceptable, and we’ve been doing that for a long time. They understand exactly how we feel, and big changes are being made. But with respect to Hong Kong, they get tremendous financial incentives so that they could do business and compete in the world.

**順便說一下，我告訴他們這是不能接受的，我們已經這樣做了很久了。他們完全明白我們的感受，並且正在做出巨大的改變。但就香港來說，他們得到了巨大的經濟激勵，使他們能夠在世界範圍內開展業務和競爭。**

We’ve now withdrawn all of those incentives. It’s going to be very hard for Hong Kong to compete. And I will tell you that the United States — and I say this from any standpoint you want to hear it — will end up making a lot more money because of it. Because we lost a lot of business to Hong Kong. We made it very convenient for people to go there, for companies to go there. We’ve withdrawn all of that. And the United States will be a big beneficiary from an economic standpoint, but I hate to see what happened to Hong Kong because freedom is a great thing.

**我們現在已經撤銷了所有這些激勵措施。香港要競爭會很難。我要告訴你，美國——無論你想從哪個角度看——最終都會因此賺更多的錢。因為我們在香港失去了很多生意。我們曾讓人們、讓公司非常方便地去那裡。我們已經撤回了這一切。從經濟角度來看，美國將會是一個很大的受益者，但我也不願意看到香港發生的事情，因為自由是一件偉大的事情。**
