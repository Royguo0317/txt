## 白宮新聞秘書凱裡·麥肯尼的新聞發佈會（7/21）
`2020-07-22 11:24 GM31` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hant/272569/)

[凱莉·麥肯尼於2020年7月21日舉行新聞發佈會](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u9iErt7iuk&amp;t=353s)，她在會上表示波特蘭的暴力、混亂和無政府狀態是不可接受的，並回答了有關聯邦資源增援及其合法性、聯邦資金有關支助和減薪稅的問題，以及對新冠的集合測試和其他對策。



11:16 A.M. EDT

美國東部時間上午11:16

MS. MCENANY: Good morning, everyone. By any objective standard, the violence, chaos, and anarchy in Portland is unacceptable, yet Democrats continue to put politics above peace while this President seeks to restore law and order.

麥肯尼女士：大家早上好。以任何客觀標準，波特蘭的暴力、混亂和無政府狀態都是不能接受的，當我們的總統尋求恢復法律和秩序，然而民主黨繼續把政治置於和平之上。

Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat — Governor of Oregon — said that the President should, quote, “stop playing politics,” called law enforcement officers “secret police,” and likened it to, quote, a “dictatorship.” The governor also called on the president to get his officers off the streets.

俄勒岡州州長、民主黨人凱特·布朗（Kate Brown）表示，總統應該“停止玩弄政治”，稱執法人員為“秘密員警”，並稱其為“獨裁”。州長還呼籲總統從街道上遣散他的軍官。

Democrat mayor of Portland, Todd Wheeler, said the President is “trying to look strong for his base” while you had Democrats on the Hill, Nancy Pelosi, calling these officers stormtroopers and Jim Clyburn calling them the Gestapo.

波特蘭市市長，民主黨人陶德·惠勒（Todd Wheeler）說，總統“打腫臉充胖子”，同時在國會山的民主黨人，南茜佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi），稱這些軍官帝國風暴兵和吉姆克萊本稱他們為蓋世太保。

This rhetoric is unhelpful and gives the violence we have seen a pass. But President Trump will not give the violence a pass. He will restore order where the Democrat governor and the Democrat mayor are unwilling to admit that they have lost control of their city.

這種言論是無益的，給我們所看到的暴力提供了一種許可。但川普總統不會對暴力事件放任不管。儘管民主黨州長和民主黨市長不願意承認他們已經失去了對城市的控制，他還是會恢復秩序。

The well-organized mob in Portland has become increasingly aggressive, especially against law enforcement officers. Individuals have thrown bricks, chunks of concrete, glass bottles, feces, balloons filled with paint, pig’s feet, slingshots to hurl ball bearings and batteries at federal agents and the courthouse.

波特蘭組織嚴密的暴徒們越來越咄咄逼人，尤其是針對執法人員。個別人士用磚塊、混凝土塊、玻璃瓶、糞便、裝滿油漆的氣球、豬腳，用彈弓投射軸承和電池投擲向聯邦人員和法院建築。

Multiple attempts to barricade officers in the Hatfield Courthouse have occurred; attempts to start the structure on fire as well. Use of eyesight-damaging laser devices have been used, and strobe lights against federal agents as well. But according to Speaker Pelosi, when asked about the violent removal of statues, “people will do what they do.”

多次企圖在哈特菲爾德法院設置路障；還多次試圖點燃該建築。使用損害視力的鐳射設備，以及針對聯邦人員的頻閃燈。但根據議長佩洛西，當被問及暴力拆除雕像的問題時，“人們會做他們要做的事”。

The Trump administration urges state and local officials to work cooperatively to restore law and order. Operation LeGend is a great example of this. At the governor’s request, we went into Kansas City and surged the area with federal assets — FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Marshals. This was named after LeGend Taliferro, a 4-year-old young boy who lost his life and was shot in his bed tragically.

川普政府敦促州和地方官員合作恢復法律和秩序。勒根德行動（LeGend）就是一個很好的例子。應州長的要求，我們進入坎薩斯城，利用聯邦資源——聯邦調查局（FBI）、緝毒局（DEA）、煙酒槍械局（ATF）和美國法警——對該地區進行了突擊。這是以勒根德·塔利費羅（LeGend Taliferro）的名字命名的，他是一個不幸喪命4歲的小男孩，在床上被悲慘地槍殺。

This has been a successful operation that has been waged in his name, including the arrest of wanted fugitives. Similarly, President Trump is taking action in Portland, even though you have a Democrat mayor and Democrat governor unwilling to work with us in this situation. We are surging resources, along with Secretary Wolf at DHS, and augmenting the Federal Protective Service to safeguard federal property.

這是一次以他的名義進行的成功行動，包括逮捕通緝逃犯。同樣，川普總統正在波特蘭採取行動，即使那裡的民主黨市長和民主黨州長在這種情況下也不願意與我們合作。我們正在與國土安全部（DHS）的沃爾夫（Wolf）部長一起調集資源，並加強聯邦保護局的力量，以保護聯邦財產。

The bottom line is that this President stands with law and order, which leads to peace. And we will not allow Portland to become the new CHOP, like what we saw in Seattle.

底線是，這位總統與法律和秩序站在一起，這將帶來和平。我們不會允許波特蘭成為新的國會山自治區（CHOP），就如我們在西雅圖看到的那樣。

And with that, I’ll take questions.

以下，我將接受提問。

Jon.

喬恩。

Q: Kayleigh, two questions on Portland. One, the case of Navy veteran Christopher David, who went down because he said he wanted to talk to the law enforcement officers and ask them about the oath of office that they took. He was — as people saw on videotape, he was beaten with a baton. He had pepper spray sprayed on his face. He now has two broken bones in his hand. Is the President aware of what happened to this Navy veteran graduate of the Naval Academy? And does he condone that kind of action by these law enforcement officers?

問：凱莉，兩個關於波特蘭的問題。一是海軍老兵克里斯多夫·大衛（Christopher David）一案，他說因為他想和執法人員談談，並叩問他們的就職誓詞所以參與了遊行。正如人們在視頻上看到的，他被人用警棍毆打。他臉上被噴了胡椒噴霧。現在他的手有兩處骨折。總統知道這位海軍學院畢業的退伍軍人的遭遇嗎？他是否容忍這些執法人員的這種行為？

MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I’m aware of the details of that situation. I haven’t heard the audio of the video, though I’ve seen it. And I’d refer you to DHS about the extenuating details. We always encourage the appropriate use of force, and we always also encourage those in the area to remain peaceful towards our law enforcement officers.

答：是的，我知道那一事件的細節。雖然沒聽過視頻的音訊，但我已經看過。我想請你向國土安全部瞭解更多內情和細節。我們一向鼓勵適度使用武力，我們也總是鼓勵該地區的人保持對執法人員的和平態度。

Q: And my second question is: Where in the Constitution does the President derive the authority to send federal law enforcement officers to the streets of American cities against the will of the elected officials in those cities?

問：我的第二個問題是：憲法中哪來的權力讓總統違背美國城市民選官員的意願，派遣聯邦執法人員上這些城市的街頭？

MS. MCENANY: Yes, well, what you’re referring to is Portland. And 40 U.S. Code 1315 gives DHS the ability to deputize officers in any department or agency, like ICE, Customs and Border Patrol, and Secret Service. Quote, “As officers and agents,” they can be deputized for the duty of — “in connection with the protection of property owned or occupied by the federal government and persons on that property.” And when a federal courthouse is being lit on fire, commercial fireworks being shot at it, being shot at the officers, I think that that falls pretty well within the limits of 40 U.S. Code 1315.

答：是的，你指的是波特蘭。而《美國法典》第40章第1315條規定，國土安全部可以在任何部門或機構，如移民局、海關和邊境巡邏隊、特勤局等部門或機構中派駐人員。引用：“作為官員和代理人”，他們可被委派執行“保護聯邦政府擁有或佔用的財產和該財產上的人員” 有關的職責。而當聯邦法院大樓被點燃，商業煙花被射向官員時，我認為這完全屬於《美國法典》第40章第1315條的範圍內。

Q: So that’s a matter of protecting federal property, like a federal courthouse, in the case of Portland. Does he see limitations to that power? How much — how far does that power extend into the streets of the city of Portland? How — you know, what — are their limitations on that —

問：所以這是一個保護聯邦財產的問題，比如波特蘭的聯邦法院大樓。他認為這種權力有限制嗎？這種權力在波特蘭市的街道上能延伸多大範圍？他們對——

MS. MCENANY: So, under the —

答：所以根據——

Q: — that authority to protect a federal property?

問：——這種保護聯邦財產的權力有什麼限制？

MS. MCENANY: Under the law, we believe that agents can conduct investigations of crimes committed against federal property or federal officers. And in the case where you have someone shooting off a commercial-grade firework and then running across the street, we don’t believe that that extends past our jurisdiction.

答：根據法律規定，我們認為特工可以對針對聯邦財產或聯邦官員的犯罪進行調查。對於有人發射了一個商業級的煙花，然後在街上橫行無忌的情況，我們認為這並沒有超出我們的管轄範圍。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: Kayleigh, thank you. Yesterday, the President tweeted out an image of himself wearing a mask. He said that wearing a mask is an act of patriotism; no one is more patriotic than him. Then, just hours later, he was spotted at the Trump Hotel not wearing a mask. Why did it take him so long, first of all, to be seen wearing a mask in public? And why the mixed messaging on this critical health issue that his own top health officials have said is critical to fighting this pandemic?

問：凱莉，謝謝。昨天，總統在推特上發佈了一張自己戴著面具的微博。他說戴口罩是一種愛國主義行為；沒有人比他更愛國。幾個小時後，他在川普酒店被發現沒有戴口罩。首先，為什麼他花了這麼長時間，才在公共場合戴面具？以及在這個他自己的高級衛生官員也說是對抗疫情至關重要的鍵健康問題上，做出矛盾的表示？

MS. MCENANY: The President has always been consistent on this: that masks, according to the CDC, are recommended but not required. He has said that he would wear one in the case he couldn’t appropriately socially distance. And he wore one and put up the picture on Twitter, as you saw.

答：總統在這方面一貫一致：根據疾病預防控制中心的說法，建議戴口罩，但不是必須的。他曾說過，在不能適當保持社交距離的情況下，他會戴上一個。而他也戴了一個，並把照片放到了在推特上，如你所見。

Q: Does he think that it’s important to lead by example on this issue?

問：他認為在這個問題上以身作則很重要嗎？

MS. MCENANY: Well, the President has led. He’s been consistent, even going back to March 31st, when he said then, “My feeling is, if people want to do it, there’s certainly no harm to it.”

答：嗯，總統一直在以身作則。他態度是一貫的，甚至可以追溯到3月31日，當時他說，“我的感覺是，如果人們想這麼做，肯定沒有壞處”。

Q: But he hasn’t done it, Kayleigh. He hasn’t worn a mask. And so it’s sending — is it not mixed signals?

問：但他沒有這樣做，凱莉。他沒戴面罩。所以，難道這發出的——不是矛盾的信號嗎？

THE PRESIDENT: The President wore a mask in May. The president wore a mask at Walter Reed, out of an abundance of caution. But as I’ve made clear from this podium, the President is the most tested man in America. He’s tested more than anyone, multiple times a day. And we believe that he’s acting appropriately.

答：總統在五月戴上了面罩。總統出於大量的謹慎，在沃爾特裡德戴了面罩。但正如我在這個講臺上明確表示過的，總統是美國最經檢測的人。他每天都做多次檢測，比任何人都多。我們相信他的行為是適當的。

Q: Let me ask you about the federal stimulus, if I might. Negotiations are ongoing. Why is the White House blocking Republicans’ requests for more funding for testing and contact tracing? Senator Roy Blunt saying, “It just doesn’t make sense. I think that’s just wrong.”

問：如果我可以的話，讓我問你關於聯邦經濟刺激計畫的問題。談判正在進行中。為什麼白宮攔截了共和黨派的請求，為檢測和接觸者追蹤提供更多資金？參議員羅伊·布倫特說：”這根本毫無道理。我認為那是錯的”。

MS. MCENANY: So, no one is blocking any money from testing. One of the things I would add is that this is an ongoing negotiation. We’re just in the early days of that. Currently, in federal coffers, we have $10 billion — that’s with a “B” — unspent, that is allocated for testing. And we want to ensure that in phase four there is money that is targeted for testing in the way that makes most sense.

答：所以，沒有人攔截任何用於檢測的資金。我要補充的一點就是，這是一個還在進行議論的，只是正在初期的計畫。目前，在聯邦財政中，我們有100億美元——那是個“億”——未使用，被分配用於檢測。我們希望確保在第四階段，資金以最合理的方式用於檢測。

Q: But Republican says they need that money. Is the President willing to come to the table (inaudible)?

問：但是共和黨派說他們需要這筆錢。總統願意就此來談判…？

MS. MCENANY: We’re willing to put in money for targeted testing that makes sense, not just dumping money into a pot that already contains $10 billion.

答：我們願意把錢投入到有意義的針對性檢測中，而不是把更多錢與已有100億堆在一起。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: Kayleigh, there’s very little support in Congress for a payroll tax cut, but the President keeps pushing for it. Why is that so important to him? How does a payroll tax cut help the 25 million Americans out of work when they’re not getting a paycheck?

問：凱利，國會中對減薪稅的支持率非常低，但總統一直在推動減薪稅。為什麼這對他如此重要？對2500萬失業的美國人來說，他們又拿不到工資，減薪稅如何幫助他們？

MS. MCENANY: Well, there are a number of things we’re looking at for phase four, and one of those things is unemployment benefits, where as Secretary Mnuchin said, we want this to be completed before July 31st, the date that that runs out. We don’t want something to be an incentive where someone gets overpaid and has a disincentive from going back to work, or they get paid more on unemployment benefits than at work. So we want to be cautious about that while making sure that those unemployed are taken care of.

答：嗯，我們正在研究第四階段的一些事情，其中之一是失業救濟金，正如姆努欽部長所說，我們希望在7月31日之前完成這項工作，即失業救濟金截止日期。我們不想讓激勵成為一種抑制因素，因為某人的工資過高，不願意回去工作，或者他們得到的失業救濟金比工作上的工資更多。因此，我們希望謹慎行事，同時確保這些失業者得到照顧。

But the payroll tax in particular goes to some of our hardest-working Americans. The people that it benefits, if you look at the tax structure, are middle-income and low-income workers. And not only that: There’s an incentive on the employer side with a payroll tax holiday that encourages them to hire more too because it reduces their burden. So it’s a very smart policy.

但工資稅的徵收物件是我們一些最勤勞的美國人。如果你看看稅收結構，（減薪稅）所惠及的人，是中等收入和低收入的工人。不僅如此，雇主方面也有一個激勵措施，通過工資稅假期鼓勵他們雇傭更多的員工，因為這會減少他們的負擔。因此這是一個非常明智的政策。

Q: But those are people who still have jobs. So wouldn’t it be more important to focus on the people who don’t, if you’re worried about the overall cost of this stimulus?

問：但這些人都是還有工作的人。所以，如果你擔心這次刺激措施的整體成本，那麼關注那些沒有工作的人不是更重要嗎？

MS. MCENANY: We can focus on a number of things at once, and part of that is a payroll tax for middle and income — low-income Americans who are out there working each and every day and making their way through as best they can. It also means unemployment benefits; it also means direct payments to Americans. So we’re looking at all of that, and we would like to see all of that.

答：我們可以同時關注許多事情，其中之一就是向中等收入和——低收入的美國人徵收的工資稅減免——他們每天都在工作，並盡最大努力度過難關。這也意味著失業救濟金也是其一；這也意味著對美國人的直接支助也是其一。因此，我們正在研究這一切，我們希望看到這一切實現。

Q: Just a second question on the briefing today at 5 o’clock: Should we expect to see members of the Coronavirus Task Force? Will Dr. Fauci, will Dr. Birx be there?

問：關於今天5點發佈會的第二個問題：我們會見到冠狀病毒專責小組成員嗎？福西博士（Fauci），伯克斯博士（Birx）會出席嗎？

MS. MCENANY: You’ll have to tune in to see.

答：你需要繼續等待最新變化。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: Thank you. On Portland — on sending agents to Portland, as well as plans for Chicago: Why are these the right people to send? It’s my understanding these agents often work on human smuggling, drug trafficking, things like that. Do they have the right skillset, whether it’s gun violence in Chicago or quelling unrest in Portland?

問：謝謝。關於波特蘭——關於向波特蘭派遣特工，以及關於芝加哥的計畫：為什麼要派這些人去？據我瞭解，這些特工經常從事處理人口走私、販毒的工作。他們是否有合適的技能，以處理無論是芝加哥的槍支暴力還是波特蘭的騷亂？

MS. MCENANY: Well, first let me add, they haven’t been sent to Chicago. These DHS officials are currently in Portland protecting a courthouse. We do believe they’re the right individuals for that, as does 40 U.S.C. 1315, the United States Code. It’s egregious what’s happening: the frequency jammers, the pellet and air rifles in Portland. It’s being depicted as this peaceful scene. I can assure you it’s anything but that, where you’ve had barricades, trying to keep officers in the Hartfield — Hatfield, excuse me, Courthouse; injury to a Border Patrol team member’s leg; injuries to the head, shoulder, and back of a deputy U.S. Marshal; U.S. Marshal impaled his right hand on a board filled with nails set out by the protesters.

答：首先讓我補充一點，他們還沒有被派到芝加哥。這些國土安全部官員目前在波特蘭保護一座法院。我們相信他們是合適的人選，正如《美國法典》第40章第1315條所規定的那樣。這是聳人聽聞的狀況：頻率干擾器， 顆粒和空氣步槍，就出現在波特蘭。它被描繪成一個太平景象。我可以向你保證，事實完全相反。在那裡，已經設置了路障，試圖將官員留在哈特菲爾德——哈特菲爾德，對不起——法院；一名邊境巡邏隊成員的腿部受傷；一名聯邦司法官的頭部、肩部和背部受傷；聯邦司法官的右手被抗議者設置的裝滿釘子的板子刺穿。

This is not a peaceful scene. And I’m very thankful to our U.S. Marshals and ATF and others who are acting in accordance with a statute in protecting a federal building, and doing so at great cost to themselves.

這不是一個太平景象。我非常感謝我們的美國法警和煙酒槍械局（ATF）和其他人員，他們根據法規行事保護聯邦設施，並為此付出了巨大的代價。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: Thanks, Kayleigh. I have two questions for you on the stimulus. First, since you guys are committed to the payroll tax cut, that seems to be driving up the price tag of the whole package. So does the White House view the $1 trillion figure that’s been cited by GOP leaders as a hard cap? Are you willing to sign something that would spend more than that?

問：謝謝你，凱莉。我有兩個關於經濟刺激計畫的問題要問你。首先，由於你們致力於減免工資稅，這似乎會抬高整個方案的價格標籤。那麼白宮是否視共和黨領袖們說所的1萬億美元的數字為一個硬性的上限？你是否願意簽署比這更多支出的計畫？

MS. MCENANY: These are all preliminary discussions. So, you know, I’ll leave it to the negotiators to decide. The trillion-dollar number was cited by Secretary Mnuchin yesterday.

答：這些都是初步討論。所以，你知道，我會讓談判者們來決定。姆努欽部長昨天提到了這個萬億美元的數字。

But, look, this is the beginning stages. We’re looking at a number of things. But the President was very clear that he would like to see a payroll tax in there, along with liability protections, tax credits for businesses to bring people back to work and to have safe work environments, and of course, the $70 billion for schools to reopen safely — at least $70 billion.

但是你看，這是開始階段。我們正在研究很多事情。但總統非常清楚，他希望看到減薪稅，以及責任保護，為企業提供稅收抵免，使人們重返工作崗位，並擁有安全的工作環境，當然，700億美元用於學校安全重新開放——至少700億美元。

Q: And then on the testing piece: What did the wait time — the long wait times that we’re seeing for tests around the country suggest that we do need a massive influx of testing beyond what’s unspent, and that the federal government should take more control of the federal — of the country’s testing program?

問：然後關於檢測方面：我們在全國各地看到的漫長的檢測等待時間說明了什麼？我們確實需要大量的資金湧入用於檢測，而且比未使用的資金更多，以及聯邦政府應該更多地控制聯邦的檢測專案？

MS. MCENANY: So we do want to see more testing funding, but we want it to be targeted in a way that it gets to the right people who need testing at the right time, not just dumping money into a bucket. So we want more money, and we want it to be targeted.

答：因此，我們確實希望看到更多的資金用於檢測，但我們希望它是有針對性的，它能在恰當的時機到達需要檢測的恰當的人，而不是僅僅把錢傾倒在一個桶裡。所以，我們希望有更多的資金，而且要有針對性。

But I’m glad you brought up the timing of the testing. I talked to Dr. Birx, and she’s very encouraged by the pool testing that’s being worked on. You can run four to five times as many tests in the same period of time by decreasing turnaround times at a minimum of two thirds. So if you took three days to get a test result, it goes down to less than one. If it took six days, it goes down to less than two. And it’s more labor intensive, so they would need to hire additional personnel. But CMS is funding the test at about four times the actual test cost to ensure technicians and PPE requirements can be met. So we are seeing encouraging signs on that front.

但我很高興你提出了檢測的時間的問題。我和伯克斯博士談過，正在進行的群體檢測非常鼓舞她。通過將周轉時間縮短至少三分之二，可以在同一時間段運行四到五倍的檢測。所以，如果要花三天時間得到一個檢測結果，它將能縮減到一天。假如以前需要花六天時間，現在花不到兩天。而且它的勞動強度更大，所以他們需要雇傭更多的人員。但醫療保險和醫療補助服務中心（CMS）以實際檢測成本的四倍左右的價格為檢測提供資金，以確保技術人員和個人防護裝備的要求能夠得到滿足。所以，我們看到了這方面令人鼓舞的勢頭。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: Thank you, Kayleigh. Just going back to the Portland situation: What is, sort of, the policy justification for federal officers not identifying their agency and their arrest authority when they take a protester into custody?

問：謝謝你，凱莉。回到波特蘭的情況：是什麼政策依據允許了聯邦官員在拘押抗議者時不表明其機構和逮捕許可權？

MS. MCENANY: So I’ve been told by DHS that there is insignia indicating that they’re law enforcement. They, in the case you’re referencing, did identify themselves to the individual being obtained, but that they don’t identify themselves to crowds because it would put them at great risk, and I think you can see that, as I noted, when they’re sticking their hands into boards left out by some of the rioters.

答：所以我被國土安全部告知，有徽章表明他們是執法人員。在你提到的情況下，他們確實向被抓的人表明了自己的身份，但他們不會向人群表明自己的身份，因為這將使他們面臨巨大的風險，我想你可以看到這一點，正如我所指出的，當他們的手被抗議者設置的板子刺穿。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: Hey, Kayleigh. You know, on June 16th — so a little more than a month ago — the White House, via the Vice President, published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. The op-ed said that “the media has tried to scare the American people” about the coronavirus. It talked about low positivity rates and declining case numbers in half of the states. There have been 25,000 additional deaths since that was published. Does the White House still stand by that op-ed?

問：嘿，凱莉。你知道，在6月16日——一個多月前——白宮通過副總統在《華爾街日報》上發表了一篇專欄文章。該專欄說，“媒體試圖在冠狀病毒上嚇唬美國人民”。它談到了在一半的州低陽性率和下降的病例數量。自該報告發表以來，又有25000人死亡。白宮還堅持這篇專欄活動的觀點嗎？

And then, just more generally, what happened here at the White House and the administration in the last month when the message was that this was a problem that was on the mend and being addressed, until now, with the exploding cases we’ve seen and 141,000 deaths?

然後，更籠統地來說，白宮和美國政府發生了什麼，從上個月，當時傳達的資訊是，這個問題正在得到解決，直到現在，我們所看到的爆炸性病例和141000人死亡？

MS. MCENANY: Well, the White House has always been very clear-eyed that as we reopened, we would see embers and, in some cases, fires. We’ve been very aggressive in addressing that; sent out 19 teams to go to emerging hotspots. Dr. Birx has been to nine states. She does a lot of extraordinary work on that front.

答：嗯，白宮一直非常清楚疫情如火，當我們重新開放時，我們會看到火苗，在某些情況下，還有大火。我們一直非常積極地解決這個問題；派出19個團隊去處理新興熱點。伯克斯博士去過九個州，她在這方面做了很多非凡的工作。

So we’ve been clear-eyed that as we reopened, we would see embers and sometimes fires. But we’re encouraged that when you look at case fatality, for instance, we’re below the European Union, we’re below the average of the world, and I think that that speaks to our incredible work with therapeutics and our incredible work with testing: 46 million tests. The number two in testing in the world is India at 13.79 million.

所以我們一直很清楚，當我們重新開業的時候，我們會看到火苗，有時候也會看到火苗。但我們感到鼓舞的是，當你看病例死亡率時，例如，我們低於歐盟，我們低於世界平均水準，我認為這說明我們在治療學方面的工作令人難以置信，我們在檢測方面的工作令人難以置信。4600萬次檢測。世界上檢測量排名第二的是印度，1379萬。

Q: Do you still see the main problem, as the op-ed pointed out, as the “media trying to scare the American people” over coronavirus?

問：正如專欄指出的，你是否仍然認為主要問題是“媒體試圖在冠狀病毒上嚇唬美國人民”嗎？

MS. MCENANY: I think, in many cases, the media has tried to scare the American people. I think there’s been a deficit in reporting about the cost of staying shut down, for instance.

我認為，在許多情況下，媒體試圖嚇唬美國人民。我認為，例如，在關於保持關閉的後果方面的報導一直嚴重不足。

When you have the fact that the American Cancer Society saying that, during the pandemic, we saw an 80 percent drop in cancer cases being identified, there are real costs to a draconian extended shutdown. And you never heard the other side of the health equation. You never heard that mammograms were down by 87 percent and colonoscopies down by 90 percent and drug overdoses going up month after month through the lockdown.

當你看到美國癌症協會說，在大流行期間，我們看到被發現癌症病例下降了80%，一個嚴厲的長期關閉確實有嚴重後果。你從沒聽過健康等式的另一面。你從來沒有聽說過乳房X光病例量下降了87%，結腸鏡病例量下降了90%，而藥物過量在封鎖中月月上升。

So it was the right decision to make. The President saved 3 to 4 million lives, but it’s important to note the other side of the health equation about what extended lockdowns do to the American people.

因此（封鎖）是正確的決定。總統挽救了300萬到400萬人的生命，但重要的是要注意健康等式的另一面，即延長封鎖對美國人民的影響。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: Yeah, the President says he wants to send these forces to other cities like Chicago, cities where the federal property isn’t necessarily under attack. What are they going to do when they get to Chicago and these other cities with higher crime rates, higher shooting rates, higher murder rates, if the President is worried about that? What are they going to do? What are they going to arrest people of -– with?

問：是的，總統說，他希望派遣這些部隊到其他城市，如芝加哥，那裡的聯邦財產不一定受到攻擊。如果他們到達芝加哥和其他犯罪率較高、槍擊率更高、謀殺率更高的城市時，如果總統擔心這一點，他們該怎麼辦？他們要做什麼？他們要用什麼來逮捕那些人？

MS. MCENANY: I think you’re getting ahead of the President here. He’s —

答：我想你的提問操之過急了。總統他——

Q: What federal charges?

問：什麼聯邦指控？

MS. MCENANY: He’s made no announcements as to who’s going where. He’s very discouraged by the violence that he’s seen in Chicago. It’s why he sent a very strong letter to Mayor Lightfoot offering help, because she’s clearly unable to control her streets, and the governor as well, unable to control that area.

答：他沒有宣佈誰要去哪裡。他在芝加哥看到的暴力使他非常沮喪。這就是為什麼他給萊特福市長寫了一封非常強有力的信，為她提供幫助，因為顯然她無法治理自己的街道，而州長也無法治理該地區。

When you see the fact that there were 49 officers who were injured in this egregious video of them being lambasted with rioters with umbrellas shielding from view that they were throwing projectiles, and 49 officers injured. Not only that: The poor citizenry of Chicago where 12 were murdered this weekend, 70 shot alone.

當你在這段令人髮指的錄影中看到有49名員警受傷時，他們遭到用雨傘遮擋自己的暴徒們投擲物的攻擊，49名員警受傷。不僅如此：芝加哥可憐的公民，這個週末有 12 人被謀殺，僅因槍擊受傷就有70人。

It’s incredible what we’re seeing in Chicago. He’s offered his help, and we encourage the mayor to take it and to be forthright about the situation in her state, much like the governor of Missouri was in working with us on Operation LeGend to protect the people of Missouri.

我們在芝加哥看到的真是不可思議。他主動提出要幫忙，我們鼓勵市長接受它，並直率地談論她州的情況，就像密蘇里州州長與我們合作執行“勒根德行動”以保護密蘇里州人民一樣。

Q: But the leaders of these cities don’t necessarily want unmarked police officers patrolling their streets the way we’ve seen in Portland, with the premise that they’re protecting federal property there. The leaders in these cities don’t want this, sort of, paramilitary police force.

問：但是這些城市的領導人不一定希望像我們在波特蘭看到那樣，讓沒戴徽章的員警在街上巡邏，前提是他們保護著那裡聯邦財產。這些城市的領導人不想要這種准軍事員警部隊。

MS. MCENANY: They’re offered the assistance of DOJ, as was done, where you’ve had FBI surge in the case of Operation LeGend. So when you have, each weekend, more than a dozen people getting shot in your city, perhaps it’s time — more than a dozen killed, I should say, and children — perhaps it’s time to say, “I need the help of the federal government because what I’m doing is simply not working.” When more people are dying on the streets of Chicago than Afghanistan and Iraq, it’s a tragedy.

答：正如勒根德行動一樣，他們得到了司法部（DOJ）的幫助，以及聯邦調查局（FBI）的增員。所以當你的城市，每個週末，都有十幾個人被槍殺，也許是時候了——我應該說，十幾個人被殺害，還有孩子們——也許是時候說，“我需要聯邦政府的説明，因為我所做的根本不起作用”。當芝加哥街頭死亡的人比阿富汗和伊拉克多時，這會是一場悲劇。

Q: What if they don’t say that, though?

問：如果他們不這麼說呢？

MS. MCENANY: Yes, Steven.

答：是的，史蒂文。

Q: Thank you. Well, I have a question about New York on a similar topic. Yesterday, President Trump mentioned the spike in violent crime in New York and said, quote, “If the governor is not going to do something about it, we’ll do something about it.” And I’m curious if you could explain why he is saying that the governors should do something about it rather than the mayor, and if you could also elaborate on what President Trump would be willing to do.

問：謝謝。嗯，我有個類似的關於紐約的問題。昨天，川普總統提到了紐約暴力犯罪的激增，並說，“如果州長不為此做點什麼，我們將會做點什麼”。我很好奇，如果你能解釋為什麼他說，州長應該做一些事情，而不是市長，如果可以也請詳細說明川普總統願意做什麼。

MS. MCENANY: Well, he thinks the mayor and the governors should work together to take control of the streets of New York City where, in some places, we’ve seen 600 percent surge in violence over last year. So he thinks they should work together.

答：嗯，他認為市長和州長們應該共同努力，控制紐約市街道的治安，特別是一些區域，暴力犯罪比去年增長了600%。所以他認為他們應該一起合作。

It’s ultimately the power of the mayor to enforce and the governor to enforce the police power of their states. That power rests with them, but they can partner with the federal government in the event that they’re unable to control the violence in their cities. And that’s certainly what we’ve seen from Mayor de Blasio, who seems to have not a hard time criticizing police officers but an awfully hard time controlling the streets of New York City.

歸根結底這是市長的執法權和州長的警權。這種權力在於他們，但如果他們無法控制城市的暴力，他們可以與聯邦政府合作。這顯然也是我們從市長德布拉西奧那裡看到的，他似乎對批評員警毫無壓力，但是治理紐約市街道卻困難重重。

Yes.

是的。

Q: Thanks so much. I have two questions. I’m the print pooler for today. One for myself and one for a colleague who cannot be here because of the social distancing. Governor Gavin Newsom was one of the few Democratic governors to bring in the National Guard and arm them after the riots and moving in early June, as compared to Seattle, where they didn’t arm the National Guard. The Guard was posted at Los Angeles City Hall as a show of force, and within days, the violence had quelled. Why not just invoke the Insurrection Act and have a big show of force rather than these more secretive operations?

問：非常感謝。我有兩個問題。今天由我彙集問題。一個自己的，一個來自一位因為社交距離而不能在這裡的同事。州長加文·紐森（Gavin Newsom）是少數在騷亂後引進國民警衛隊並武裝他們的民主黨州長之一。該州與當時沒有武裝國民警衛隊的西雅圖相比，警衛隊駐防在洛杉磯市政廳，以示武力，幾天後，暴力就平息了。為什麼不直接援引《起義法》，並大展武力，而不是這些更隱秘的行動呢？

MS. MCENANY: So I’ll leave that to the President. We don’t have secretive operations going on. It’s very clear what’s going on in Portland. It’s very clear what’s happening in Kansas City.

答：所以我就把它留給總統。我們沒有秘密行動。波特蘭到底怎麼回事一目了然。坎薩斯城發生了什麼也很清晰。

But with regard to the Insurrection Act, look, we believe that it should be governors and mayors doing what they have the constitutional power to do. The police power rests with them. So it’s up to this President whether he ever decides to invoke that, but governors and mayors really need to step it up, particularly in Democrat cities where Democrat streets are out of control.

但是，關於《反叛亂法》，我們認為應該由州長和市長實踐憲法賦予他們的權力。警權屬於他們。因此，由這位總統決定是否援引這一點，但州長和市長們確實需要落實這一點，尤其是在民主黨街道失控的民主黨城市裡。

Q: And then the one from my colleague. John Gizzi at Newsmax is asking: What are the President’s thoughts on John Kasich supporting Joe Biden and his plans to appear at the convention in Florida?

問：然後是我的同事的提問。新聞極限的約翰·吉齊問道：總統對約翰·凱西奇（John Kasich）支持喬·拜登（Joe Biden）以及他出席佛羅里達州大會的計畫有什麼想法？

MS. MCENANY: What was that? I didn’t hear the last part.

答：那是什麼？我沒聽到最後一部分。

Q: John Kasich is supporting Joe Biden, and he plans to attend the convention and support the Democratic Convention.

問：約翰·凱西奇支持喬·拜登，和他出席大會的計畫，以及支持民主黨大會。

MS. MCENANY: So that would be a question for the campaign. But this President is quite proud of his record in the Republican Party and quite proud to have the support of 96 percent of the party — more than any predecessor in the history of the Republican Party.

答：所以這將是一個關於競選的問題。但這位元總統為自己的在共和黨中的記錄感到非常自豪，也為自己得到96%的黨內支持而自豪——比共和黨歷史上任何前任都多。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: Thanks, Kayleigh. You said earlier that the President was tested multiple times a day. We knew he was tested daily, but can you elaborate on that? How many times a day is he tested?

問：謝謝，凱莉。你之前說過，總統每天接受多次測試。我們知道他每天都要接受測試，但你能詳細說明一下嗎？他每天測試多少次？

MS. MCENANY: He’s tested often. I’m not going to read out exactly how many times he’s tested a day, but sometimes it is more than one time a day.

答：他經常接受測試。我不會說具體他每天測試多少次，但有時一天不止一次。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: Yesterday, the President said that when he was previously doing briefings, we had a lot of people watching — record numbers watching in the history of cable television. And I was wondering if ratings are factoring into his decision to restart the briefing and if he is the best person to get accurate information about the virus out to the public, given previous statements at briefings, like the speculation that disinfectants inside the body could work as a treatment, which medical experts say is not the case, and claims that the virus will just disappear.

問：昨天，總統說，他以前做簡報時，我們有很多人在觀看——有線電視歷史上觀看的人數創紀錄。我想知道，收視率是否是他決定重新啟動簡報的考量，還有他是否是公眾獲得有關病毒的準確資訊最佳人選？鑒於他之前在簡報的聲明，例如被醫學專家否認的消毒劑在體內可以作為一種治療的猜測，還有聲稱病毒會消失的猜測。

MS. MCENANY: Well, the President is the right person to give information to the American people. He was elected by the American people. He’s been a leader on this. The fact that we’ve outproduced on ventilators so much so that we have an extraordinary number in our stockpile, and we’re giving ventilators out to the rest of the world; that we lead the world in testing: 46 million tests — more than that.

答：嗯，總統是向美國人民提供資訊的合適人選。他是美國人民選出的。他在這方面一直是領導者。事實上，我們已經生產了這麼多的呼吸機，以我們有一個非凡的庫存數額，我們正在提供呼吸機給世界其他地方；我們在測試方面領先世界：4600萬次測試——遠不止這些。

At this point, the fact that he’s broken down bureaucracy to get a vaccine into a phase three clinical trial, that because of him, we have remdesivir and convalescent plasma and dexamethasone and other therapeutics, he’s the right person to give the information to the American people. And, boy, does he get the information to a lot of the American people during his briefings, as noted by the ratings, as he himself pointed out.

在這一點上，事實上，他打破了官僚作風，使疫苗進入第三階段的臨床試驗，因為他，我們有瑞德西韋和康復血漿和地塞米松和其他治療方法，他是給美國人民提供資訊的合適人選。收視率所證明的，在他的簡報中，他為很多美國人民帶來了資訊。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: The U.S. Trade Representative is planning an additional set of tariffs against Europe in the old dispute about aerospace subsidies. Has the President committed to impose additional sanctions, considering that Europe would answer with additional sanctions — tariffs, as well?

問：美國貿易代表正計畫在歐洲航空補貼的舊爭端中增加一系列關稅。考慮到歐洲也會報以額外的制裁和增加關稅，總統是否承諾實施額外的制裁？

MS. MCENANY: So, since that’s pre-decisional, I won’t get ahead of — on any administration announcements on that front.

答：所以，既然這尚未決定，我就不會提前發佈任何有關這一方面的政府公告。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: Kayleigh, I have a couple of questions. The first one is: The President, in the last few hours, tweeted about the concerns about mail-in voting. So he’s obviously concerned about the integrity of the U.S. election and certainly internal sabotage. But why are we not hearing from the President about fears about external sabotage?

問：凱莉，我有幾個問題。第一個是：總統在幾個小時內發佈關注郵件投票的推特。因此，他顯然擔心美國大選的完整性，當然還有內部破壞。但是，為什麼我們沒有聽到總統對外部破壞的恐懼呢？

For example, coming out of the UK today, there is a Parliamentary Committee report that says that Russia influenced the Scottish referendum; there are questions about Brexit. But we’ve really not heard the President put the Kremlin on notice with respect to the U.S. election. Will we hear from him today on that?

例如，今天有一份從英國出爐的議會委員會報告說，俄羅斯影響了蘇格蘭公投;英國脫歐存在問題。但我們真的沒有聽到總統就美國大選告知克里姆林宮。我們今天會收到他的回復嗎？

MS. MCENANY: The President today has put the world on notice that our election systems must be secure. This is — under this President, in 2018, he articulated the first full cyber strategy for the United States since 2003. In 2019, he extended the National Emergency Declaration on Foreign Election Interference. He routinely engages with Congress on election security, particularly in at least 26 —

答：今天，總統已經告知全世界，我們的選舉系統必須安全。這是這位總統2018年闡述美國自2003年以來的第一個全面網路戰略。2019年，他延長了《關於外國干涉選舉的國家緊急聲明》。他經常與國會就選舉安全問題進行接觸，尤其是至少 26 次

Q: Right. But we had fresh reports.

Q 正確。但是我們有新的報告

MS. MCENANY: — elections, security-specific hearings. He signed legislation — $71 million — and so on and so forth. And that’s quite a contrast to the O Biden [sic] — the Obama-Biden administration, who when told of meddling in 2016, did nothing. And, in fact, Susan Rice told the White House cyber team to stand down and, quote, “knock it off” when they floated — when they floated options to combat Russian cyberattacks. And even Obama’s cyber chief, Michael Daniel, has confirmed the stand-down order.

答：選舉，安全聽證會。他簽署了7100萬美元的立法，等等。這與拜登——奧巴馬-拜登政府在2016年被告知干預卻什麼也沒做形成鮮明對比。事實上，當他們提出——當他們提出打擊俄羅斯網路攻擊的方案時，蘇珊·賴斯叫白宮網路團隊停工退下，引用她的話：“別鬧了”。甚至奧巴馬的網路主管邁克爾·丹尼爾也確認了此停工令。

Q: The President has been in office now more than three years. I’m asking what has been done now. And given these fresh concerns, when are we going to hear from the President on that?

問：總統已經上任三年多了。我在問現在做了什麼。鑒於這些新的關切點，我們什麼時候才能聽到總統的聲音？

MS. MCENANY: So what’s been done now — I just listed off three or four things for you, and I’m happy to go through more. We can talk about the $71 million —

答：現在已經做了這些——我剛剛為你列出了三到四件事情，我很高興能跟你歷數更多。我們可以談談 7100 萬美元——

Q: You know, actually, I have follow-up question with respect to Russia.

問：你知道，實際上，我有關於俄羅斯的後續問題。

MS. MCENANY: — in legislation on election security. We can talk about the $15 million for election reform activities. We can talk about legislation making more than $805 million available to states. And —

答：用於選舉安全的立法。我們可以談談1 500萬美元用於選舉改革活動。我們可以討論立法，使各州獲得超過8.05億美元。還有，

Q: So, Joe Biden put the Kremlin and others on notice.

問：所以，喬·拜登讓克里姆林宮和其他人注意到。

MS. MCENANY: And when it comes to mail-in voting, I would point you to the fact that there’s a Wall Street Journal article just out today, and it talks about the dark omen for November and the absolute catastrophe in New York City that we are a month into the election after the voting, and we still don’t know who the winners are of some of those races.

答：當談到郵寄投票時，我要指出，今天有一篇《華爾街日報》的文章剛剛發表，它談到了11月的黑暗兆頭和紐約市的絕對災難，即我們在選舉投票開始的一個月後，我們仍然不知道其中一些競選的贏家是誰。

And Governor Cuomo decided that he would pre-pay postage for the ballots. And what that meant was that the Post Office didn’t put a postage stamp noting the date of the ballots. So as they’re collecting these ballots in — for a month —

庫莫州長決定為選票預付郵資。這意味著郵局沒有蓋上印有投票日期的郵票。因此，當他們收集這些選票在 ——一個月——

Q: I think this is getting off track. Let’s —

問：我認為這已經偏題了。讓我們——

MS. MCENANY: You asked me about this, so I’m going to answer. So, for a month, they’ve collecting ballots with no postmark date. And, in fact, what they found is 19 percent of ballots have been rejected in Queens, 28 percent rejected in Brooklyn.

答：你問我這個問題，所以我要回答。所以，一個月來，他們一直在收集沒有郵戳日期的選票。事實上，他們發現19%的選票在皇后區被否決，28%的選票在布魯克林被否決。

There are questions about mail — mass mail-out [sic] voting.

大範圍應用郵寄投票，郵寄選票存有許多問題。

Q: Yeah, that’s one of (inaudible). I’m asking about foreign interference.

問：是的，其一是…。我在問關於外國干涉的問題。

MS. MCENANY: And I know you don’t want to hear them, which is why you talk over me.

答：我知道你不想聽我正在說的東西，這就是為什麼你一直在說三道四。

Q: Okay.

問：好吧。

MS. MCENANY: But I encourage you to read the op-ed.

答：但我鼓勵你閱讀這篇專欄文。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: Okay, let me just redirect on the China vaccine research. Russia has interfered —

問：好的，讓我把問題轉到中國疫苗研究。俄羅斯干涉了——

MS. MCENANY: Yes, you’ve gotten two questions, which is more than some of your colleagues.

答：是的，你已經提問了兩個問題，這比你的一些同事都多。

Yes.

下一位。

Q: Okay, you don’t want to engage.

問：好吧，你不想回答。

Q: Thank you, Kayleigh. In St. Louis, the McCloskeys have been charged with felonies for waving guns at protesters. The Missouri Attorney General is vowing to dismiss these charges. Where does the President stand on this?

問：謝謝你，凱莉。在聖路易斯，麥克洛斯基一家因向抗議者揮舞槍支而被指控犯有重罪。密蘇里州總檢察長發誓要駁回這些指控。總統對此的立場是什麼？

MS. MCENANY: Yeah, the President — I asked him about that this morning, and he said it is absolutely absurd what is happening to the McCloskeys. He noted that this is an extreme abuse of power by the prosecutor and noteworthy that the prosecutor — there have been many cases brought to her attention of violent rioters that she’s failed to charge, but instead she’s charging the individuals who were defending themselves from violent protesters. You have 300 to 500 protesters who stormed the gates, tore down the gates, and trespassed on their property.

答：是的，總統——我今天上午問他這個問題，他說麥克洛斯基一家的遭遇絕對荒謬。他指出，這是檢察官對權力的極度濫用，值得注意的是，檢察官所知到的許多案件內她都未能起訴暴力的暴亂者們，但她卻指控那些向暴力抗議者自我防衛的人。有300到500名抗議者沖進大門，撕毀大門，侵入他們的財產。

And you have Patricia McCloskey who said that they were telling her they were going to kill them, these protesters, at the moment they were waving their guns to protect themselves. “They were going to come in here,” she said. “They were going to burn down the house. They were going to be living in our house after I was dead and they were pointing to different rooms of the house saying, ‘That’s going to be my bedroom.’ ‘That’s going to be my living room.’ And ‘I’m going to be taking a shower in that room.’” So they were completely within their right. And it’s an egregious abuse of power on the part of the McCloskeys.

還有派特裡夏·麥克洛斯基，她說，這些抗議者他們告訴她，他們將殺死他倆時，他們揮舞著槍保護自己。“他們要來這裡”，她說。“他們要燒毀房子。我死後，他們要住在我們的房子裡，他們會指著房子裡的不同房間說，‘那是我的臥室’。‘這將是我的客廳’。‘我要在那個房間裡洗澡’”。因此，他們（的自衛）完全在他們的權利範圍內。對麥克洛斯基一家的指控是一種嚴重的權力濫用行為。

Turning to a different note: I just wanted to highlight some — some great work being done by senior advisor Ivanka Trump. There are nearly 40 million boxes that have been put together by the Farmers to Family Food Box Program, a great partnership to help families in need in this country. And yesterday, you had Ivanka Trump visiting the D.C. Dream Center and personally distributing a number of food boxes. The distribution resulted in 1,000 boxes delivered to the D.C. community. And we thank Ivanka for the great work that she has done there.

談到另一個注意：我只是想強調一些——高級顧問伊萬卡 · 川普正在做的一些偉大的工作。農民和家庭食品盒計畫已經拼湊了近4000萬個盒子，這是幫助這個國家貧困家庭的一個很好的夥伴關係。昨天，你讓伊萬卡·川普參觀了華盛頓特區的夢幻中心，並親自分發了一些食品盒，向華盛頓特區社區分發了1000箱。我們感謝伊萬卡在那裡所做的偉大工作。

And finally, I just wanted to note something on COVID. Dr. Birx is an extraordinary doctor who has served this country, dedicated her time to serving our country as an Army colonel. She has served as an ambassador to PEPFAR where she spent her life fighting AIDS and HIV abroad. And it is appalling the attack that I saw on her in the New York Times, based on no facts.

最後，我只是想在新冠方面說明一下。伯克斯博士是一位非凡的醫生，她為這個國家服務過，作為陸軍上校她把時間奉獻給了我們的國。她曾擔任總統防治愛滋病緊急救援計畫（PEPFAR）的大使，在那裡她一生在國外抗擊愛滋病和愛滋病毒。我在《紐約時報》上看到對她的攻擊是駭人聽聞的，沒有事實根據。

And Dr. Birx, for weeks, has been sending out this data to governors — 400 pages of data to our governors — so that they have the best information to make the best decisions for their people in their respective states. I’ve not seen anyone pouring over data the way Dr. Birx has, and the attack on her was, frankly, appalling and egregious, and the New York Times should be very ashamed of themselves.

幾周來，伯克斯博士一直在向州長發送這些資料——400頁的資料給州長——以便他們擁有最好的資訊，為各自州的人民做出最佳決策。我沒有看到任何人像伯克斯博士那樣提供大量的資料，坦率地說，對她的攻擊是駭人聽聞和駭人聽聞的，《紐約時報》應該為自己感到羞愧。
