## 习近平要让美国出来给病毒背书&nbsp; 然后私下承诺什么都可以谈&nbsp; 否则…

**摘要：在2021年5月1日的盖特视频中，郭先生揭露了目前中共党内政治斗争目前非常激烈；中共想要做的是让美国为病毒的泄露说或自然来源说背书，然后私下承诺什么都可以谈，否则将要发动台湾战争来转移大众视线，将焦点由病毒转移至战争；同时，以战争来要挟世界上的其他国家，如印度、日本和澳大利亚，让他们对病毒真相保持沉默。**

**习近平现在是中南海的“光杆司令”，党内没人敢讲国内经济形势以及世界政治形势的真话。一旦发动了台海战争，习愿意牺牲成百上万的军人！他认为，当战争中的死亡人数达到一定程度时，美国会变心软而不愿再战。中共的底线是，只要不打北京，死多少人都可以。战争胜利后，习将专心清理王岐山、曾庆红、江泽民等政敌。**

**Xi Is Willing to C****ompromise Anything Economically If the U.S. Endorses the CCP, Otherwise…**

现在国内形势非常紧张，大家都看到了现在党内都知道曾、王、习大战已经到了中期段落了。作为姥姥家是福建的曾庆红、山东人的儿子王岐山和河南人的儿子长在陕西的习大神，这一波较量到了最关键的时刻。

Currently, the domestic situation in China is very tense. You all have seen it. Everybody in the CCP knows that the battle between Zeng (Qinghong), Wang (Qishan), and Xi (Jinping) has reached the mid-stage. Zeng Qinghong’s grandmother is from Fujian. Wang Qishan is a son of Shandong. The great god Xi (Xi Jinping) is a son of Henan, and grew up in Shanxi. This wave of competition between them has reached the most critical moment.

而且最近共产党内部已经明确了，非常清楚的一定要打好冠状病毒这一仗。打好冠状病毒仗是什么呢？就是让美国必须站出来为共产党背书，让美国说这是武汉实验室泄露或来自自然，跟共产党没有关系。让美国出来背书，然后私下承诺什么都可以谈，经济上怎么都可以谈，同时做好「准备」如果美国不这么做就打台湾。「在」台湾、南海跟美国干一场，做好牺牲50万所谓的共产党人民解放军战狼的准备，把美国这届政府打垮，把美国的经济打垮，让全世界的注意力全注意到台湾和南海之战上去，不再谈管状病毒。这说明了什么兄弟姐妹们？说明了共产党知道冠状病毒会要它的命。

It has recently been made clear within the CCP that they must fight this coronavirus battle cleverly. How to fight the coronavirus battle? By making the United States endorse the CCP, make the U.S. say that the coronavirus is either leaked from the Wuhan lab, or that it came from nature and it has nothing to do with the CCP. If the U.S. endorses the CCP, the CCP can privately talk with the U.S., promise everything, and compromise anything economically. At the same time, the CCP is prepared to attack Taiwan if the U.S. does not do as it wants. They are prepared to go to a war with the U.S. in Taiwan and in the South China Sea and to sacrifice 500,000 wolf-warrior soldiers from the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of the CCP, to bring down the current U.S. administration and knock down the U.S. economy. The CCP wants to distract world’s attention from the coronavirus pandemic to the war in Taiwan and the South China Sea. What does this mean, brothers and sisters? It shows that the CCP knows that the truth about the coronavirus will end its life.

同时要让印度彻底服软；要让日本感到恐惧；澳大利亚感到恐惧；要让美国人感到病毒的事情绝对不能去追究共产党的责任，绝对不能查真相，更不可能给你解药。当然这个战略一出来，习大神孤家一人了。中南坑改成习一坑了，因为只有习近平一个在城坑里边了，所有的常委的人都跑出去了，找各种理由溜出去就「是」不在中南坑里待着了，给你习一个人的，叫习一坑，习一坑。就现在给你吧。就像我告诉大家的一样：整个中南坑现在就俩人跟着，就习相信的 — 杨娘娘、王公公。

Meanwhile, the CCP wants to completely subdue India, to terrify Japan, to frighten Australia, and to make the U.S. abandon the idea of holding them accountable for the coronavirus pandemic. The truth about the virus must not be investigated, and there is absolutely no possibility for them to give out the antidote. Of course, as soon as this strategy was revealed, the great god Xi became a one-person captain. The Zhongnan pit became Xi’s one-person pit because only Xi Jinping was left in this pit. All the CCP’s Standing Committee members have ran away. They found all kinds of excuses to slip out and do not stay in the Zhongnan pit anymore. “Here you are. This place is all yours, for you Xi Jinping alone. Let’s call it Xi’s one-man-pit. We give it to you now.” As I mentioned earlier, there are only two people standing with Xi in the entire Zhongna pit. Only two people whom Xi still trusts – Sissy Yang (Yang Jiechi) and Eunuch Wang (Wang Yi).

现在所有的外交部还有中国金融系统给习作报告「的时候」，像4月份这个经济报告，大家说一定不能说实话，不能把民生的事说出来，不能把许家印的恒大说出来，更不能把招商银行「说」出来，也不能把平安的事情说出来，也不能特别是「把」现在香港的经济形势说出「来」，「只能编」各种瞎话的骗人。现在来自于中东的捷报频传和非洲司的外交部的捷报频传掩盖了世界上向中共讨要冠状病毒真相，和全世界都在加剧憎恨共产党同时，怪罪亚洲人的真相。一切都被盖住了，一切都被盖住了。所以说现在习大神叫习一坑，「他」活得很滋润，叫打好冠状病毒这一场「仗」，让印度彻底跪下来，让日本感到恐惧。「如果」你不恐惧，下个就是你。让澳大利亚彻底害怕，不行就给你来一剂猛「药」。让全世界看：看到没有？给我对抗的结果就是这个，这是真正的「他们的想法」。

Currently, when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance make presentations to Xi (e.g. the economic outlook report published in April), everybody says that you must not tell the truth. You cannot tell the truth about Minsheng Bank, about Xu Jiayin and his Hengda Group, definitely not mention the troubles at China Merchant Bank, at Ping An Insurance, and particularly don’t mention the current economic situation in Hong Kong. Just make up all kinds of nonsense to deceive him. Now there is triumphant news coming out of the Middle East, and good news keeps pouring in from the Department of African Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This helps to cover up the truth that the world is asking the CCP for the truth about coronavirus, and that the hatred towards the CCP is intensifying around the world. At the same time, Asians are being blamed for the pandemic. Everything is covered up. That’s why the great god Xi is called “one-person Xi” now. His life is pretty good. He demanded that the CCP has to win beautifully in the battle of the coronavirus. The strategy is to make India kneel down and then make Japan feel terrified. Because if you [Japan] do not back off, you will be the next target. Secondly, to make Australia completely terrified, otherwise Australia will get a dose of “strong medicine” [meaning virus] from the CCP. Make the world pay attention: “Have you seen what we (the CCP) can do? This is your destiny if you dare to confront us.” This is the CCP’s real plan.

党内现在大家都已经清楚了：曾、王挑战习一定会有一方倒下或者全倒下。现在曾庆红每天都活在他姥姥家 — 福建，邓六金的老家。「他」那是有想法的。

It is now clear to everyone that within the CCP, Zeng and Wang are challenging Xi and in the end one side will fall, or all sides will fall. Zeng Qinghong is currently living in his grandma Deng Liujin’s hometown in Fujian. He has ideas.

习现在就两「张」牌了：我手里有合法的控制国家的武器 — 军队，第二，不行我就打台湾。但是这种事情在任何时候都是双利剑，「一旦」军队不听指挥咋办？你打台湾你咋知道美国不打你北京城啊？但习的内心世界绝对相信美国只能会打代理人战争绝不会直面冲突，所以他觉得「如果」牺牲到50万大军美国人一定退。就是我让血流成河让你美国人害怕，就是你杀了我的人，我拿「些」孩子「让」你杀到手软，最后你就把我放过了。

Xi has two cards left now: first he has the army, a legal weapon, with which he can control the country. Secondly, if this doesn’t work, he will attack Taiwan. But this is always a double-edged sword. What if the army does not obey him? How can he be sure that the U.S. won’t attack Beijing when he attacks Taiwan? But Xi deeply believes that the U.S. can only fight proxy wars and will never engage in head-on confrontations. Therefore, he feels that Americans definitely will retreat if the CCP sacrifices 500,000 Chinese soldiers. That is, the CCP thinks they can scare the Americans when they see the battlefield flowing with rivers of blood. The Americans will be allowed to kill Chinese soldiers. The CCP is willing to sacrifice Chinese kids until the Americans become soft-hearted and lose their stomach for the fight. Then the U.S. will let the CCP have their way in the end.

这都是流氓、黑帮、贩毒分子的事：生几十个孩子，把孩子扔出几个去让警察杀，杀到你自己不敢杀了，你把我「就」放过了。就是让台湾死伤个百八十万人，让所谓的共产党的人民军队也就是共产党的党卫军死伤了四五十万人，把那辽宁什么伯格宁号「你美国人」也干掉它，把南海机场「让」你炸毁它，不行把海南几个基地让给你，把大连青岛几个基地让给你，你炸毁「不」就完了呗？你别打我北京城。但是这个一但「实现」了，那习就「有」优势了，拿出手来就把王和曾「派势力」通通的抹「平」了，江家就更不在话下「了」。

This is the behavior of gangsters, mafia, and drug dealers: giving birth to dozens of children, then throwing out a few of them to be killed by the police until the police themselves get sick of killing and give you a break. They are okay with hundreds of thousands or a million casualties in Taiwan, sacrificing half a million PLA soldiers, i.e., the CCP’s Schutzstaffel, and letting the Americans destroy the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning (Varyag) and blow up Nanhai Airport. If that’s not enough, the CCP will let the Americans blow up bases in Hainan, Dalian, and Qingdao, okay? Just don’t strike us here in Beijing. Once this goal is achieved, Xi will have the upper hand. He can be spared to eliminate Wang and Zeng’s rival forces and take down Jiang’s (Jiang Zemin) family without any problem.

所以习现在：对内捞经济，能拿谁拿谁的，准备好最坏的时刻到来，要打好这个半场的战争就是要让印度跪下来，让日本害怕，让澳大利亚害怕，然后让美国哆嗦，就是一个它「共产党」最想要的结局。然后「一旦外部」没事了，或者打台湾或者内部解决。这就是习要坚持住的，这今年「是中国传统的」辛丑年真不容易。现在变成“习一坑”了，这真的对他来讲「也」很危险，「成了」孤家寡人了。

So, Xi’s current plan is to control the domestic economy, take whatever he can from whomever he can, and prepare for the worst moment to come. To put up a good fight of this “half-time” war he plans to make India kneel down, frighten Japan and Australia, and make the U.S. tremble. This is what the CCP wants most. Once everything is okay externally, the CCP will either attack Taiwan or solve its problems internally. This is what Xi is counting on. This year is the traditional Chinese year of Xin Chou (38th year of the 60-year cycle). It is really not an easy year. Now it [the CCP] has become Xi’s one-person pit, which is extremely dangerous to him. He is all isolated, being cut off from others.
