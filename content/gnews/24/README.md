**朱利安尼市长讲话全文（中英文对照）**

Good afternoon!  Thank you very much for giving me a few minutes.  I’ve been testified before you about a month ago, and I want to commend, I want to commend you on holding this hearing and delving so deeply into the fact that so many other people avoiding and pretending didn’t exist.  I started listening to a good deal of the testimony before I stood here, and I can’t imagine that people ignoring it.

下午好！非常感谢你们能给我几分钟的时间。大约一个月前，我就已经在你们面前作证过，对你们深入地研究这些被很多人逃避和假装不存在的事实，并举行这场听证会，在此向你们表达我的敬意。在我站在这里之前就已经听了大量的证词，我无法想像人们会忽视它。

Your secretary of State’s office last night and today said this was the cleanest election in history or purest election in history.  He must be living on some other planets or drinking something that affects his senses because it’s just the opposite.  This is probably the worst situation of voter fraud we’ve ever had in this country.  Georgia is one example of it.  You know there are other examples of it.  Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, just to name a few.  And you, in your case, you have documentary evidence of it.  This is, whatever, whatever the result, this election is going to live in history.  This could be the election will be the dirtiest election, the most crooked election, the most manipulated election in American history, because there are more facts to be gathered, even more than we have been able to gather in the month and a half we’ve had to investigate it.

你们的州务卿办公室昨晚和今天都说这是历史上最干净的选举或者说最纯洁的选举。他一定是住在什么别的星球上，或者喝了一些影响他神志的东西，因为事实恰恰相反。这可能是这个国家有史以来最严重的选举舞弊。佐治亚州就是一个例子。你知道还有其它的例子。宾夕法尼亚、密歇根、亚利桑那、内华达，仅举几个例子。以你们州为例，你有书面证据。无论最后结果如何，这次选举都将被记入历史。这次选举有可能将是最肮脏的选举，最扭曲的选举，美国历史上最受操纵的选举，因为还会收集到更多的事实，甚至比我们调查了一个半月以来所能收集到的还要多。

It’s going to be much greater dimension then we already know, and it’s going to involve international connections.  Which means people are going to look back on this and they’re going to say what did you do about it?  I mean a year form now, two years from now, people going to look back on and say what did you do about the fraud?  Did you just sit by and let it happen?  And Georgia is going to be at the center of it because you have what I call the Zapruder film, the Zapruder film.  I don’t know if everybody remember this Zapruder film, but it was the film of the Kennedy assassination that demonstrated the inadequacy with the Warren Commission that live in infamy now.  You don’t want to live in infamy; you want to live in heroism.  And you want to live in a situation where you do something about it, and you’re not coward by the media, by big tech, big corporations.

它将比我们已知的要大得多，而且涉及到国际[势力]的参与。这意味着当人们看这段历史时，他们会问：你们对此做了什么？我是说，从现在起的一年、两年之后，人们回顾时会说：你对欺诈做了什么？你是否就此坐视不管？而佐治亚将会成为舆论的焦点，因为你们将如泽普鲁德的录影片、泽普鲁德胶片 — 我不知道大家是否还记得泽普鲁德的录影，但是这个关于肯尼迪遇刺当天的录像，揭示出了华伦委员会调查的不称职。他们现在已经声名狼藉。你不想活在骂名中；你想活得英勇，你应该为自己创造一种有所作为的局面，而不是屈从于媒体、大型科技公司和大公司的恐吓。

And unfortunately, the crooked leadership of the Democrat Party because this was not an accident.  This was organized.  What happened here in this State is precisely the same thing that happened in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, in Arizona, and some of it happened at exactly the same time.  Particularly that phony, phony situation at the Fulton County center, which, which you have documented.  If you can watch that and not realize that this was a major situation of voter fraud, then you’re a fool or a liar.

不幸的是[我们面对的是]不诚实、不道德的民主党领袖，因为这不是一个意外事件，这是有组织的。在这个州发生的事情和在宾夕法尼亚州、密歇根州、亚利桑那州发生的事情完全一样，而且其中一些是在同一时间发生的，特别是在富尔顿县中心发生的那种极其虚假的事件，你们都已记录在案。如果你看过这些纪录却没有意识到这是一个重大的选举舞弊，那么你就是个傻瓜或者是个骗子。

It’s quite obvious that they are counting ballots illegally.  The law of this State says that the counting of ballots has to be public, that it has to be allow inspectors.  It has to allow both sides to have chance to observe it.  I mean the law of every state just about requires that.  Well, you can see the people being thrown out.  You could see them being thrown out.  You can see them checking all around, and then in a very, very suspicious way counting ballots so fast they couldn’t possibly look at the signatures; they couldn’t possibly look at the ballots.  And then you can see them counting the ballots more than once, two, three, four, five times.  You would have to be a moron not to realize that voter fraud.  And you just take a look at the balance counter during that period of time, and you deduct that number of ballots from Fulton County, the winner of this election in Georgia is President Trump, not Joe Biden.

很明显，他们在非法记票。该州的法律规定：计票必须是公开的，必须允许检查人员在场，必须让两党代表都有机会观察到它。我是说，每个州的法律都会要求这样做。你们可以看到人们被赶出去了，可以看到他们被赶了出去！你们可以看到他们四处查看，然后以一种非常非常可疑的方式对选票进行快速统计，快到连他们自己都没时间查看签名；快到他们无法仔细地看选票。然后看到他们计算选票的次数不止一次、两次、三次、四次、五次。只有傻瓜才会看不出这是选举舞弊行为。你们只需要看一下这段时间的计票平衡表，然后从富尔顿县扣除那些选票，佐治亚州这次选举的获胜者是川普总统，而不是乔·拜登。

And that will be provable a year from now, and two years from now, and 10 years from now, and it’s really a disservice to the people of the state that leaves a stigma that you shouldn’t have.  They are going to ask; you can be sure.  Because this is going to continue unless we stop it.  It’s going to continue the misuse of the mail, the mail-in ballot.  All the terrible things that were predicted as to what would happen if you went to some kind of major mail-in ballot system, predictions made by Secretary Baker, President Carter, Justice Souter, and scholars.  The minute you have mail in ballots, you’re going to have major fraud.  76% of European countries do not allow mail-in ballot for the very reason that they invite fraud.  Well, we just proved it to the world.  Sure, it invites fraud, plenty of fraud.

也许从现在一年后、两年后、十年后得到证实，这确实给这个州的人民带来了伤害，给该州留下不该有的污名。可以肯定他们会问的，因为除非我们阻止，否则这种事还会继续下去。滥用邮件，即邮寄投票，将被继续。所有关于在主要的选举系统中使用邮寄选票所会产生的恶性事件的预言，都会发生：贝克部长、卡特总统、大法官苏特和学者们都做出过这样的预测。就在你们决定使用邮寄投票的那一刻，重大舞弊也随之而来。76%的欧洲国家不允许邮寄投票，原因就在于它们会引发欺诈。因此，我们刚好向全世界证明了了这一点。当然它会导致欺诈，大量的欺诈。

The people in Fulton County were instructed not to look at signatures.  They were instructed to do that, and you have testimony to that effect.  Not only do you have testimony that effect, you have film that shows you them not looking at the signature, doing this.

富尔顿县的工作人员被告知不用看签名。他们被要求这么做，你们有证据证明这一点。你们不仅有证据证明这一点，还有录像显示他们没有看签名（市长用肢体语言表达）。

It’s going to happen again.  Well, it’s not just going to happen again, it’s happening right now as I speak in the election that’s going on.  The same fraud that went on in the prior election is going on right now with the mail-in ballot because of the unlawful, unconstitutional consent decree that your secretary of state, I guess, entered into.  I don’t know what’s wrong with him.  But that consent decree you serve your power as a state legislature,  you’re supposed to make those changes.

这将再次发生。哦，它不仅将来会再次发生，就在我对选举做发言的这一刻，它正在发生着。在之前的选举中发生的同样的欺诈，现在是以邮寄投票方式发生，我想，是因为你们的州务卿签署了非法的、违宪的准许令。我不知道他是怎么回事。但是这个准许令要求你们作为州立法机关行使权力，你们应该做出这些改变。

The Constitution gives the authority to you.  The Constitution also says the buck stops here and the buck stops with the state legislature.  You’re responsible for those numbers that have been submitted to Washington.  Is there anybody that believes that Georgia submitted the right number of votes to Washington?  Is there anybody that would like to put their name on an affidavit that’s true and correct, and take a risk of going to jail?  As a lawyer I would instruct not to do that because it is not a person in Georgia or a person in the Untied States that believes that those numbers are correct.

宪法赋予你们权力。宪法还规定：责任制止于此，州立法机关制止此事。你们对那些提交给华盛顿的数字是负有责任的。有人相信佐治亚州向华盛顿提交了正确数量的选票吗？有人愿意冒着坐牢的风险，在一份权威的宣誓书上对其真实性和正确性签名吗？作为一名律师，我会告诫不要这样做，因为没有一个佐治亚州人或美国人相信这些数字是正确的。

If you, again, if you look at that one recording, that one tape, you know that they’re not correct.  Or if you look at the fact that you had 2,560 felons vote, you had 15,700 people vote in Georgia who changed their address before the election.  You had 40,000 people fail to re-register before they voted.  You had 10,315 people that we can determine from obituaries would be dead when they voted.  That’s pretty tough to do to vote when you dead.  So, right away that number you submitted to Washington is a lie.  It’s not true.  It’s false.  Minus 10,000 dead people, those are the number of dead people we were able to figure out by looking at obituaries. Because your secretary of state is engaged in what I consider an unlawful cover up, he won’t let us look at records.

再说一次，如果你们看那盘录音，那盘磁带，就会知道它们是不正确的。或者如果你们查看一下事实，有2560名重罪犯投票，在佐治亚州有15,700人在选举前更改地址，有4万人在投票前没有重新注册。通过讣告我们获知，有10,315人在投票时已经去世了。人在死后还能投票，那是很难的！所以你们提交给华盛顿的数字是一个谎言。这不是真实的，是骗人的。减去1万名死者，而这是我们通过看讣告得出的死亡人数。由于你们的州务卿在从事我认为是非法的掩盖行为，因此他不让我们查看记录。

If the Dominion machines are what we say they are, and we’ve tested the Dominion machines in Michigan, those machines are like Swiss cheese.  You can invade them; you can get in them; you can change the vote; you can fractionalize the vote.  Why would you ever fractionalize a vote?  There’s not such a thing as half a vote, or 1/4 of a vote.  Why would you have an election machine where you can change the vote?  The liars who run Dominion have said you can’t change the vote.  Read the manual!  Read the manual!  Their manual says you can change the vote.  Why should you be allowed to change a vote in a voting machine?  Once that vote goes in there, That’s it!  Shouldn’t be able to change it, you shouldn’t be able to move it from Trump to Biden, from Biden to Trump. Well, you can do that in the Dominion machine.

如果多米尼机器是我们所说的那样，我们曾在密歇根测试了多米尼机器，那些机器就像瑞士奶酪[到处是漏洞]，可以被入侵，可以被黑客；还可以把选票计算成小数点后几位数。为什么要把投票计算为小数点后的分位数？没有所谓的1/2票或1/4票。为什么要使用可以更改选举的机器？多米尼公司的骗子说不能改变投票结果，读一下手册！读一下手册！他们的手册上说投票机可以更改投票。为什么要允许投票机更改投票？一旦选票投进去，就结束了！不应该能够改变它，你们不应该能把它从川普转到拜登，从拜登转到川普。好吧，多米尼机器能做到这一点。

Our people have expected 22 Dominion machines.  We have submitted affidavits from, and they’re all ex-military people who did this work for the NSA and for the United States government.  Every time they would count in the machine, they would get a different count.  They were able to move votes, massive number of votes from one side to the other.  They caught in this county 6,000 votes having been moved from Trump to Biden, which had to be reversed.  But there are the only machines we’ve ever gong to look at.  If 22 machines move 6,000 votes, how many machines you have here?  How many votes do you think they moved?  And why is it the Secretary of State won’t allow us to examine them?  If he’s so sure this was cleanest election in history, let us examine the machines.  We’ll find out really fast.  We’ll find out really fast if this is the cleanest election in history, or the biggest scandal in terms of voting in the history of our country.  We’ll find out in two days.

我们的团队曾得到22台多米尼机器，我们已经提交了宣誓书，他们都是为国家安全局和美国政府工作的前军人。每次他们在机器里计数时，他们会得到不同的数字。他们能够移动选票，将大量的选票从一人挪给另一人。他们发现，这个县有6000张选票从川普转到了拜登名下，结果不得不做还原处理。但这些是我们唯一能够进行检查的机器。如果22台机器能移动6000张选票，你们这里有多少台机器？你们觉得他们转移了多少票？为什么州务卿不允许我们检查？如果他这么确定这是有史以来最干净的选举，那就让我们来检查这些机器。我们很快就会找到答案。我们很快就会知道这是历史上最干净的选举，还是我国历史上最大的投票丑闻。我们只需要两天就能知道。

Or we can, we can go get the gentleman you had before.  The gentleman who had here before who can examine the ballots.  He can tell you in a day.  He could find out were their illegal ballots submitted.  He can tell you whether it’s an official ballot of the State of Georgia, or one make up in a garage somewhere, so they could plug in an extra 30 or 40,000 Biden votes.  He can tell you that definitively, scientifically.  We can find out if it was the cleanest election in history or the biggest fraud in history.

或者我们可以，我们可以去找之前的那位绅士。之前来过的那位绅士可以检查选票。他在一天之内就能告诉你们。他能查出他们是否提交了非法选票。他可以告诉你们，这是否是佐治亚州的官方选票，或是在某车库里造的选票，这样就能给拜登多增加3万到4万张选票。他可以以科学的方式明确地告诉你。这样我们就能知道这次的选举是史上最廉洁的，还是史上最大的欺诈了。

Who stopping us?  Your Secretory of State is stopping us.  If he’s so sure that this was the cleanest vote ever in history, then let us examine ballots.  Let us forensically examine the ballots.  Let’s not keep recounting the same crooked votes that we counted in the 1st place.  The recount in Cobb County is a joke.  It’s an insult.  I can keep, I can keep recounting the same phony votes over and over again, and look at the same result.  Let us examine the ballots instead Mr. Secretory of State!  Let us examine the machine!  Why you stopping us from doing that?  Why you stopping the people from Georgia to find out?  If these allegations are made now by numerous witnesses, I don’t know how many witnesses you’ve had that have demonstrated fraud?  Let’s find out how expensive was!  It’s easy to do.  It will take about 3, 4 days.  There are scientific process to do it.  And, if you need evidence this was deliberate fraud, that’s your best evidence.

是谁阻止我们？你们的州务卿在阻止我们。如果他这么肯定这是史上最干净的投票，那我们来检查一下选票。让我们对选票进行法医式检查。我们不要再去重复计算那些我们在一开始就已经检查过的虚假的选票了。科布县的重新计票就是个笑话。那是一种人格侮辱，只能一遍又一遍地重复计算相同的假选票，看到相同的结果。让我们来检查一下选票本身吧，州务卿先生！让我们检查一下机器吧！你为什么要阻止我们？你为什么要阻止佐治亚州的人们去查明真相？如果现在这些指控是由无数证人提出的，我不知道曾经又有多少证人证明过了欺诈？让我们看看这样做的代价吧！这很容易做到，大约需要3、4天。可以通过科学程序操作。如果你需要证据来证明蓄意欺诈，那样做就是最好的证据。

Why would they stop?  The gentleman who testified earlier from examining ballots this morning, other than the fact that they know if he examines those ballots, he’s going to pull out 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 ballots that were made up by the Democrat Party and submitted and put in during the period of time, like what you saw on the video.  That’s exactly what’s happening.  And if you look at the number of votes during that period of time, Biden gained a 138,000 votes advantage during that period of time from those votes.  You take that advantage away.  Who wins this State?

他们为什么要停下来？这位绅士今天早上在检查选票做了证词，他们知道如果让这位先生检视这些选票，他便将抽出2万、3万、4万、5万张由民主党在那段时期中伪造并提交的选票，正如你们在视频中看到的一样。这就是正在发生的事情。如果你们查看在那段时间的选票，拜登正是在那段时间获得了13万8千张票的选票优势。取掉了这个优势，谁赢得了这个州?

Let me conclude by saying something that I find people resist and maybe it’s because we’ve never faced this before.  Our founding fathers miraculously probably envisioned everything that would happen to us.  They even envisioned this a disputed election, cheating, stealing, and they made a choice.  They made a choice of where to put the responsibility in a difficult situation like that.  Article 1, section 2 of the Constitution, puts that responsibility right here in the state, in the legislatures of the several states.  You’re responsible for the selection of the electors, not the government, not your secretory of state who’s covering up everything he can cover up.  Not anybody else but you.  It’s your power.  It doesn’t come from the state constitution but comes from the United States Constitution.

最后，我要说一些人们不愿意听的话，也许是因为我们从未遇到过这种情况。我们的开国元勋们可能奇迹般地预见了会发生在我们身上的这一切。他们甚至预见到这场有争议的选举、作弊、偷窃，于是他们做出了选择。他们决定如果出现类似这样的困难局面，什么机构将负责处理。根据宪法第1条，第2节，这个责任被下放到州级，放到州的几个立法机构中。你们要对选举人的挑选负责，而不是州政府，也不是尽其所能掩盖一切的州务卿。除了你们，没有别人。这是你们的权力。它不是来自州宪法，而是来自美国国家宪法。

You’re not subjected to needing a special session.  The government has no right really to interfere with it.  He has no right to call a special session or not call a special session.  Constitution has taken him out of the process.  Constitution put the power in the state legislature so strong, but you can take that power back right up to the last moment.  You can take it back 2 minutes before the electoral votes are counted because ultimately it’s your responsibility.  You delegated it to them in the first place.  And if you feel that they’re exercising improperly, it is your obligation to stop them from doing it, and you know they exercised it improperly.  You know that.  You got so much evidence of it.

你们无需特别会议的批准。政府无权干涉。他[州务卿]无权召开或不召开特别会议。宪法将他排除在此程序外，宪法赋予州立法机构如此强大的权力，但你们可以在最后一刻收回该权力，甚至可以在选举团计票前2分钟收回权利，因为归根结底，这是你们的责任，毕竟是你们将权力委托给他们的。如果你们觉得他们执行得不正确，你们就有义务阻止他们，因为你们知道他们做得不正确。你们知道的，你们有这么多的证据。

There are 10 ways to demonstrate.  There are 10 ways to demonstrate that this election was stolen, that votes were phony, that there were a lot of them, dead people, felons, phony ballots, phony email in ballots.  How is that in every single Republican county in this state, state senators run ahead of the president by 4 – 6% every single one, exactly the same 4 – 6%.  We know the president’s favorability in this state.  We know that at least a few of those cases, he’s going to run ahead of the Republican senators.  And just so happens, it’s just in the space where they fix the vote that happened.  In other states, the president run ahead of most Republican state senators.  So, I’m tired of demonstrating it.  There are so many ways of demonstrating it.  You know it.

有10种方法来展示，有十种方法可以证明这次选举是被偷的，选票是伪造的，其中有很多是死人、罪犯、假选票、假电子邮件。为什么在这个州的每个共和党县，州参议员都领先总统4% – 6%，每个县都是4% – 6%？我们知道总统在这个州的支持率，我们知道，至少在其中的一些地方，总统会领先于共和党参议员。巧合的是，正是在这些州就发生了他们操纵投票的事件。在其它州，总统领先于大多数共和党州参议员。所以，我厌倦了证明这些。有很多方法可以证明这些，你们是知道的。

It’s a question of courage.  It’s ultimately a question of courage.  Do you have the courage to stand up to the obligation of the Constitution of the United States put on you to save our people from fraud, to save the reputation of the state of Georgia?  From, from in history, certifying a phony vote that led to the wrong result in our election, which will be the verdict of history.  Or, do you have the courage to put up with what’s going to happen if you in fact change that certification and do the right thing?  You’ll be attacked, you’ll be pilloried, you’ll be described in all sorts of horrible ways.  But you wake up the next morning, look in the mirror, and you’ll be able to say I did the right thing.  And that’s what you should be about in the public office, not worried about what people say but what you did.

这是一个勇气的问题。这归根结底是一个勇气的问题。你们是否有勇气站出来捍卫美国宪法赋予的义务？以免我们的人民遭受欺诈, 拯救佐治亚州的声誉。以历史的眼光来审视，由于认证假选票而导致错误的选举结果，将会被历史所裁决。或者，如果你们决定去改变认证，去做正确的事情，你们是否有勇气去忍受将会发生的事情？你们会被攻击，会被嘲笑，会遭受各种可怕的流言蜚语。但，当你们在第二天早上醒来时，看着镜子里的自己，你们会说我做了正确的选择。这就是你们这些行政部门的人们应该做的，不是担心别人怎么说，而是你做了什么。

And I’ll tell you another thing, your decision will stand the test in history because this is going to prove to be even worse than it is now, and it’s pretty bad.  So, I implore you to hold the session, take a vote, do the right thing, and forget the criticism.  You know what the right thing to do is.  You’ve seen the evidence of what the law is, and I implore you to do the right thing. No, no, not necessarily for President Trump although he is my client, your client, but now it has really become much bigger than that.  For the American people, and so to stops, right now!  No more of this stuff in America.  This is the stuff you do in a third world country.  We let him get away with this, it can get much worse. And I can’t say enough about your courage.  You Mr. Chairman and the other members of your committee in doing what a lot of others are afraid to do.  And I thank you on behalf of my client, and on behalf of the United States.  Thank you!

我要再告诉你们一件事，你们的决定将经受住历史的考验，因为未来将被证明比现在更糟糕，而且非常糟糕。所以，我恳求你举行会议，投票，做正确的事，不要去管被人说什么。你们知道正确的做法是什么。你们已经知道法律是怎么回事。我恳求你们做正确的选择。这不一定是针对川普总统，虽然他是我的客户，你们的客户，但现在这件事的意义却真的是很大。为了美国人民，现在就停止吧！美国不应该再有这种事发生，这是那些第三世界国家干的事情。如果我们这次让它逍遥法外，今后事情会变得更糟。我已经无法对你们的勇气再多说什么了。主席先生，您和您的委员会的其他成员做了许多其他人不敢做的事情，我代表我的委托人，也代表整个美国感谢您。谢谢您！

Thank you being here, we appreciate your time!

谢谢您来到这里！感谢您的宝贵时间！
