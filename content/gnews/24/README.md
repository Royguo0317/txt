英文標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep223:  Chinese police hunted for the South Mongolian students, arrested them and took them to school

视频重点

1. 內蒙古中小學生新學期於9月1日正式開學，中共當局施壓利誘且發佈各種強制命令，但連日來絕大多數家長拒絕送子女上學，各地蒙古學校教室空蕩蕩。同時中共當局安排其它族學生身穿蒙古袍上學，製造蒙古族學生上課的假新聞。
2. 中共員警四處追捕蒙古族學生，抓他們回去上課。蒙古語教學事件中23人遭通緝。
3. 內蒙古呼和浩特師範大學附中，學生集體抗議。學生抗議活動得到在場民眾支持。
4. 中共內蒙古政府檔案：中共黨員或公職人員的子女罷課就懲治家長。這是中共以黑治國的證據之一。
5. （9/1）昨天很多戰友給我打電話，蒙古的戰友。這兩天當我們看到蒙古的孩子被給弄在學校的時候。我們都在學校長大的。看到那些孩子竟然被關在學校裏不讓回家，你說這個世界有多瘋狂。你看看在新疆幹的事兒、西藏幹的事兒、台灣幹的事兒、香港幹的事兒、在美國DOJ的文件幹的事兒、在歐洲幹的事兒、在非洲幹的事兒，你能看出來共產黨想幹啥。就和1932年到1946年的德國希特勒完全一樣。


1. The new school year started on September 1st in South Mongolia. Although the Chinese government has issued various coercive orders with intimidation and inducement, most of parents refused to send their children to school, which made the school deserted.
2. Chinese police hunted for the South Mongolian students, arrested them and took them to class. Over 23 people are wanted in the Mongolian Language Teaching Incident.
3. In South Mongolia, students protested at the secondary school of Hohhot Normal University, which gained support from the public.
4. News revealed from the document of the South Mongolia Government of the CCP: Punishment will be imposed to CCP Members or Public Officials whose children invovled in strike for school.  This is one of the evidences of blackmail from CCP’s dictatorship ruling the country.
5. (9/1) Yesterday, many brothers and sisters called me from Inner Mongolia. In recent days we saw kids there getting locked up in school. We all grew up going to school. Look at those kids, locked up on campus, not allowed to go home. What a crazy world. Look at CCP’s deeds in Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong, as written in the DOJ file, and in Europe and Africa. From these, you can see what the CCP want to do. Exactly the same as Nazi Germany in 1932-1946.
