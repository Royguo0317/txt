**知道中共有解药以后西方该怎么办****  ****习近平已经众叛亲离**

**Knowing There Is an Antidote, How Should We Go Forward Next?**

那么另外一个我想和大家说的事情，就是昨天在我盖特发出以后，[我爆出了]共产党有解药。[共产党]有解药这件事情可以说在世界上[是]重大重大的一张[灭共牌]，[是]重磅的一则爆料，影响[深远]。

So another thing that I want to share with everybody is that yesterday I posted my Getter video that exposed the fact that the CCP has an antidote. We can say that the fact that the CCP has an antidote can be used as a major card [in taking down the CCP]. It’s like a bombshell dropped and it will have a profound impact.

所有真正有正事、有良知的[人]，知道冠状病毒[的情况]了解共产党的西方官员，他说为什么全世界人就没想过这个问题呢？他说你爆出这个问题太重要了。昨天我和亚洲的某个国家连线，人家对方就说：“郭先生，我们没有任何怀疑你的意思。我们应该怎么往前走？”

Like all people in the West who are righteous, who have a conscience, who know about the coronavirus, and who understand the CCP, this guy asked, “Why hasn’t anybody in the world even thought about this?” He said that the stuff that I exposed is really important. Yesterday I connected with people from a certain country in Asia, and they said: “Mr. Guo, we don’t have any doubts about what you said, but how should we go forward?”

我说：“非常简单，你先定义这个[病毒]是不是自然的，不是自然的那就是人造的。[如果是]人造[的，那是]谁造的？大家现在怀疑唯一的[罪魁祸首]就是中国共产党。为啥共产党里面有人戴口罩有人不戴口罩？为什么共产党的老百姓死了上百万人武汉老百姓？为什么这些高官的家人一个不死？[事情]就这么简单。”

I said, “Very simple. First you define whether this virus is natural or not. If not, then it is man-made. If it is man-made, who made it? The only one suspected by everybody is the CCP. Why do some members of the CCP wear masks and some don’t? Why have millions of common people in Wuhan in communist China died but none of these high-ranking officials’ family have? That’s how simple it is.”

“那么现在共产党如果说没有解药，那请让他[共产党]告诉你所有参与研究武汉实验室的任何工程师，让他[们]到美国和欧洲来接受质询。别说审判，质询他[们]。让他[们]告诉你怎么找到[冠状病毒的]解药，行不行？或者你们美国欧洲不敢跟共产党要真相，[那就跟共产党]要[冠状病毒的]解药呗。说你给解药我[们就]不追究你责任了，这不也挺好吗，对吧？也挺好啊。”

I continued, “So if the CCP replies that they have no antidote, you then ask them to tell you who the engineers involved in the research in the Wuhan lab are, then let them come to the US and Europe to receive questions at hearing. Don’t call it trials, call it hearings. Let them tell you how to find the antidote, okay? Or if you, the US and Europe, dare not ask the CCP for the truth about the virus, you can just ask for the antidote. Tell them that if they agree to give the antidote, you won’t hold them accountable. Isn’t it nice, right? It will be pretty nice.”

所以说现在这个[冠状病毒]解药的问题引起了世界上的巨大震撼。

So now this antidote thing has greatly shocked the world.

兄弟姐妹们，连我本人在48小时以前，我[都]从来没想过这个世界上会有[冠状病毒的]解药。我[之前]通过各种内部参与爆料[革命]的人[了解]，都给我一句话：“不可能有疫苗，因为这是人造的生化病毒，怎么可能有疫苗呢？这是个基本常识，而且每个[病毒]都在变异中。”直到他告诉我说：“文贵，我可以告诉你，没那么悲观。只要西方世界有正义的力量和正义的良知的人，这个世界是有解药的。”

Brothers and sisters, even I myself had never thought that there could be an antidote existing in this world like 48 hours ago. Previously I heard the same answer from different fellow fighters of the Whistleblower Movement: “There can’t be any vaccines, because this is a man-made bioweapon virus. How can there be a vaccine? This is basic common sense. Besides, this virus keeps mutating.” Until this guy told me: “Miles, I can tell you, it’s not so hopeless. As long as there are righteous people with a conscience in the western world, there will be antidotes in this world.”

我当时就傻了，我说：“你在开什么玩笑啊？怎么可能？生化病毒怎么[可能]有解药？”他说：“生化病毒只要是研究者当初把它当成病毒了，它就有解药。”然后给我讲了这个过程。[听完]我傻了。但是我也觉的这是个巨大的希望，[随后]我[把这个消息]第一个先告诉了我身边的最重要的一个替我把关这方面情报的科学的一个助理。我说：“你马上到你们某[机构]找这些人研究研究，[看看]这话是否可靠？”[得到的]答案是：他是对的！

I was frozen on the spot, I said, “Are you kidding me? How could it be possible? How can a bioweapon virus has an antidote?” He said, “As long as the researchers of a bioweapon virus treated it as a virus when they developed it, there should be an antidote.” Then he explained the process to me. I was stunned. But I also felt that this could be a great hope. Then I forwarded this information to the most important assistant who has been helping me with verifying intelligence in the science field right away. I said: “Could you find people in your [institution] to research on this and find out whether the information is reliable or not?” The answer I got is: He is right!

然后我又经过核实，特别是他说的国内所谓的中央政治局、中央常委2020年所谓的《工作方式的重要提要》，重要提要。就因为这个问题现在，大家记住啊习[近平]身边没人啦。韩正不行了，本来也不怎么行；栗战书也靠边站了；丁薛祥也靠边站了，大家看到了吗？王沪宁也靠边站了，大家看到了吗？现在就剩下仨人，严格讲四个人[是习信任的]：他弟弟习远平，然后军方的许其亮，[习近平对]许其亮最近也半信半疑，[对许也很]恼火。完全剩下[信任]杨娘娘[杨洁篪]，王太监[王毅]，王太监[王毅]。

Then I verified again, especially on what he said about the so-called “Important Synopsis of Working Methods” by the so-called Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the Central Standing Committee in 2020, or “Important Synopsis” for short. Please remember this: Exactly because of this [Important Synopsis], Xi Jinping has lost everyone around him. Han Zheng is over (he hasn’t been trusted anyway); Li Zhanshu also stepped aside; Ding Xuexiang also stepped aside, have you seen it? Wang Huning also stepped aside, have you seen it? Now there are only three people left. Strictly speaking, there are four people [that Xi trusts]: his younger brother Xi Yuanping, then Xu Qiliang from the military, but Xu Qiliang has become suspicious and annoying in Xi’s eyes recently. So this only leaves Concubine Yang (Yang JieChi) and Eunuch Wang (Wang Yi) that he still trusts.

所以说你看兄弟姐妹们，这杨娘娘[杨洁篪]、王公公[王毅]两人和习大神还得隔着个门指挥许其亮，还有个弟弟习远平。这共产党还有未来吗？听说就这个开会的形式把大家全[吓]傻了，也就是给不给谁解药的问题，不是说你家人要解药[就给你]。听说韩正要给家人要一些解药犯大忌了。你[韩正]想干什么？你[韩正]想干什么？嗯？

So brothers and sisters, you can see that the Great God Xi can only command Xu Qiliang indirectly through Concubine Yang, Eunuch Wang Xi, and Xi Yuanping. So is there still hope for the CCP? I heard that the situation in the meeting really scared everyone, particularly, surrounding the question of whom to give the antidote. It’s not like you can request the antidote for anyone in your family. I heard that Han Zheng asked for some antidote for his family and this really touched the red line, making Xi think: “What do you want to do, Han Zheng?”

这个解药啊，最后拿解药的人你一定记住：想要解药的人一定把拿解药的人弄死。这就是七哥在爆料[病毒]一出[现]，[刚]开始的时候就说过，[解药]叫“人尸丸”。看看那江湖上，那个什么任老妖[任我行]弄得泡的“人尸丸”。是不是啊？东邪西毒，吃下去用人尸体做的这个“人尸丸”，吃了以后你想再活？那就继续吃我“人尸丸”，必须听我的。这就[是]世界的“人尸丸”，你咋弄啊？苍天在上，啊苍天呐，苍天呐。

Regarding this antidote, those who eventually got the antidote must remember this: those who want the antidote must kill those who have got the antidote. This is like what I, your Brother Miles said at the very beginning of the pandemic, the antidote is called the “zombie pill”. The zombie pill is like what the old demon Ren Woxing (a figure in a martial arts novel) cooked, isn’t it? If those who have taken this zombie pill want to live, they have to continue to take the pills, so they must listen to the master. So this virus antidote is like the modern world version of the zombie pill. What do we do? Heavens, please have mercy on us!

所以现在共产党现在乱了，从我发出那个盖特[之后]。我让大家简单看一下啊，大家就简单[看一下]，[可]别暴露信息啊，我别爆露信息啊。你看我简单[说一下]，每一个小时三千多个[信息]，每一个小时啊，每一个小时。国内很多战友，体制内的战友纷纷爆料：“七哥，这个[病毒解药]太重要，你说对了！看看中央警卫局，中央警卫局还有八一大楼什么人戴口罩什么人不戴口罩？”

Since I posted that Getter video, the CCP has been in chaos. I’ll let you guys take a look at it quickly, hoping not to reveal any private information. Simply put, I received more than 3,000 messages per hour. That’s per hour, per hour! Many fellow fighters in mainland China within the party system told me: “Brother Miles, this information is so important! You’re right! Look at the Central Guard Bureau, the Central Guard Bureau and the Eight-One Building and see who wears masks and who doesn’t.”
