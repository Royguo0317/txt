`2020-08-18 09:59 GM62` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hant/301679/)

重點中文: 
1. 8月9日上海新增18例冠狀病毒感染者，中共卻甩鍋給從外歸國人員。 就像六月一樣，竟然將冠狀病毒嫁禍於進口的三文魚。 
2. 北京“隨手拍”交通違法舉報APP正式上線。 鼓勵市民舉報交通違法行為。 挑起群眾之間矛盾，轉移對政府的不滿。 文革2.0全面開啟。 
3. 8月9日 內蒙古草原突發被巨型龍捲風襲擊，傷者在醫院進行治療,150頂蒙古包被損壞。 沒看到政府及時處理，百姓的納稅錢都用去哪裡了？ 
4. 8月9日美國衛生與公眾服務部部長 亞歷克斯·阿紮爾，會見了台灣總統蔡英文，台灣和美國將雙方關係塑造為基於「共同的民主價值觀」上的盟友。 
5. 閆麗夢博士: 我們分析了冠狀病毒的基因組,並找到了證明。 病毒絕對不是來自自然，而是在實驗室通過技術改造過的。

1. August 9, 18 new cases in Shanghai. However, it is reported by CCP that the cause was from people returning from abroad. Just like in June the coronavirus was blamed on imported salmon by CCP.
2. Beijing “Shoot at any time” APP is online, to encourage citizens to report traffic violations. Arouse the masses to fight each other to transfer dissatisfaction with government. Cultural Revolution version 2.0 is started.
3. Huge tornados emerged over grasslands in Inner Mongolia, injured were  in hospital, 150 yurts were damaged. But without timely response from government. Where did they spend the taxes that people paid? 
4. August 9, Alex Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Taiwan and U.S have shaped their relationship as allies based on “common democratic values.” 
5. Virologist Dr. Li-meng Yan:  we analyzed the genome of COVID-19 and seized the evidence, it’s definitely not coming from nature but been modified in the lab. It’s based on the PLA-owned(CCP) Zhoushan bat coronavirus.
