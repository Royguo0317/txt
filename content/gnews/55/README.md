在2021年3月15日的盖特视频中，郭先生说1月20日之前国务卿蓬佩奥并没有打算离开国务院；1月13日，中美之间在台湾的大战几乎一触即发，美国许多军事行动也已准备就绪，但是，台湾却临阵退缩，川普总统遂在最后一刻取消了行动，并且给拜登写了一封长长的信，主动移交权力。否则，中共现在已经被推翻！

**郭先生首爆料：今年一月中美之战在台湾几乎一触即发**

**The US and China Almost Went to A War in Taiwan Before Jan 20**

请大家想一想，包括到了一月初，美国政府公布，联合国克拉夫特要访问美国内阁成员，要访问台湾。没多少人讲清楚这事。七哥得搂住，七哥得搂住。现在很多人都说，都已经报道了，美国的各种政治网站，美国的CNN，美国的布劳迪克都已经报道出来了，大家也都知道了，包括Breitbart也都出来了，我可以说说啊。第二个大家不要忘了，记住我说的话，到一月，就是1.20前，1月16号我做梦啊，我梦见和蓬佩奥联系，蓬佩奥还没有任何说离开国务院的准备。大家知道为什么？ 我告诉大家。

Do you recall in early January, the U.S. government announced that its Ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, was going to visit Taiwan? A Cabinet member of the U.S. government was going to visit Taiwan, which few people were able to decipher thoroughly. Although I received the information, I could not tell you in advance. Now, many people told me, now that several U.S. newspapers and political websites have already reported it, including CNN and Politico, and people have already been aware of what happened, and Breitbart’s report is out too, so I may talk about what I know now. Also, please don’t forget what I told you around January 20. It was on January 16 that I had a dream. I dreamed that I contacted Pompeo, but he was not ready to leave the State Department at all. Do you know why? Let me tell you.

1月13号那天几乎是中美开战。克拉夫特的飞机在天上，C40B已经在天上，都已经走了，准备去台湾了。日本基地的军队已经全部准备好了，中间所有的海上行线，海里、天上，就是美国外交官出行的护卫，安全保护已经全开始了。而且在日本，在南海的舰队、航空母舰都已经做好了准备，去访问台湾，那肯定军机护航嘛，美国军机护航，那所有的就近的航空母舰，这是美国的一个基本装备，就像我回家一样，外面外保、中保、内保、家里保卫，它一定是通知到位。你看着没啥，它一定是外中内嘛，它一定是这样的，是吧？还有变装的。他们一样，海、空中、亚洲，经过欧洲，这几个区域的军队，它都在防护中嘛，这是一场重大的军事行动，准军事行动，国家行动。

On January 13, the U.S. and China almost went to a war. The C40B aircraft that Kelly Craft was boarded had already taken off and was ready to fly to Taiwan on that day. The Japanese military bases were fully prepared. All relevant sea routes, air routes, escort, and security measures for U.S. diplomats’ traveling had been activated. The U.S. fleet in Japan and the South China Sea, and the U.S. aircraft carriers were ready to visit Taiwan. These were the U.S. military aircrafts to conduct the escort mission. All the nearby aircraft carriers had to be in position. This is a routine procedure. It is like all the security measures taken when I go home. The perimeter security, the middle circle security, the inner circle security, and inside security must be notified and be ready. You may not notice anything special, but all the security bodyguards are ready. In addition, there are also some bodyguards in plain clothes. All their military operations are conducted in a similar pattern. In Asia and throughout Europe, the navy and air forces were standing by for defense. It was a major military, paramilitary, and international operation.

这时候共产党，这个真的是打电话了，就给你通报，不是跟你商量，明确告诉你，来自于中共中央，军委习大神主席，明确告诉你：“只要是你敢军机进台，我的军机就进台；你航空母舰靠台，我就靠台；你开火，我就开火，台湾开火，我就开火。”

Then the CCP called, saying, “I am just calling to inform you, not to discuss with you.” What followed were the loud and clear words from their Central Military Commission Chairman, God Xi (Xi Jinping): “If any U.S. military aircraft dares to approach Taiwan, our military aircrafts would do it too. If the U.S. aircraft carriers dare to dock in Taiwan, we would do the same. If either the U.S. or Taiwanese opens fire, the PLA would immediately counterattack.”

大家不知道，最后是什么？美国并没有退，美国人说：“那就干吧，去吧。”大家都知道，蓬佩奥还有川普总统要的就是这一刻，那怎么办啊？是台湾退了，台湾说：“我求求啊！求求啊！美大神，习大神，你俩都别打了，你看我一个孤家寡人的，我多害怕啊，我台湾经不起折腾啊，我求求别来了！”就这，最后是台湾左求爹，右求娘，求了半天：“你俩别打了，赶快走，你俩我谁也惹不了，再不行我就钻地道去了。”然后美国知道了，中共是真正做好要打仗的准备，是美军最后报给了川普总统，还有国务院。说只要过去，肯定打，100%。最后一分钟谁取消的？川普总统取消的，川普总统取消的，蓬佩奥是绝对不取消的，干吧。没有人知道。

Do you know what happened in the end? The U.S. didn’t back down. They said, “Fine, then let’s do it.” Secretary Pompeo and President Trump were waiting for this moment. What happened then? It turned out that Taiwan backed down, and they begged, “Please, American Lord and God Xi, please stop fighting. Can’t you see how scared I am? Taiwan can’t afford a war, and I beg you not to come.” That was it. Taiwan was begging for mercy from both sides, “Please don’t fight or come. We can’t afford to make either of you unhappy. If you insist on coming, then I will have to drill an underground tunnel and hide.” At that moment, the U.S. realized that the CCP was indeed prepared for a war. In the end, the U.S. military reported to President Trump and the State Department that if the U.S. military went to Taiwan, a hundred percent, there would be a war. Who called it off in the last minute? It was President Trump. Pompeo would never call it off because he was ready for a battle. Few people know this.

我梦见的，我做梦梦见的，我完全是胡扯的。还有道听途说的，我梦见的，就最后那两天，蓬佩奥没有做出离开国务院的准备，是川普总统写了一封热情洋溢的信，给了拜登：“我最后做了什么决定，把权力给你……”很长，可不是那几句话，什么 “Joe, 你知道，我赢了，I’m winner。” 不是这样，这是假的，未来你们会看到，长长的信，等于是川普总统让路给了,他最后只要是决定，一签，“啪”结束了。

You may think that what I am telling you was all in my dreams, all nonsense [and it is up to you to believe it or not]. Just two days before [January 20] – hearsay or just a dream I had – Pompeo still hadn’t prepared to leave the State Department. Finally, it was President Trump who wrote a passionate, long letter to Biden, “I finally made a decision… I am transferring the power to you…” It was inaccurate that he wrote, “Joe, you know I won. I am the winner.” Maybe someday, this letter will be released. It was President Trump who took the initiative to transfer the power to Biden. If he had signed the order related to Taiwan, the CCP would have been taken down instantly.
