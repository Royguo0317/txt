## 前国务卿蓬佩奥在2021年CPAC大会上讲话（中英对照）
` 喜马拉雅玫瑰园小队` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/951527/)

这是前国务卿蓬佩奥在离任后的首次在CPAC发表精彩演讲。在2月27日的演讲中，他充满深情地回忆了自己的祖父与母亲，生动地诉说了他那诚实、勤劳，敢于面对一切困难的、正派的家庭，对他人格的形成所起的巨大作用。

蓬佩奥向听众呈现了他与川普政府四年来的一些主要成就，其中包括美国协助以色列在中东地区所实现的和平进程。他也提到了与精英建制派们的分歧，并用事实告诉大家，只有面对邪恶能勇敢地站起来时，才能确保美国得之不易的自由，才能为世界争取和平。

最后，他以美国特种兵种中对优秀军人对口头禅“管道修理工”来鼓励在座的所有人，鼓励大家在各行各业都秉持“管道修理工”精神，排除万难，将不可能的事情变为可能。

**Fmr. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Speech at CPAC**

**前国务卿迈克·庞培在CPAC上的讲话**

Thank you for that warm greeting! It’s always a blessing and a little bit unnerving to have your son at the podium. Look, I look out here and I see you all. I feel really at home and thank you for that.

谢谢你们的热情问候！让您的儿子能走上讲台总是件幸事但也有一点点揣揣不安。我从这里放眼望去，看到在场所有的人，我有宾至如归之感。谢谢你们！

Last year, I came here as an America’s 70 secretary state, President Trump’s Secretary of State. And before that, I was here as a member of Congress from South Central Kansas. Yeah, go Kansas. But this is different. This time is different. In the last few months, we’ve been called clowns and deplorable and ignorant rednecks. We’ve been called evil resistance.

去年，我是作为第70任美国国务卿，以川普总统的国务卿身份来到这里，在此之前我是来自堪萨斯州中南部的国会议员。是的，堪萨斯加油！但是现在却不一样了，这次不一样了。在刚过去的那几个月里，我们被称为小丑、可怜而无知的红脖子乡巴佬，我们被称为邪恶的抵抗者。

The New York Time thinks I’m the worst secretary of state of all time. Yeah. Since I last saw you, the Chinese have sanctioned me. The Iranians don’t think so much of me either, but I’m proud of our fight and I’m proud of our accomplishments and we have truly upended the status quo. We’ve demonstrated enormous resistance. Resistance to socialism, to the woke cancel culture. I’ll talk about that.

《纽约时报》说我是有史以来最差的国务卿。是的，自从上次见到你们，中共国又对我进行制裁,伊朗人对我也很不以为然，但我为我们的战斗感到骄傲，为我们的成就感到自豪。我们真的扭转了局面，我们展现出了无比强大的抵抗力。我们抵制社会主义，抵制所谓的觉醒者取消文化，下面我会讲到这一点。

We resisted seeing our liberty and our freedoms slipping away. This is noble worthy fight, and we’re in it. We fought hard. We fought for heart on nearly every front, and we will always fight for it. I remember when they were calling us disruptors and said they were against the establishment. We said, “Of course.”

我们不能眼睁睁地看着我们的自由和权利在消逝。这是一场崇高且值得我们去进行的战斗，我们正参与其中，我们浴血奋战，我们几乎在每条战线上都为心灵而战，我们将永远为之而战。我记得他们说我们是颠覆者，并说他们反对建制派。我们说“当然了。”

Now I want to tell the story. I think I come by this disruption and shooting straight very naturally. And in the Pompeo family, I’ve been compared to my grandpa. His name was Earl, Earl Mercer.  Now, Grandpa Earl always said what was on his mind. He was pretty rough cut, Kansas. He worked hard. He never won a Mr. Congeniality contest, even in Mitchell County.

下面我想讲一个故事，我想我天生就有这种铁头和直话直说的性格。在蓬佩奥家族，我曾被拿来与我的外祖父相比较，他叫厄尔，厄尔•默瑟。外祖父厄尔总是心里想什么就说什么，他是个粗犷的堪萨斯人，他非常勤奮地工作。即使是在米切尔县，他也从未赢得过「人气先生」竞赛。

But when the going was tough, you wanted Grandpa Earl around. In the 1930s, Grandpa Earl was the sheriff of Mitchell Country, Kansas. Population today, a little bit less than 6500.

但在困难时期，你希望有祖父厄尔在你身边。在20世紀30年代，外祖父厄尔是堪萨斯州米切尔县的一个警长，今天该县人口不到6500人。

My mother Dorothy was one of Earl’s and Grace’s 10 kids. I had an Uncle Richard. He was the last of the lot and he was going to run for reelection as sheriff. And Richard decided that there was good money. There was really good money in homemade gin. So he built a still in the basement bedroom. Everything was good, but the campaign and the bootleg business, all good. Until a still exploded in the basement. It blew up the basement and the campaign.

我的母亲多罗西是厄尔和葛蕾丝10个孩子中的一个，我的舅舅理查德是最小一个，他打算竞选警长连任。理查德认为在家里酿造杜松子酒会很赚钱，所以他在家庭地下室的卧室里建了个蒸馏器。一切都很顺利，无论是竞选活动还是违禁的酒生意都很好，直到地下室的蒸馏器发生了爆炸。它炸毁了地下室，把竞选活动也搞砸了。

Grandpa Earl was a one-term sheriff in Mitchell County. He moved his family to a little further South to where he raised my mother in Wellington, where he opened a pool hall. How’s that for going from Sheriff to the pool hall operator? Best chill in Kansas.

外祖父厄尔在米切尔县只干了一任警长，他将全家搬到稍南边一点的地方，在惠灵顿扶养了我母亲，并在那里开了一家台球厅。从一个警长变成台球厅的操作员，那是何种感觉？堪萨斯州最好的辣椒酱。

I tell this story because I think there’s a couple things that we, those of us who believe, those of us who’ve been part of the conservative movement for so long can learn from this.

我讲这个故事是因为我认为有两件事情，是我们，我们这些有坚定信念的，我们这些长期参与保守运动的人们可以从中学到的。

First, he was a great sheriff and he was regarded as such because he never tried to be anything he wasn’t. He was never afraid to tell people the truth. He did what the people of Mitchell Country expected of him. He respected them.

首先， 他是一个很棒的警长。人们之所以这么认为，是因为他从来不想成为其他人而只做自己。他从不害怕告诉人们真相，他做了米切尔县人民对他期望的事情。他尊重他们。

Second lesson from the gin problem is the plans change, things happen. We don’t always see it going exactly the way we want, but we should never give up. We should always be true to ourselves and we will succeed at all of it if we do.

从杜松子酒中学到的第二教训是计划不如变化。事情并不总是能按照我们的意愿去发展，但我们永远都不应该放弃，我们应该对自己诚实，这样我们就能在所有事情上取得成功。

Grandpa Earl knew too that facts mattered.  So today, I’m going to arm you with some facts, some accomplishments from these past four years,  how we protected every one of you and our great Bill of Rights at every turn.

祖父厄尔也知道只有事实才是重要的，所以今天，我将向你们提供一些事实和过去四年的一些成就。我们是如何处处保护你们每一个人的，以及我们伟大的《权利法案》。

And what’s good news today for me is when you’re a diplomat, when you’re the 72nd secretary of state, you have to stay in your lane. I don’t have that. I’m not a diplomat.  I’m going to let it rip.

而今天对我来说，好消息是，当你是一个外交官时，当你是第72任国务卿时，你不能越雷池一步。然而现在我没有了这个约束，不再是外交官了，让那些捆绑见鬼去吧。

So look, where did we begin?  We began with you. We begin with workers all across America we put back to work.

那么，让我们来看看我们该从哪里开始？就从你们开始,从让全美国的劳动者们重新就业开始。

We put back to work women. We put back to work African-Americans, Asians, Hispanics, everyone. Everyone was back working. We did that. President Trump did that. Our team understood that this matters. We focused on the economy that put Americans back to work.

我们为妇女们、非裔美国人、亚裔美国人、西裔美国人，为所有人创造工作机会。我们做到过，川普总统做到过。我们的团队明白那一点是至关重要的。我们专注于让美国人回到工作岗位的经济

We did it by also securing our borders, giving Americans the chance to make a good wage and a chance to take care of their families. And we also… I’m from Kansas, don’t forget. We built American energy jobs too. We rolled back regulations on job careers, and we wanted everyone to take risks and grow their business and create opportunity for people all across America.

我们做到了这一点是通过保护我们的边境，让美国人有机会获得更好的工资，有时间照顾他们的家人；同时我们也……别忘了，我来自堪萨斯州，我们也创造了美国的能源就业机会，我们取消了对职业生涯的条条框框，我们鼓励每个人都有冒险的精神去开拓自己的业务，为全美国人民创造机会。

I heard this time and time again. I remember I ran for Congress in 2010, when President Obama was in office. Employers and workers had both lost confidence. We restored that confidence. They knew we had their back. We knew we’d support them, not burden them. We wanted them to be successful.

我多次听到这样的话，记得我在2010年竞选国会议员，当时是奥巴马总统任期，雇主和雇员们都对美国失去了信心，我们恢复了这份信心。他们知道我们会支持他们，我们也确信我们会支持他们，而不是给他们增加负担。我们希望他们成功。

The hallmark of our work here in America was that we were bold and fearless. And what I hear today, I hear Democrats pretend they care about jobs in America. But before the seats were warm in the oval office, they destroyed 10,000 jobs in a pipeline. And I see to my predecessor’s predecessor, green geek, John Kerry, right? He thinks these folks are all going to go make solar panels. I’ll tell you what, you ask the good people of midland Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, or South Dakota, Pennsylvania.

在美国，我们工作的特征就是勇敢无畏。而我今天听到民主党人假装关心美国的就业，然而（拜登团队）在白宫还没坐热之前，他们就已经毁掉了输油管道行业中的1万个工作岗位。我看到了我的前任「环保书呆子」约翰•克里，对吗？他认为这些人都将去制造太阳能电池板。好吧，你们得去问问得克萨斯州中部地区、俄克拉荷马州、堪萨斯州、或南达科他州，和宾夕法尼亚州的人们。

You think petroleum engineers and rig hands are going to go out and make solar panels? No, and you can bet this too. Those cheap Chinese solar panels will start flooding into America like you have not seen. And this won’t be good for the United States of America.

你们认为石油工程师和钻井工会去生产太阳能电池板吗？不，你们也可以为此打赌。那些廉价的中国太阳能电池板将会风涌而入美国市场，这将是你们从未见过的。这对美利坚合众国没有好处。

Don’t get me wrong. Sometimes we get accused, say we don’t care about the environment. We create jobs that destroy the environment. That’s just not true. We simply didn’t do it. We didn’t protect the environment on the backs of American workers. There were more job openings than people looking for work for much of these past four years. It was an amazing accomplishment

请不要误解我的话，有时我们会被指责，说我们不关心环境，说我们创造了破坏环境的就业机会。那完全不是事实。我们只是不要那么做，我们只是不要把美国工人踩在脚下来保护环境。在过去四年的大部分时间里，职位空缺比求职人数还多，这是一个惊人的成就。

And when the Chinese wanted to come steal your job, we just said no way. 40 years, bipartisan, Democrat and Republican, 40 years of failure letting made in China crush us was going to stop. We demanded fair and reciprocal trade. Never forget too, China depends more for us than we do on them.

当中国人想要窃取你们的工作时，我们直接说不可以。40年来的两党，民主党和共和党，40年来两党的失败让“中国制造”压垮了我们，这必须停止。我们要求公平和互惠的贸易，别忘了中国对我们的依赖比我们对它们的依赖更大。

President Trump understood that, our foreign policy understood that, and we protected the American worker from the Chinese Communist Party’s predation on us here in America. Now, my job often took me overseas. We protected our freedom abroad.

川普总统理解这一点，我们的外交政策也体现出这一点。我们保护了美国工人免受中共在美国的掠夺。那么，我经常会因工作的原因出国，在国外我们也保护我们的自由。

We kind of did it like Grandpa Earl did. We were honest, hardworking. We treated the world as it is, not as we wished it were. We weren’t going to live in fantasy land.

就像我的祖父厄尔那样，我们是诚实的，勤劳的。我们尊重现实，接受世界的现状，我们没有生活在一厢情愿的幻想中。

I will tell you, I walked out of some very quiet rooms in Europe. We had a restrained foreign policy, but when the time came, when the situation so required, we led. We came hard. We came heavy. I sent messages repeatedly to bad guys around the world that if you touch an American, you’ll pay dearly.

让我告诉你们吧，在欧洲我曾从一些非常安静的谈判屋里走出，我们的外交政策曾是克制的，可一旦需要，一旦形势需要时，我们便发挥领导作用，我们难以对付，我们行动猛烈。我反复向世界各地的坏人发出信号，如果你们胆敢伤害一个美国人，你们便将会付出沉重的代价。

Now, we all know that strength deters bad guys, weakness begets war. And we want to stay out of wars. And we did.

那么我们都知道，只有力量能震慑坏人，软弱只会引发战争。我们希望远离战争，我们做到了。

I was with the president, so many trips and he would tell his counterparts across the world. He would say, look, I’m going to put America first as the President of United States. And I expect you will put your country and your people first and we’ll work together and accomplish this for both of our countries. And we did that.

我和总统在一起有过很多次旅行，他告诉世界各地的领导人，他说：「我是把美国放在第一位的美国总统，我希望你们也把自己的国家和人民放在首位，让我们共同努力，为我们的国家去实现这一目标。」我们做到了这一点。

America first is right for America. It’s right for each of us. America first secures our freedom and the entire world benefits when America is fearless and bold and strong.

「美国优先」对美国来说是正确的。对我们每个人来说也是正确的，美国首先要确保我们的自由。当美国无所畏惧、勇敢和强大时，全世界都会受益。

We just tick through a few waves. Right? So first, we show The Paris Climate Accord was a job destroying joke. So we said [French“Au devoir” ].

我们只是经历了一些波折，对吗？首先，巴黎气候协议是一个破坏工作机会的笑话，所以我们就很有风度地说：「再见」（法语）

Look, we all want clean air, safe drinking water. But the Paris agreement was a fantasy for elite diplomats who just wanted to virtue signal. And when President Biden re-entered this deal, I can tell you that Xi Jinping was smiling every single minute. And the American workers lost.

我们都想要干净的空气，安全的饮用水，但巴黎协议只是精英外交官们的一个幻想而已，他们只是想传递一个光勉堂皇的信号而已。当总统拜登重新签署这项协议时，我可以告诉你们，习近平每分钟都在笑，而美国的工人却输掉了。

We too spent a lot of time. We defended America in the Middle East and we defended Israel in the Middle East too. We were told a number of things, right? This was what establishment foreign policy is. You were told that you can’t sanction the Ayatollah in Iran and you can’t stop sending pallets of cash to the leadership. There’ll be a war. Well, we did. And there wasn’t a war.

我们也花了很多时间（在有关和平的议题上），我们捍卫美国和以色列在中东地区的利益，我们被告知了很多事情。对吧？这是建制派的外交政策。它告知你不能制裁伊朗的阿亚图拉，不能停止给领导层送现金，否则会有一场战争。好吧，我们做到了，而且没有发生战争。

We were told you can’t move the United States embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. There’ll be a war. Well, we did. And there was not a war.

我们被告知不能把美国驻以色列大使馆搬到耶路撒冷，否则会有一场战争。我们做到了，也没有发生战争。

We were told you can’t allow Israel to have its rights in Judea and Samaria and the Golan Heights. There’ll be war. We did that. We righted that and there was no war.

我们被告知不能允许以色列在犹太、撒玛利亚和戈兰高地享有权利，否则会有战争。我们又做到了。我们纠正了这个说法，并且没有发生战争。

We were told, and this was believed for an awful long time, that you can’t secure peace in the region, in the Middle East, between Arab nations and Israel, without buying off Palestinian kleptocrats. You’ll create World War III, but we did.

我们被告知，而且在很长一段时间里都被误导，如果不收买巴勒斯坦的贪官污吏就不可能在中东地区，在阿拉伯国家和以色列之间确保和平，因为那将引起第三次世界大战。对此我们不予理睬。

The Abraham Accords forged a real peace in the Middle East. The Abraham Accords rewrote decades of failed shuttle negotiations, because we were willing to go against the elites of the foreign policy establishment, left and right to secure American freedom and to champion your values.

《亚伯拉罕协议》让我们在中东促成了真正的和平，《亚伯拉罕协议》扭转了数十年频繁的、失败的谈判结果。因我们敢于与左派和右派制定外交政策的精英们对抗以确保美国自由，并捍卫你们的价值观。

It’s unfortunate. Looks like the new Team Biden appears to be headed back into appeasing Iran. This will be a disaster for the United States of America and a disaster for the region as well.

很不幸，看起来拜登的新团队似乎又要去安抚伊朗了。这将是美国的灾难，也是整个地区的灾难。

I remember too, President Trump sent me to Pyongyang when I was a CIA director to meet with Chairman Kim, to prepare for the historic summit that was ultimately held in Singapore. You all remember this?

我还记得，在我担任中央情报局局长期间，川普总统派我去平壤与金正恩主席会面，为最终在新加坡举行的历史性峰会做准备。你们都记得这个吧？

We threatened fire and fury. We threatened fire and fury not to go to war, but to deter it. And deter it, we did.

我们表示愤怒并威胁要开火，但我们的愤怒和威胁，不是要发动战争，而是要阻止战争，我们阻止了战争，我们做到了。

Since those summits, since those two summits, one in Singapore, one in Hanoi, the North Koreans haven’t tested a long range, ballistic missile, and they haven’t tested their nuclear weapons. Exactly zero tests have been conducted. That’s real foreign policy. It was humbling too, because it was the second trip, I had the chance to bring home American hostages from Pyongyang, three men at 3:00 in the morning.

自从那次峰会以来，自从那两次峰会后，一次在新加坡，一次在河内，北韩便再没敢测试过远程弹道导弹，也还没有测试过他们的核武器，确切地说，是零测试。这才是真正的外交政策。我也尽量让自己低调，因为这是我第二次去北朝鲜，在凌晨3点我将三个美国人质从平壤带了回来。

And America first always means never forgetting about our warriors. There was no greater honor to than the fact that we brought back other Americans like Pastor Brunson, who stayed in Turkey, detained wrongfully for just far too long. And we brought back so many remains of our fallen in Korea as well. This was amazing and right and America first.

“美国优先”意味着永远不要忘记我们的战士们，没有什么能比我们带回更多的其他美国人质更大荣耀的了。比如布伦森牧师他被错误地关押在土耳其太久，我们也带回了很多在朝鲜战争中牺牲将士们的遗体。这真是不可思议和正确的，是“美国优先”的价值体现。

So how many of you remember Qassem Soleimani, Allah rest his soul? This was the Iranian general who was trying to cause trouble for America. He was on a mission to harm Americans, but we were a few steps ahead of him. So in the end, he didn’t cause trouble for Americans or anyone else ever again.

你们有多少人记得卡西姆·索莱马尼？ 愿他的灵魂安息！这是一个试图给美国制造麻烦的伊朗将军。他当时正在执行一项伤害美国人的任务，但我们比他早了几步。结果是，他再也无法给美国人或任何人制造麻烦了。

Do you know that to this day, most of the liberals and most of the folks on still won’t acknowledge that riding the world of an America hating terrorists was a good thing? This is fantasy.

你们知道吗，直到今天，大多数的自由主义者和大多数人始终认识不到，消除一个攻击美国的恐怖分子是有必要和正义的事。这说明这些人还在睡梦中。

Look, we too, we drew a red line. When the Syrians gassed children and women, and we told them, don’t do that again. And when they crossed it, President Trump ordered 70 plus beautiful American made Tomahawk missiles to let them know that we weren’t going to allow them to kill women and children.

对此，我们也有自己的底线。当叙利亚人用毒气杀害儿童和妇女时，我们告诉他们，不要再这样做了。而当他们越过这条底线时，川普总统下令70枚美国制造的战斧导弹，让他们知道我们不会允许他们杀害妇女和儿童。

America first takes real courage. Takes a secretary of state willing to walk into a room and tell it like it is, and a president who have his back. We had that.

“美国优先”是需要真正勇气的，需要一个愿意走进房间实话实说的国务卿和一个在后面支持他的总统。我们都有过。

Speaking of backs, I hear President Biden saying America’s back. Back to what? So back to pallets of cash to the Ayatollah, so he can build missiles that threaten us. Back to apologizing when Iranians tell our soldiers and sailors to take to their knees at gunpoint. Back to President Biden killing pipeline. Back to all the things that put America at risk. Back to supporting a pipeline in Europe that’ll create European jobs.

说到回来，我听到拜登总统说美国回来了。回归什么了？是回到给阿亚图拉提供成捆现金的时代，回到他们能用导弹来威胁我们吗？回到伊朗人逼着我们的士兵和水手面对他们的枪口下跪，还要向他们道歉的时刻吗？回到拜登总统终止输油管道、回到那些所有将美国置于危险处境的事情吗？回到支持欧洲的输油管线以创造欧洲的就业机会吗？

This is not where we want to go back to any time at all. And we certainly don’t want to go back to letting China have trade deals that kill our jobs right here in America. We can’t afford it. We can’t afford it. It’s not the right thing. And we don’t have to do it. We must be bold. And we must always put America first.

这些是我们任何时候都不想要回去的内容，我们当然更不想回到让中国达成他们想要的贸易协议以此扼杀我们在美国的就业机会。我们承受不起，我们承担不起这种后果。这是错误的，我们没有必要这样做。我们必须勇敢，我们必须永远把美国放在第一位。

We spend a lot of time talking about being canceled. I was really happy that this was being aired on television, not canceled, at least for the moment. We worked tirelessly with great success to deliver on our values, American values that have made this such a special unique nation. Look, this country was built on what our founders understood and then the bill of rights that came behind that constitution.

我们花了很多时间来讨论被“取消”。我真的很高兴今天我们在电视上直播了，还没有被取消，至少目前是这样。我们孜孜不倦地工作，在传播我们的价值观方面取得了巨大的成就。正是美国的价值观使这个国家变得如此出类拔萃，这个国家是建立在我们建国者的理念之上的，在宪法之后又有《人权法案》。

They built a nation recognizing that our rights come from our creator and not from any government. Our union becomes more perfect every time we defend our sovereignty and we defend our borders, and I’m proud that we were the most pro-life administration in the history of the United States of America.

他们注入了这样的理念，那就是我们的权利是来自造物主，而不是来自任何国家的政府。我们的联邦变得日趋完美，特别在捍卫我们的主权和边界时，我为我们是美利坚合众国历史上最具人性的政府而感到自豪。

It was my job to deny that any taxpayer dollars from any hardworking American ever went to perform an abortion any place in the world. And we promoted adoption everywhere and always. And don’t forget too, President Trump appointed an awful lot of judges that understand the words life, and liberty and words that have real, real meaning.

我的工作就是要确保任何辛勤工作的美国纳税人的钱不会在世界其它地方被用于支持堕胎。我们一直在各地致力于推广领养。也别忘了,川普总统任命了很多法官，这些法官理解生命、自由，以及这些词汇的真正含义。

I worked with the Mexican government, my counterpart, foreign minister of Mexico and its president to secure our borders. We worked hard too, to make sure that drugs and other things didn’t traffic across that border, that meant too protecting your right to own firearms.

我与墨西哥政府，我的同行，墨西哥外交部长及其总统合作以确保我们的边境安全。我们也付出辛勤的努力以确保毒品和其它物品不会偷运入境，这也意味着要维护你们拥有枪支的权利。

Our Second Amendment matters. It builds communities. It builds strong families, and it makes sure each of us has the right to defend ourselves precisely as our founders intended.

我们的第二修正案很重要，它建立了我们的小区，建立了强大的家庭，并确保我们每个人都有权利按照我们的开国元勋所希望的那样来捍卫自己。

I’m always stunned. Liberals pretend to care about the poor. And then they side with the union bosses against the workers. They pretend to stand for children while kids in Democrat led inner cities aren’t in front of computers like they think they are. They’re struggling to figure out how to stay safe from drug Lords and how to get a meal.

我总是倍感震惊，看到自由派人士假装关心穷人，然后他们却站在工会领导一边去对付工人们。他们假装关心孩子们，在民主党掌管下的城市贫民窟的孩子们并没有像他们以为的那样在计算机前学习，他们正苦苦挣扎着如何能摆脱毒枭，以及如何获取食物。

That’s not good leadership. That’s not America first leadership. It’s not taking care of those people you’re charged with protecting, and we need to get every one of our children back in school. And we need to get them back in now.

那不是好领导。那不是“美国优先”的领导人。你没有照顾好这些你必须去照顾和保护的人们。我们需要让每一个孩子都回到学校，我们需要让他们现在就回到学校上课。

I was a soldier about 25, 30 years ago, and about 100 pounds ago too. And when I hear Democrats say they want a strong America, I know that they are working to undermine it. Sadly, mark my word. They’re going to cut the defense budget that we worked so hard to build. They’ll do it to pay for their Green New Deal.

我曾当过兵，那是25、30年前，也是我体重比现在少100磅的时候。我听到民主党人说他们想要一个强大的美国时，我知道他们正在削弱美国。很遗憾，记住我的话。他们要削减我们努力建立的国防预算，他们会用这笔钱来支付他们的绿色新政。

Kind of makes me mad, right? They’re going to trade army green for AOC green. That is a bad, bad trade. And as I said before, our young men and women, we don’t want to put them in harms way. We don’t want them to go to war, but when we’re weak at home, when we don’t stand up for our military, the risk of war increases when deterrence fades. We cannot let that happen.

这让我很生气，对吧？他们要用军队绿色来换取AOC绿色。这是一个糟糕的，糟糕的交易。就像我之前所说的，我们的年轻将士们，我们不要让他们处于危险之中。我们不想让他们去打仗，但当我们国家软弱无力的时候，当我们没有成为军队的坚强后盾时，当威慑力减弱的时候，战争的风险就会增加。我们不能让这种情况发生。

They want to defund the police while they barricade the Capitol. This is backwards. And canceling our freedom to assemble peacefully, while censoring our communications online is completely antithetical to what our founders understood about America.

他们想削减警察部门的预算，却又需要警员封锁国会大厦以保障他们的安全，这简直搞颠倒了。取消我们和平集会的自由，同时审查我们的网上通讯。这完全违背了我们的先驱们对美国的建国理念。

It reminds me when I headed off to West Point, my parents couldn’t afford to fly to New York. I grew up in Southern California. So they left me at the airport. My mother was happy and all kinds of feelings. My mother was a cigarette smoking high school graduate who was the most decent and toughest woman I’ve ever met.

这让我想起了我去西点军校的时候，我的父母没有钱飞去纽约。我在南加州长大，因此他们就在机场与我告别。我母亲很高兴，她百感交集。母亲是一个抽烟的高中毕业生，是我所见过的最体面和最坚强的女人。

She said, “Mike,” she pulled me aside. I think she didn’t want my dad to hear this. She said, “Michael, I know you’re a grinder. Don’t ever let them wear you down. Wear them down.” I’ve never forgotten what my mom told me that day. We’ll all remember it. Keep grinding, keep championing American values.

她把我拉到一边说：「迈克」我想她是不想让我爸听到这些。她说：「迈克，我知道你是个经得起磨练的人，永远不要让他们拖垮你，你去拖垮他们。」我永远不会忘记那天妈妈对我说的话。我们都要记得坚持磨练，坚持倡导美国价值观。

One more story. The smartest, best officer that I ever came to know, he worked closely with me as a former air force special operations officer. I’d ask him about someone who was working on our team and I’d say, “What do you think of him?” Or, “What do you think of her?” And he’d say, “Love that guy, Pipe Hitter”

还有一个故事，我认识一个最聪明最优秀的城市官员。他是一名前空军特种兵军官，曾与我密切合作。我向他打听我们团队的某位成员，我问他：「你觉得他怎么样？」 或「你怎么看她？」他会说：「我喜欢那家伙！管道修理工。」

You know what he meant? He meant that person got stuff done. They were a grinder. They kept banging away. You all know these four years are going to test us. I need each of you to be a Pipe Hitter. Get stuff done.

你知道他是什么意思吗？他是指那人会排除万难去完成任务。他们就像是一台坚忍的研磨机，他们不达目的绝不罢休。你们都知道那四年是对我们的考验，我需要你们每个人都成为那样的“管道修理工”，排除万难，完成任务。

Keep grinding, be a Pipe Hitter, be a Pipe Hitter. Be a pipe hitter at church, right? Be a Pipe Hitter at your PTA meeting. Don’t let them bring crazy into your classrooms. Be a Pipe Hitter at your VFW. Lead the team to continue to support our military warriors.

坚持磨练专研，做一个“管道修理工”。做教会里的“管道修理工”，好吧？做家长会上的“管道修理工”。不要让他们把疯狂带进你们的教室。做你们退伍军人协会的“管道修理工”，带领团队继续支持我们的军队将士们。

Be a Pipe Hitter. Be a Pipe Hitter when they tell you they’re closing the mine or the factory because of some green vision. Keep it open.

做一个“管道修理工”。当他们告诉你因为某些绿色能源的想法，他们要关闭矿场或停掉工厂时，你们必须坚持开工。

President Reagan, a real Pipe Hitter, President Reagan got stuff done. And he once said, “If we lose freedom here, if we lose freedom here, there is no place to escape. This is the last stand on earth.” I saw that. I saw that as your secretary of state, as I traveled all around the world. And I’m confident that he was right.

里根总统，一个真正的“管道修理工”，里根总统能把事情做成。他曾经说过：「 如果我们在这里失去了自由，如果在我们这里也失去了自由，我们便无处可逃。这是地球上最后的净土。」我看到了这一点。尤其当我作为你们的国务卿去到世界各地的时候，我坚信他是对的。

I am confident that the American star will shine across the heavens so long as we keep a proper understanding of our God-given rights at the center of who we are. And we keep up our quest to secure our freedom for our own people and for all of mankind. I’ll be with you in the fight. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

我坚信，美国之星将照耀天穹。只要我们能正确认识到，上帝赋予的天赋人权是我们的核心，只要我们坚持不懈为我们的人民和全人类争取自由，我会和你们一起战斗。上帝保佑你们！愿上帝保佑美利坚合众国！谢谢你们！
