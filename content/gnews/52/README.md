After the broadcast this morning, I’ve got many messages. Many questions are related to G-Clubs’ interactive program for the Spring Festival. Brothers and sisters in arms, after watching the broadcast [on that day], we will have an interactive program, for it is a must and I have to interact with you. I guess that we will have probably 5,000 to 8,000 members online and approximately 20,000 members offline. But this will be an interactive moment, which is only for us, not for the public. In that moment, you can directly ask me any questions.  Although it will be the Chinese New Year [celebration], let’s not waste time talking about niceties but just get into questions someone might have for me since there will be so many people there, all right? If anyone wants to speak, just ask the question directly. It would be better if the questions are useful.

这个今天上午直播完以后的有很多信息给我留，关于G-Clubs春节互动的节目，很多问我的问题。战友兄弟姐妹们，除了你们看完视频以后，咱们互动的节目那是必须的，那是法定的，七哥必须跟你们互动，大概吧，我们是线上大概5000到8000，线下大概2万左右，我估计啊，但是这是封闭的，是不公开的，不公开的，就是谁想问七哥啥问题，你就直接，虽然是大过年的，咱也别说那么多，太热炕头的话，就是别耽误时间，因为那么多人，是吧？谁要是想说话，就直接问问题，最好有用。

As we just finished our G-Fashion meeting, the lawyer yelled in disagreement. Thanks to Ms. Yanping Wang who argued firmly on just grounds.  She told the lawyer that it is what it is whether they agree or disagree. It is going to be a lottery drawing with the prize of 5 BMWs, or maybe 5 Mercedes-Benz, five cars for sure. Probably it will be 5 BMWs for now.  Then, perhaps the bags that I mentioned in the morning, for example, the shoulder bag and the waist bag.  However, there won’t be enough time to make them since it probably takes 40 days to make.  In such case, we can change to the Guo Warrior Suit instead, the black color that I wore before.  The Warrior Suit of G-Forever and G-Fashion, 500 hats, bracelets, and rings, all are lottery prizes free for the winning members.  Isn’t that something! Many brothers-in-arms sent me messages, saying, “Brother Seven [Miles], we will give them to you if we win the prizes.” Well, please don’t do this!  You will get me in trouble if your lottery drawings end up in my pocket.  Who is that? Only a thief, a liar, or the “Nine-Finger Queen” can do things like that.  Correct? It is not right to do that.

刚刚我们的 G-Fashion 开完会，律师刚才嗷嗷的叫，不同意。这得感谢王艳平同志，这王艳平据理力争，说你同意也得同意，不同意也得同意，就是这样了，抽奖，五台宝马，也可能五台奔驰，反正肯定五台车。大概目前定的是五台宝马，然后比如说我上午说的那个包，那个背包还有个腰包，但是那个时间实在来不及，可能是要40天才能做出来，那就改成郭战装，就一整套我穿的那个郭战装，就黑的那个，G-Forever，G-Fashion的战装，这都是送给大家的，抽奖抽给大家的，500个帽子，还有手环、戒指，这了不得了。还有个就战友很多说，我抽到以后七哥我送给你，很多人给我发这个信息，你千万别这么发，你送给我，我就出事了，哪有抽奖抽到七哥腰包里去了？那成啥人了？那不成欺民贼、九指王了吗？对不对？不可能。

In addition, you cannot donate your winning prize to the Rule of Law Foundation.  There will be two choices for you. With respect to the car lottery, for example, the BMW car is worth 100,000 dollars, which is at the 100,000 dollars level, so you can ask for cash, which can be given to you directly.  For example, as to the prize of 40,000 dollars, maybe 50,000 to 60,000 dollars, or the prize of 20,000 plus or 30,000 dollars, you can ask for cash, which can be wired to you directly. You can also ask for a bank card.  Either way will work. The price is based on the U.S. market. They will tell you what make and model the car is and how much it’s worth, you know? After they tell you those, you may say I want the car, then all of the tariffs when sending the car out to different countries from the U.S., for example, to Mainland China, Japan, Thailand, Africa… all the expenses are yours to bear after the car leaves the U.S.  Of course, you have to pay the tax. If you say, “I don’t want the car. I want the money,” then they will give you the cash immediately.

所有的东西，你也不能捐法制基金，你有两个选择，就这个车抽奖，你比如说那个宝马车是10 万美元，10万美元的级别的，你可以要钱，你可以要现金的，直接给你的。比如说四万那个，可能是5万多6万美元，还有2万多、3万美元的那个，你可以要钱，直接把钱汇给你，你也可以要卡，都可以。这个价钱定义是美国的市场，他会给你写出来什么车，什么系列，什么价格，是吧？然后告诉你，然后你说我要车，从美国发出去所有的关税，不同的国家，你比如说发给大陆，你发给日本，发给泰国，非洲 … 所有离开美国之后，店里的费用全是你的，税当然是你的，你说我不要车，我要钱，“叭”就把现金给你了。

If you say that you want to use the car in the U.S., you can just pick up the car and leave.  That’s how simple it is.  You can go to the nearby city to pick up the car.  The rest of the prizes, like rings, bracelets, Warrior Suits, and hats can be sent to your home without extra charge.  So, I won’t be able to reply to every one of you.  Brothers-in-arms, dose this sound okay to you?

然后你说你在美国用上了，你就直接提车走就行了，就这么简单，你到你的附近的城市提车就行了，剩余那些什么戒指啊，手链啊战装啊，是吧？帽子啊那都是到你家的，那不用再加钱了。所以说我就没办法一一回了，兄弟姐妹们，中不中？
