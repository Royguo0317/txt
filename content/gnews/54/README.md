新闻简述：郭先生在2021年2月28的盖特视频中，就一个中共国教师在课堂上贬损穷人子弟的视频发表评论，痛斥共产党的强盗逻辑，他们说“江山是人民的”，但是老百姓过得猪狗不如。他还说，美国在刚刚的CPAC大会上，与会者达成100%共识必须除掉共产党。

**共产党说江山是人民的！？**

**Does the Country Belong to the People as What the CCP Claims?**

尊敬的战友们好！今天是2月28号。我怎么一上盖特就想笑呐，嬉皮笑脸，严肃点。兄弟姐妹们，本来我今天上午想直播呐。昨天是晚上快到8点了，我实际上才是正儿八经的睡觉，太多的和国内战友的联系。我相信兄弟姐妹们知道的比我多，国内的政治、经济，还有国内现在很多老百姓过得实在是不太好，当然了，中南坑肯定比老百姓过得好。

Hello, dear honorable fellow fighters! Today is February 28. Why do I want to laugh whenever I get onto Getter? Always happy and giggling. I need to be a little more serious. Brothers and sisters, I planed to broadcast this morning. I didn’t actually go to bed until 8 pm yesterday. Too many communications with fellow fighters in mainland China. I believe that brothers and sisters know much more than I do about the domestic politics and economy, and the fact that many ordinary Chinese are not doing well right now. Of course, people in the Zhongnan Pit are definitely living a better life than ordinary people.

所以在国内大肆地流行着，是吧？穷人不要学法律，穷人一旦学了法律以后，会走偏激的路线。偏激谁呐？偏激谁呐？穷人不能学哲学，是吧？学哲学是侮辱了哲学，你就是猪狗，你怎么有脑子呢？是吧？你学哲学侮辱了哲学。穷人不要搞投资，不要搞大投资，为啥？你又没啥本钱你搞什么投资？那都是富人家、共产党家人玩的游戏，对吧？

So, it is very popular in mainland China right now to say that the poor shouldn’t go to a law school. Once they have learned laws, they will likely become extremists, but to against whom? And the poor cannot study philosophy, right? If the poor learned philosophy, it would be an insult to philosophy because the poor are pigs and dogs and do not have brains, right? You’re an insult to philosophy if you study philosophy. The poor shouldn’t make any investment, no big investment. Why? The poor don’t have the original capital to make an investment. Investment is the game for rich people and the families of the CCP, right?

然后富人不要老想着上什么大学，富人搞个初中毕业就不错了，是吧？就像文贵那样，你干什么？上什么大学？你知道那么多了，对党不是危害嘛，对吧？富人更不要想出国，你出国干嘛去？跟人家当奴隶去，你就是我家的奴隶，你干嘛出去？是吧？富人更是不要搞什么科技，你哪有脑子高科技啊？你是被科技的人，你怎么高科技啊？对不对？

And then rich people don’t need to think about going to college all the time because a middle school education is good enough for them, right? Just like me. Why do you go to college? If you are too knowledgeable, you will be a threat to the CCP, right? The rich shouldn’t even think about going abroad. Why do you go abroad? To become others’ slaves? You are my slaves. Why do you go outside, right? The rich shouldn’t engage in technology because you are not smart enough. You should be the one controlled by technology, so how can you be involved in high-tech? Right?

还有那老师，大家也看到了我昨天盖特上的视频，说那领导的孩子和你的穷人家草根儿的孩子，那怎么一样的智商呢？那领导的孩子有钱人的爹妈，一天挣的钱是你妈一辈子的钱，挣50万，是不是？50年挣的钱。言外之意，你们这帮王八犊子，智商不够，情商不够，当官的孩子都是高智商、高情商，有钱的人高智商、高情商。我R你八辈祖宗，我真的生气，你知道吗？

Also, everyone has watched my Getter video yesterday. The teacher talked about the difference in IQ between leaders’ kids and poor people’s kids. Children of the leaders have rich parents, who make 500K per day, which is your mom’s lifetime income or the amount of money that your mom earns in 50 years, right? In other words, you bastards (children of the poor) don’t have enough IQ or EQ; rather, children of the leaders have high IQ and EQ, and the rich have high IQ and EQ too. I screw your eight generations of ancestors. I was really angry to hear that, you know?

我从小第一次跟老师打架，就因为这个，我哪天好好说说这一段。当时我打了一个镇长的孩子，后来把这个老师的孩子也打了，因为他俩欺负我。打完以后当着全校的学生面，拿着这个怼我的胸，我都不吱声。最后他说：“就凭你..你爹是干啥的？你敢打镇长的孩子，你敢打老师的孩子，班主任的孩子？” 我恼火了，我拎起板砖给一顿臭砸，对不对呀？我打的就是你们这帮人的孩子。

When I was a child, the first time I fought against a teacher was exactly for this. I will talk about it in detail someday. At that time I hit the mayor’s kid, and afterwards, I also hit the teacher’s kid because they bullied me. After the fight, the teacher insulted me in front of all the students in the school, but I said nothing then. In the end, he said, “Look at you. What does your father do for a living? How dare you hit the child of the mayor and the child of your home room teacher?” I was so annoyed and picked up a brick and beat him up. Right? The children of these people were exactly who I wanted to beat.

我很生气，知道吗？我非常生气。到今天中国不但几十年后没见好，今天公然在教室里，在政法大学，在北大，在清华，这些王八蛋的所谓大学里，公然侮辱中国人14亿老百姓。

I was angry, you know? I was very angry. China hasn’t got any better decades later till today. Today, they openly insult the 1.4 billion ordinary Chinese people in the classrooms, in f\*cking schools like the University of Political Science and Law, Peking University, and Tsinghua University.

竟然在这短短的两周前，你伟大的中南坑的领导习近平说什么？“江湖是人民的，江山是人民的”，既然江湖和江山都是人民的，邓小平也说你们是人民的儿子，怎么草根人现在就这么不值钱啊？我们只能当猪狗是吗？我们只能当猪狗，连反驳、连问的权力，连改变的权利都不能有，连想改变权力都不能有。你们这帮孙子！

What did the “great leader” of the Zhongnan Pit, Xi Jinping, say two weeks ago? “All the rivers and lakes belong to the people, and all the rivers and mountains [meaning the country] belong to the people”. If everything belongs to the people, as Deng Xiaoping said, “you (the CCP) are sons of the people”, then why are the grassroots still so poor now? We can only be pigs and dogs, right? We can only be pigs and dogs, who have no rights to argue, to question, to change, not even the right to dream about changing the power. You bastards!

共产党，你要不被郭文贵灭了，这个天下不灭了你共产党，全人类都不应该活着。你不仅是种族大清洗、反人类罪，你奴役了几十亿的中国人民在过去的几十年，你犯下的滔天罪行，怎么给你算都不为过。 咱们走着看。

The CCP, if you are not taken down by me, Miles Guo, or by the world, then the whole mankind will not survive. You’ve not only committed genocide and the crimes against humanity, but also enslaved billions of Chinese people over the past decades. The heinous crime that you have committed can never be overstated. Let’s wait and see.

我相信共产党你们自己都知道发生了什么，美国就在过去短短的不到70个小时内，所有的保守派大会里面，几乎100%一致地，必须干灭共产党。所有共和党和美国保守派和美国的国家价值观、民主价值观、文化、教育、宗教，被你共产党蓝金黄蚕食透了。你们也知道白宫、国务院、五角大楼，现在没有形成统一。就是非常清楚的，在灭共的问题的上不统一，什么事也不能统一。

I believe you, the CCP, know what is happening. In the past 70 hours, among those who went to the CPAC, almost 100% of them agreed that the CCP must be taken down. All republicans, the conservatives of the U.S., the national values, and the democratic values, cultures, educations, as well as religions have all been thoroughly corrupted by the CCP’s BGY plot. You (the CCP) knows that the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon haven’t reached an agreement yet. It is very clear that if there is no unity on the issue of taking down the CCP, then they can be united on nothing.

沼泽地这块儿是你们能勾兑的事情，我可以告诉你们，郭文贵都能做到。咱不信走着看。过去的四年证明给你们看了，我们还会证明给你们看。就凭你们现在，你们需要这些穷人的时候，你让他站着说是江山是人民的，然后你再代表人民。爹亲娘亲不如党亲，最后是亲的当了几十年、几代人的奴才、当猪狗。现在还要把我们的孩子当了猪狗都不如的对待。你们这帮王八蛋，简直是残忍至极，天必灭你共。

Let me tell you, for whatever you can get from the swamp by collusion, I, Miles Guo can get it as well. If you don’t believe me, then wait and see. I have used the past four years to prove it to you already. We will prove more to you. Look at what you are doing. When you need the poor, you allow them to stand and say “the country belongs to the people”. Then, you also say you represent the people. You said, “Father and Mother are not as dear as the Party”, but you’ve treated your “dearest” ones as slaves and as pigs and dogs for decades and generations. Now, you want to treat our children even worse than pigs and dogs. You bastards are the cruelest bunch, so God will destroy you!

兄弟姐妹们，另外一个，很多战友给我发信息，国内的，哎呀说到我直生气。这又自摸了，不行，又是狼来了。找钥匙，钥匙澜，钥匙澜，找不着钥匙到处跑。

Another thing, brothers and sisters, many fellow fighters sent me messages that domestic…well, I am so angry whenever I say this… touching my own body again… the wolf is coming again…looking for the keys… “key Lan” (referred to Yang Lan) can’t find her keys and is running around.

哎呀，我看着国内现在天天是：穷人不配思考，穷人不配上学，穷人不能发展，穷人不能任何有像人一样的有尊严的活着。生气！“所有中国的问题都是灾难的问题”，灾难的问题都是共产党搞的，所有灾难的问题都是共产党是根本原因。没有任何其它原因，都是扯的。当然了，我们草根儿们太懦弱了，没勇气、自私，也是个重要的原因。

I am so angry to hear such things everyday from mainland China: the poor don’t have the right to think, to go to school, to develop themselves, or to live with dignity like human beings. “All problems in China were caused by natural disasters”, but all the disasters were created by the CCP. The CCP is the fundamental reason for all the disasters. No other reasons. All other reasons are just bullshits. Of course, another important reason is our grassroots’ cowardice, lack of courage, and selfishness.

另外一个战友们很多人发信息，关于G-Coin、G-Dollar。我今天早上我回复了很多信息。我再给战友们说：它必须按比例来，真的不可能你要多少是多少。这里唯一的有2000万个G-Coin，这个是七哥找基金买下来，买下来以后放到喜马拉雅联盟委员会，专门给未来在国内被陷害的、喝咖啡、喝茶、失去自由、被迫害、被剥夺资产的，还有一些捐款法治基金、法治社会，被剥夺利益的，被威胁的，是给这些人的补助。

In addition, many fellow fighters sent me messages about G-Coin and G-Dollar. I replied many of them this morning. Let me say it again to my fellow fighters: it must come in proportion. It is not like that you can buy as many as you want. There is only one exception though, that is the 20-million G-Coins to be bought by a fund recommended by me and stored in Himalaya Alliance Committee, serving as a subsidy in the future to those who have been framed, inquired by the police, lost freedom, persecuted, or deprived their assets in mainland China. That should also include those who were deprived of benefits and threatened because of the donations they made to the Rule of Law Foundation and the Rule of Law Society.

然后这次没有任何给予，完全按过去投资G系列的比例来，按比例来，现在是1比1，你投了1块钱，就有1块钱的一个，对应一个，1块钱的投资有一个G-Coin。就是这个现在咱不够，要按照完全1比1的话，那几个大额投资者，他就8亿多了，那战友一个也没了，那就需要大概16亿，16亿。不可能16亿的嘛，战友们。所以说大额的，我已经告诉战友们，你们不用拿了，就给这些小额的战友们。大家永远不要忘了，我们所有的爆料革命的这一切，是让穷人，让草根儿的兄弟摆脱贫困，不是给大咖准备的，所以大咖们投的钱多，对不起，还没名额。这就是爆料革命，这就是新中国联邦，咱和共产党完全不一样。

There is no giveaway this time. The distribution [of G-Coins] will be completely in proportion to your previous investments in G-Series. The proportion is 1:1 for the time being, meaning that for each dollar you have invested, you can buy one G-Coin. That said, we still don’t have enough G-Coins for everyone. If the 1:1 rule is followed closely, those big investors will already have more than 800 million coins, leaving our fellow fighters with nothing. Then we would have to distribute 1.6 billion coins in total, which is impossible. Therefore, I have told the fellow fighters who are big investors to leave the chance to those small investors. Please don’t forget that all the Whistleblower Movement has been doing is to lift the poor, grass-root fellow fighters out of poverty. The opportunity is not for the rich big shots. Therefore, even though the big shots have invested big, I have to say sorry to them and don’t give them the quota. This is what the Whistleblower Movement is about, and this is what the New Federal State of China is about. We are different from the CCP.

我有时间，因为我现在，我今天不敢直播，因为我有点搂不住，我老担心我搂不住，所以我不要直播，我控制我自己。我今天晚上如果我有时间，我把我的心情弄的不好点的时候，我再直播，就是我心情太好了，我就兴奋，得意有点忘形，我可以把我的心情特不好的时候，我再直播。今天晚上可能直播，我要试一天的时间，我到处找毛病，到处找不痛快，我把我自己弄得心情非常不好，晚上我就给你们直播。我聊聊，为什么一定要咱们这些穷兄弟发财？为什么要这些穷兄弟发财？

I do have time for live broadcasting today, but I don’t dare to do it now because I am afraid that I will not be able to hold myself. I always worry that I couldn’t hold myself enough. So, I am not going to broadcast [today] because I want to hold myself back. If time allows and I am able to make myself less excited by this evening, I will then broadcast. When my mood is high, I tend to get too excited and out of control. I will broadcast when I feel really bad. So it’s possible to have a live broadcast this evening, but I will have to look for frustrations everywhere and get myself into a really low mood during the day. I will then talk about why we must help our poor brothers-in-arms get rich.

还有个更重要的事情，我昨天给联盟委员会的兄弟姐妹们开会，我从来不说的，我昨天第一次跟他们说。我今天可以告诉你们：不管是G-Coin、G-Dollar，不管是G-TV、G-News，还是G-Clubs、G-Fashion，大家一定要记住，现在是很多机构投资者百分百控制的，七哥真的一股都没有，但是我们有一个发展协议，未来我们有认股权等等等的一些安排，最终这些细节必须有战友51%的控制权，51%控股权的战友，就是现在的这1300把椅子，和所有参与G-Clubs、G-Coin 所有战友的，这是必然的结果，这是所有战友们永远要监督完成。我们需要很长的路要走，因为前期要机构投资，前期战友投资、机构投资、大机构投资，最后上市和进行市场化。但是不要忘了，这是我们核心的目标。

Another important thing is that I held a meeting with our brothers and sisters in the Himalaya Alliance Committee yesterday. I had never said this before, so yesterday was the first time I talked about it. But I can tell you all today: please remember, G-Coin, G-Dollar, G-TV, G-News, G-Clubs, and G-Fashion are all 100% controlled by institutional investors right now, and I personally do not own any stock. Yet, we have a developmental agreement and some arrangements so that in the future we will have stock option, and ultimately, our fellow fighters must control 51% of the stock. That is our 1300 “chairs” (private investors) and all the fellow fighters who have engaged in G-Clubs and G-Coin. It is a bound result. This is something that fellow fighters need to oversee to make sure that it gets done. There is a long way to go because we need the institutional investment and our fellow fighters’ investment at the early stage and then get listed and go public in the end. Please don’t forget that this is the core of our goal.

今天晚上6点钟以后有时间我就给大家乱聊一下，当然得我心情不好的情况下，心情好我就不直播了，心情不好了我再直播。6点钟以后见吧，中不中兄弟姐妹们？我最近老自摸儿啊，啥毛病嘛这是啊？

I will do a broadcast to chat with everyone tonight after 6 pm if time allows. Of course, it is under the situation when I am in a bad mood. If I am in a good mood, I will not broadcast until my mood gets bad. See you after 6 pm, alright, brothers and sisters? Why do I always touch my own body recently? What is wrong with me?
