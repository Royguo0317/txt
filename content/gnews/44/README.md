**简述：在2021年4月9日的盖特视频中，郭先生感叹中共国没有真正的企业家，只有混家，而美国的一个 Elon Musk 干的事是多少个国家都做不到的。中共国对现代文明没有贡献，却天天吹嘘自己的富豪排名和假装战狼，糊弄自己，非常可悲。**

**中共国没有真正的企业家****  ****只会搞战狼糊弄自己**

**There Are No Real Entrepreneurs in Communist China**

我今天早上直播的时候没有说到，你看这个企业家，我今天看到一个关于 Elon Musk 的特斯拉的某个项目的计划啊什么的，基金里面的这个研究人员[的报告]。你看一个特斯拉干了多少事？是多少个国家做不到的事，一个企业家做到了？这就是美国的伟大。

I didn’t talk about it during the live broadcast this morning. Let’s talk about entrepreneurs. I read a project planning report related to Elon Musk’s Tesla today. It’s a report made by researchers of the foundation. You can see that too many things have been accomplished by only one Tesla. These things can’t even be done by many countries, but one entrepreneur did it! This is the greatness of America.

还有，你再看iPhone，iPhone下一步的整个换代产品已经不是这么简单了，换代产品还有整个的它未来要和量子电脑和超级电脑的结合，和天空 Wi-Fi 的结合，这了不得了。

Also, think about the iPhone. The next generation of iPhone will not be so simple anymore. It will be combined with quantum computers and supercomputers and with Sky Wi-Fi in the future, which is amazing.

看看 Elon Musk [研制]的无人机、无人汽车、大货车、火箭、天空 Wi-Fi，整个卫星发射系统基地，和未来的无人驾驶的汽车整个系统。这个人简直是真的是超人呐，真的是钢铁侠的在世啊，钢铁侠也没他整的那么明白。而且人家该干啥干啥，这样的人在中国能活的了吗？早活不了了。

Take a look at Elon Musk’s drones, unmanned vehicles and trucks, rockets, sky Wi-Fi, the entire satellite launch system and base, and the whole system of unmanned vehicles in the future. This person is really a Superman, really is a living Iron Man. Even Iron Man couldn’t be as great as he is. Moreover, he can still live a normal life and do whatever he wants. Do you think such people can survive in China? He would have died long ago.

这就是整个中国人不明白的事，为什么中国人不问问，中国[为什么]从来没有一个 Elon Musk？[为什么]没有[自主研发生产]一个iPhone手机？甚至连个三星集团都没有。为什么整个14亿的中国人连马桶盖都搞不出来？[中国人]问问自己的国家，扪心自问，你所有开的车，现在文明的东西，哪一样是中国人研发出来的？

This is something that the Chinese don’t understand. Why don’t the Chinese ask why there has been no Elon Musk in China? Why hasn’t there been anything like iPhone [invented in China]? Not even a Samsung Group. Why can’t China make even a toilet seat with a population of 1.4 billion? Go ask your country and ask yourself what things, either the cars that you drive or anything in the civilized world, were invented by Chinese?

中国没有企业家，只有混家。混子的混家，只有大混家、中混家、小混家、小痞子混家。[中共国]没有企业家，这是一个民族的悲哀。美国随便一个企业几万亿美元市值，那是真的，不是炒出来的。不会像中共似的。房子[是]用来住的，不是炒的。是吧？疫苗是用来打的不是用来炒的。中国啥都要炒，炒到啥都没有。一代又一代人炒，把命炒没了，炒了好几代没炒出任何东西来，锅都炒干了。

There are no real entrepreneurs in China, only rascals. There are only big rascals, middle rascals, small rascals, and little ruffians. China has no entrepreneurs, which is sad for a nation. The market value of any company in the U.S. could be several trillion dollars, and that number is real, not something by stock speculation. It’s not like the CCP – everything is like stock speculation. For example, the house is supposed for living, not for speculation, right? The vaccine is for fighting the virus, not for speculation. Everything is like this in China, so it has nothing real. They do this generation after generation until they lose their lives in it, until they find nothing is left for them.

然后现在搞战狼[外交]，糊弄自己。就是这个世界上很可怕的，就是没有一个国家民族再喜欢所谓的壮肾药的，壮肾药的。伟哥最大的销售市场是中国，但是伟哥不是中国发明的，这不是悲剧吗？但却要在全世界炒[作]，我们有全世界最牛的排名富豪。[CCP]有豪，[但]你有富吗？这就是说未来世界上最最重要的战友是什么？[答案是]金融产品、科技。金融和科技，你真正的[核心]是你有原创的和原始的知识产权，你才能得到世界的尊重，你才有真正的实力，否则你不是骗自己吗？糊弄啥呢？

Then now you [the CCP] pretend you are a war wolf to fool yourself. This is a very scary thing. There has been no any other country or nation in this world whose people like the so-called “kidney-strengthening” medicine [like China]. The biggest sales market for Viagra is China, but Viagra was not even invented in China. Isn’t this a tragedy? But it tells the whole world: “We have the world’s best ranked rich people.” You have upstarts, but do you have real rich people? My fellow fighters, what is the most important in the world in the future? The answer is financial products and technology. The key is that you need to have original intellectual properties. Only then can you be respected by the world, and only then can you have real strength. Otherwise, wouldn’t it be like you are lying to yourself? Who are you trying to fool?

你连个耐克鞋都做不明白。中国李宁鞋，你看看李宁鞋有几个[原创]？还卖四五万一双。有几个是你原创的？能代表中国人文化的？那鞋在中国那地方穿的真的就合适吗？中国人运动的时候穿运动鞋没事，平常穿运动鞋你觉得好看吗？真不如过去所谓的中国穿的那个球鞋。还有中国那叫什么“红蜻蜓”[皮鞋]，我觉得挺好的。虽然李宁的很多家人也支持爆料革命，[但是]咱[们]实话实说，是吧，这是个基本的常识。

You can’t even make shoes like Nike’s. Look at China’s Li-Ning shoes, how many techniques used in the shoes are their original work? They charge forty to fifty thousand a pair, but how many techniques have originated from them? How can they represent the Chinese culture? Are those shoes really suitable for Chinese? It’s okay for Chinese people to wear sneakers when they exercise, but do you think they look good on you as a casual wear? They are not even as good as the so-called tennis shoes worn by Chinese in the past. I think China’s Red Dragonfly shoes are pretty good though. Although many of Li-Ning’s family members also support our Whistleblower Movement, but we need to be honest on this, right? This is a basic common sense.

中国人有信仰吗？你看看美国的企业家里面有多少人是有虔诚的信仰？现在你看G系列里面几乎99%都是外国人。没有那么多事儿，大家就[是专注]干事[工作]。我昨天跟咱们一个秘密团队[开会]，研发的这个盖特他们做演讲。[秘密团队]都是我们中国人。哎呀，真好，这些孩子们。这些孩子他们演讲的时候那种认真执着[的样子]，我觉得真的中国人太伟大了。我为[爆料革命有]这样的战友，跟这样的人在一起工作我觉得特别幸福。他们那么真诚，那么善良，那么包容。

Do the Chinese have faith? See how many American entrepreneurs have devout beliefs? Now you can see that almost 99% of the people working for the G series are foreigners, so there are not many distracting things, and everyone is jsut focusing on the work. Yesterday, I had a meeting with a secret team of Getter developers, and they gave a talk. They are all Chinese, a bunch of awesome kids. Watching how serious and devoted these kids were when giving the talk, I deeply felt that Chinese people are really great. And I feel so lucky to have such great fellow fighters to work with. They are so sincere, so kind, and so tolerant.

这就是我们新中国联邦能把中国人最美好的一面，能给发扬出来，而且能变成一个人的尊严，能变成健康的财富，最终会演变成像美国的 Elon Musk 这样的企业家，诞生无数个。那才是我们新中国联邦最庆幸的[事情]。未来走在DC大街上，纽约大街抗议的人。他们未来会发现这些人当中会出来多少个伟大的企业家，而不是[CCP那样的]炒家，混家。

This is how the New Federal State of China (NFSC) brings out the nicest side of Chinese, and then turns it to the dignity and healthy wealth of these people. Eventually, they will grow into entrepreneurs like Elon Musk in the U.S., numerous of them. That will be the most fortunate thing for our NFSC. In the future, among the people who protested on D.C. and New York’s streets, many will become great entrepreneurs rather than rascals [like the CCP].

这是我们新中国联邦最重要的！

This is the most important thing to our NFSC!
