## 前国际货币基金组织卡恩是中共代言人&nbsp; 中共对美货币战迫在眉睫
` Himalaya Rose Garden Team` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/1061675/)

**郭先生在2021年4月6日的盖特视频中进一步曝光前世界货币组织主席卡恩（Dominique Strauss-Kahn）被中共收买，并且世界各大货币金融组织都已经被中共渗透。中共也正致力于抽走美国黄金、抛售美债等打击美国经济的一系列计划。然而美国的钟摆效应导致情报人员和政策不能够连贯，全国上下还在搞房地产经纪，两党还在争选票。此时的美国像一个诺大的冰山，在中共的煽风点火下已经沉没在即、迫在眉睫！**

**Former President of IMF Kahn Is Owned by the CCP**

兄弟姐妹们大家好啊，4月6号。昨天，大家知道，直播之后影响非常非常大。跟我联系的(人)，非常明显，昨天这个直播完以后跟我联系的，绝大多数都是世界政治、经济(的)战略家，都是世界级的人物。（他们）就来了，来了来了来了，是吧？然后咱们战友们反应就不太了解啊欧洲啊，WTO组织，IMF(国际货币基金组织)，世界银行，这(些)是世界上合法的世界(级)机构。基本上现在大家还都以为这三个机构欧洲、美国的，是吧？控制着。不同的情况下，事实上都被老共不同程度的渗透，（但CCP)想弄也弄不下来。

Hello, brothers and sisters. Today is April 6th. You know, the response to yesterday’s live broadcast was huge! The people who contacted me after I came out of the broadcast were largely international political and economic strategists, and they were all world-class figures. They just reached out to me, alright? However, our fellow fighters’ responses reflected that they did not know much about Europe, the WTO, the IMF (International Monetary Fund), and the World Bank – those legal institutions in the world. Basically, everyone now still thinks that these three institutions are under the control of Europe and the United States, right? Actually, they have been more or less infiltrated by the CCP, but the CCP hasn’t succeeded even though they wanted to.

另外一个就我说的那个卡恩 [注：国际货币基金组织前总裁]，卡恩这个小子上台以后百分之一百是共产党控制的。从他离开以后，他(去了)哪儿呢？就是在中法基金会当主席。马云和共产党一年给他1200万美元。你去想想去吧，(他)在美国弄成“犯罪”以后回到法国，又选总统。他要是选上总统，法国就是中共说的算了，想干啥干啥啊，那就是法国成了中共的小三了，百分之百的嘛！你看他现在还是。大家还记得这个人吧？跟那个什么斌啊，华斌，法国的华斌，那个特务，中法基金会主席。

The other thing is about Kahn (note: Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Former President of IMF). This guy, after coming to power, has been 100% controlled by the CCP. Since he stepped down, where has he gone? He became the Chairman of the France China Foundation. Jack Ma and the CCP give him 12 million U.S. dollars a year. Go think about it, he could return to France campaigning for presidency after committing a crime in the U.S. If he were elected, France would be owned by the CCP, and the CCP would be able to do whatever it wanted to and France would become the CCP’s mistress, 100%! Look at him, he is still like that [colluding with the CCP] now. You may still remember this person because of the guy named Hua Bin in France, a CCP agent, the Chairman of the France China Foundation.

所以整个当时IMF这个机构里边，也有咱战友。他清晰的记得当年卡恩这个家伙搞亚币啊，基础银行啊亚投行啊 [指：亚洲基础设施投资银行]，都(是)他折腾出来的。后来这就是为啥美国人当时警告他（的原因），你再敢说亚币整死你孙子，这就闭嘴不敢说了。这里面很多故事，哪天我要讲的时候，要是聊起来那大家会很惊讶，因为很多人很多事都是我亲身经历的。

So we have a fellow fighter in the IMF this whole time. He clearly remembered that Kahn was engaged in Asian currency and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which were all this guy’s work. For this, later he was warned by Americans that “if you dare to say anything about Asian currency, you bastard will get killed”. And then this guy shut up and dared not say it anymore. There are a lot of stories behind this. When I am ready to tell you someday, everyone will be surprised by these things. Many people and things are based on personal experiences.

这就是看出来咱战友们对世界形势的把握和认识。你看昨天路的访谈，博士军团整不明白这事，他没亲身经历，是吧？没有亲身经历就整不明白，只能是从表面上看，这背后的故事是看不到的。这就是一个局限性，这种事情你不亲身经历你是说不清楚，道不明白的。这整个的，中共谁去跟他(卡恩)联络，怎么回事？(发生了什么事)在法国？当年在欧洲怎么弄的？这里面有很多很多事情和人。

From this we can see how much our fellow fighters understand the world situation. If you have watched yesterday’s Lude Show, you will find that our PhD Team didn’t know much about this [IMF and Kahn]. That’s because they haven’t personally experienced it, have they? So they can only interpret it superficially because they didn’t know the stories behind the scene. This is their limitation. So if you don’t personally experience this kind of thing, you can’t interpret it clearly. This whole thing includes who was sent by the CCP to contact him (Kahn) and what was done, what happened in France, and what did they do in Europe. There are many many things and people involved.

你要没有这个亲身经历，你没有一个国家级的权力的这个参与，很难窥视到这种核心的秘密。就连美国这个国家所谓的情报部门，因为它政府每四年、每八年换一次，一换完人就走了，很多人也没有连续下来，这是美国很可怕的地方。好是好在一个民主的政府，坏是坏在四年左四年右，八年左八年右，你没办法。政府也换，国家策略也换。这是美国的很不好的地方，很难打交道，很难延续政策性，很难让这个国家能完整的记忆下来曾经历史上给它带来的危机和伤害。

If you don’t have this personal experience, or you haven’t been involved in this with a state-level power, it will be difficult for you to get a glimpse of this kind of core secret. Even people in the so-called national intelligence agencies in the U.S. don’t have continuous exposure [to this kind of secret] because its government is replaced every four or eight years, and people leave as soon as an administration is over. This is a terrible thing about the U.S. The good side is that it is a democratic government, and the downside is that its government shifts between left and right every four or eight years and you have no choice. The government constantly changes, and so are the national strategies. This is a very bad part of the U.S., because it makes it difficult for people to deal with them, there is hardly any continuity in its policies, and it is difficult for this country to fully remember the crises and harms ever brought to it in history.

就像这样的事情很多美国人就是一弄就过去了。 但是共产党可不过去啊，弄了七十年了。所以说这是完全不同的概念。这就是昨天华盛顿的很多人跟我说，“哇！都是最高级的人，问的问题跟孩子一样，跟孩子一样。”我说你走着看吧啊，这回(共产党)抽掉(美国的)黄金，抽走黄金，这都在计划范围之内。它抽黄金，这边儿准备好抛售（美国）的国债。

Things just like what I mentioned can be easily let go by many Americans. But the CCP won’t let it go, it has been working on those things for 70 years. So this is a completely different concept. This is why many people in Washington D. C. told me yesterday, “Wow! Those people are all top-rank officials, but the questions they asked are like questions from a child.” I said let’s wait and see. This time the CCP is withdrawing gold from the U.S., which is totally within the scope of the CCP’s plan. While they are withdrawing gold, they are getting ready to sell U.S. Treasury Securities.

美国现在使劲推房地产市场，房地产你知道，美国上次的金融危机，就是房地产市场(引发的)，是不是？就是房地美，这些房地产完全是胡扯的，是诈骗。最后搞（成了）个世界级的金融灾难。美国是在那个时候美元大幅贬值，大家你拿的还是美元，但是经过2008年的金融危机，美元已经大幅贬值，甚至信用超级受损，那个是永远过不去的。这个是美国非常可怕的一面。

The U.S. is now pushing its real estate market vigorously. But you know the real estate was what caused the previous financial crisis in the U.S. Like Freddie Mac, these real estate firms were completely nonsense and were a fraud. In the end, they led to a global financial crisis. During that time, the U.S. dollar depreciated sharply. So, the dollars in everyone’s hands now are still called U.S. dollars, but after the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. dollar has depreciated a lot, and even its credit has been extremely damaged and will never go back again. This is a very scary thing about the U.S.

这就(是)为什么现在美国人没闹明白，(美国)还在推房产，两党之间（还在）完全（想着如何）拉选民，是吧？然后现在还要不允许房地产止赎，就是你把房地产赎回去这是不可以的。不允许银行强迫老百姓把房子怎么样，这不就共产主义了吗？共产主义（但）所有金融市场都是私人商业行为，那最终就完蛋了嘛，就这么简单。

That’s why I say Americans still haven’t figured it out now because they are still pushing real estate, and the two parties are still thinking about how to please their voters, right? And now even foreclosure of real estate is not allowed, that is, it is impossible for you [the bank] to reclaim its properties. If banks are not allowed to foreclosure people’s houses, it will be just like communism, right? Communism with all the financial markets still being private businesses will lead to everyone’s deaths. It’s that simple.

所以说货币供应出了问题，整个黄金再被(共产党)偷走，（美国）国家信用出了问题，然后金融市场再出问题……你再拿钱补，你(美国)再印钞票吗？是不可能的。所以（大家）能听到现在，（美国)现在站在一个冰，即将化掉的冰块上。这就是世界政治和世界经济(的现状)。

So now the currency supply has encountered problems, all the gold is being stolen by the CCP, and the credit of the country is problematic, and then the financial market encounters problems too. You want to use money to fill the holes? You want to print more money again? No way! So if you hear me to this point, you will know that the U.S. is like standing on an iceberg, a melting iceberg. This is the current state of world politics and the world economy.
