### **前西維吉尼亞大學教授因參與中華人民共和國“千人計畫”詐騙獲刑**

CLARKSBURG – Dr. James Patrick Lewis, of Fairview, West Virginia, was sentenced today to three months incarceration for a fraud charge involving West Virginia University, the Department of Justice announced.

克拉克斯堡 – 司法部宣佈，西維吉尼亞州費爾維尤市的詹姆斯·派翠克·路易斯博士，因涉嫌與西維吉尼亞大學有關的欺詐指控，今天被判三個月監禁。

Lewis was also fined $9,363 for the cost of the incarceration and ordered to pay $20,189 in restitution to WVU, which is paid in full.

路易斯還被處罰了9,363美元作為監禁費用，並被勒令向西維吉尼亞大學支付20,189美元的賠償（已全額支付）。

Lewis, age 54, pleaded guilty to a one-count information charging him with “Federal Program Fraud.” From 2006 to August 2019, Lewis was a tenured professor at West Virginia University in the physics department, specializing in molecular reactions used in coal conversion technologies. In July 2017, Lewis entered into a contract of employment with the People’s Republic of China through its “Global Experts 1000 Talents Plan.” China’s Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese Talent recruit plans that are designed to attract, recruit, and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China’s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security. These talent programs seek to lure overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information.

現年54歲的路易斯就一項“聯邦項目欺詐”指控認罪。從2006年到2019年8月，路易斯是西維吉尼亞大學物理學系的終身教授，專門研究煤炭轉化技術中的分子反應。 2017年7月，路易斯通過“全球千人專家計畫”與中華人民共和國簽訂了雇用合同。中國的“千人計畫”是中國最著名的人才招募計畫之一，旨在吸引、招募和培養高級科學人才，以促進中國的科學發展、經濟繁榮和國家安全。這些人才計畫旨在吸引海外人才和外國專家，以將他們的知識和經驗帶到中國，並獎勵那些竊取專利資訊的個人。

According to Lewis’s contract, the Chinese Academy of Sciences agreed to employ Lewis as a professor for at least three years. In return, Lewis agreed to maintain an active research program that yielded publications in high quality, peer-reviewed journals, and to provide research training and experience for Chinese Academy of Sciences students.

根據路易斯的合同，中國科學院同意聘用路易斯為教授至少三年時間。作為回報，路易斯同意保持一項活躍的研究專案，它會在高品質的、同行評審的期刊中發表論文，並為中國科學院的學生提供研究培訓和經驗。

As a part of the program, Lewis was promised benefits, including a living subsidy of 1 million Yuan (approximately $143,000), a research subsidy of 4 million Yuan (approximately $573,000), and a salary of 600,000 Yuan (approximately $86,000). To receive the benefits, Lewis would have to work full time in China for three consecutive years, for no less than nine months per year, and would have to begin work no later than Aug. 8, 2018.

作為該計畫的一部分，路易斯被許諾了各項福利，包括人民幣100萬元的生活津貼（約合美元14.3萬）、400萬元的研究補助金（約合美元57.3萬）和60萬元的工資（約合美元86,000）。為了獲得這些福利，路易斯要必須連續三年在中國工作、每年不少於9個月，並且必須在2018年8月8日之前開始工作。

In March 2018, Lewis submitted a request to WVU for an alternate/parental work assignment, requesting to be released from his teaching duties for the fall 2018 semester in order to serve as the primary caregiver for a child he and his wife were expecting in June 2018. In fact, however, Lewis knew this request was fraudulent. Rather than caring for his newborn child, Lewis planned to work in China during the fall 2018 semester as a part of his agreement with the “1000 Talents Plan.” Based on the false justification Lewis offered, WVU granted his request.

2018年3月，路易斯向西維吉尼亞大學提交了一個關於替換/父母工作任務的申請，要求將其從2018年秋季學期的教學職責中釋放出來，以讓他可以作為他們夫妻倆預計2018年6月出生孩子的主要照顧者。但是實際上，路易斯知道這個申請是欺詐性的。路易斯並沒有照顧他的新生嬰兒，而是作為他與“ 千人計畫”協議的一部分，計畫於2018年秋季學期在中國工作。根據路易斯提供的虛假理由，西維吉尼亞大學同意了他的申請。

In the fall of 2018, Lewis spent all but three weeks of the semester in China while his newborn child remained in the United States. During this period, Lewis received his full salary from WVU pursuant to his alternate/parental work assignment. Lewis’s scheme allowed him to fraudulently obtain $20,189 from WVU.

2018年秋天，除了三個星期之外，路易斯在中國度過了整個學期，而他的新生嬰兒卻留在了美國。在此期間，路易斯根據其替代/父母工作任務從西維吉尼亞大學獲得了全薪。路易斯的計謀使他從西維吉尼亞大學騙取了20,189美元。

Lewis is no longer employed by WVU, having resigned in August 2019. He was ordered to self-report to prison in 30 days.

路易斯已於2019年8月辭職，不再受雇于西維吉尼亞大學。他被下令在30天內自行到監獄報到。

Assistant U.S. Attorney　Jarod J. Douglas and Trial Attorney Evan N. Turgeon with the Department of Justice’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, National Security Division, prosecuted　the case on behalf of the government. The FBI and the Internal Revenue Service investigated. WVU cooperated in the investigation of this case.

司法部國家安全司反間諜和出口管制科的助理檢察官賈羅德·J·道格拉斯和審判律師埃文·N·圖根代表政府起訴此案，聯邦調查局和國稅局進行了調查。西維吉尼亞大學在調查此案時給予了合作。
