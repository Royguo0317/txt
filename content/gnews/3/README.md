視頻重點

1. 9月12日中共官媒發表文章稱衛星發射再次失敗。今年以來，中共的衛星、火箭等發射屢遭失敗。
2. CCP病毒在美導致近二十萬人死亡。美國最新一期時代周刊,繼2001年911恐襲事件後,第二次使用黑色封面。
3. 兩週時間內東北迎來三次颱風，正值玉米生長、水稻初長的關鍵時期，颱風過境後一些農作物大片倒伏，主要的糧倉東北 水稻減產嚴重。

5. （Loose Women, 9/11）閻麗夢博士）好的，基因組序列就像我們人的指紋，所以基於這個，你可以識別這個病毒。所以我用SARS-COVID-2的基因組序列中存在的證據，告訴人們為什麼這是來自中共國的實驗室，為什麼他們是唯一製造病毒的人。


1. On September 12, the Chinese Communist Party’s official media announced that the satellite launch failed again. Since the beginning of this year, the CCP’s satellite and rocket launches have repeatedly failed.

5. (Loose Women, 9/11) (Dr. Li-meng Yan) The genome sequence is like our human fingerprint, so based on this you can recognize, identify this thing. So I use the evidence (that) exists in the genome sequence of SARS-COVID-2 to tell people why this is from the lab in Communist China, why they are the only one who made it.
