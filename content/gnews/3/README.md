**摘要：在2021年5月30日的GTV直播中，郭先生说最近美国要求查清病毒真相的民意汹涌，使美中关系、媒体、情报和军方的风向迅速转变，曾经和中共勾兑的美国高层官员受到极大震撼。**

**美国的汹涌民意已震慑美国高层与中共勾兑者****  ****以毒灭共不可逆转**

**US Public Opinion Has Deterred the Top US officials and Those in Collusion with the CCP**

所以说美中关系这一段的这种改变，包括社交媒体，还有所谓的严肃媒体以及美国情报军方，对整个美国现在在美国最高层官员和中共勾兑的这些官员造成的震慑。就是美国人要知道真相、美国人要中共要负责任的呼声，已经大大地震慑了美国高层和中共勾兑的这些人——叫卖美的“美奸”，包括华尔街、好莱坞还有这些太空大佬们、高科技大佬们，极大地震撼了他们。因为共产党的邪恶已经远远地超出他们所能承受的能力。

So we have seen the recent changes in the US-China relationship, in the social media, in the so-called mainstream media, and in the US intelligence and military community. The top US officials and those who were in bed with the Chinese Communist Party have really been shocked. It was the American people demanding for the truth of the virus and asking to hold the CCP accountable that greatly rocked the US high level officials and those who have colluded with the CCP. These people are called traitors for they have sold American people’s interests to others, including Wall Street, Hollywood, and those space tycoons and high-tech moguls. These people were greatly shocked. Because the evilness of the CCP has far exceeded what they can bear.

美国人民的力量，美国这个国家绝对是民意决定、最终决定一切。民意汹涌地到来，以及民意要求这个病毒的真相，以及民意迅速的改变，从百分之35%到75%现在可以消灭共产党、中国共产党不等同于中国人民、中国共产党不等同于中国、中国人民是好的、共产党是邪恶的、共产党的这个主义是邪恶的，这是不可思议的。

Everything in the US is ultimately determined by the strength and public opinion of the American people. The public opinion is now demanding to find the truth about the virus and it is so strong and rapidly going from 35% to the current 75% for supporting the elimination of the CCP and supporting the notion such as the CCP is not equivalent to the Chinese people, the CCP is not equivalent to China, the Chinese people are great, the CCP is evil, and communism is wicked. These changes are so incredible.

在一年前是35%的人这么认为，甚至还二十几，现在达到75%。过去是95%的媒体绝不正面谈共产党的邪恶，也不挑战共产党的权威。现在绝大数媒体已经开始认为共产党是邪恶的，这个世界的这种所有的灾难，最后的追根究底是共产党。

A year ago, only 35% of people thought so, or even only about 20%, but now it has reached 75%. In the past, 95% of the media would never talk publicly about the immorality of the CCP, nor would they challenge the authority of the CCP, but now the vast majority of the media has started to believe that the CCP is vicious and that the CCP is the ultimate reason for all the world’s calamities.

所以兄弟姐妹们，这个时刻需要我们有耐心、需要我们搂住，我们大概还要等到今年九月份以后，到年底才能达到高潮。9月份以前，不管发生什么，都会有变数、都会有起伏。

So brothers and sisters, it is the time to hold your horses and be patient. We probably have to wait until after September this year, or to the end of the year to reach the peak [of our movement]. Before September, no matter what happens, there will still be variables and plenty of ebb and flow.

今年不要忘了去年的庚子年、霹雳年，今年是辛丑年，今年是真正的共产党结束的关键一年。但是即使这样，我认为共产党的结束还要在2024年、2025年之间。2024、2025年之间，它的变数就在于中国绝大多数老百姓被洗脑太严重、无知。最终的以共灭共还受到这种挑战。它还有这么些年的经济体，中国老百姓还有饭吃，只有没饭吃的时候，这些家底全花完的时候，这些90%的人，还有那10%的人的一小部分人才能醒过来。

Let’s not forget that last year is the *Gengzi year*, the year of the “thunderbolt”. This year is the year of the *Xinchou*, which is the truly crucial year for the extermination of the CCP. But even so, I expect the end of CCP will be between the year 2024 and 2025.  The variables lie in the fact that the vast majority of the Chinese people are too ignorant due to the on-going brainwash by the CCP, which will make the final battle, that uses the internal strife of the CCP to destroy the CCP itself, become challenging. Besides, the CCP’s economy is quite established after so many years’ growth, and the Chinese people still have food to eat. Only when there is no food to eat, no money to spend, the 90% of the people, and a small percentage of the 10% of the people would wake up.

第二个，美国被中共渗透的太厉害，这一届政府当中很多人，并不一定敢来真正动手灭中共。

Second, the United States has deeply been infiltrated by the CCP, and many people in this administration don’t have the guts to take real actions to eliminate the CCP.

所以说这两个原因，我们很可能到2024、2025，但有10%的可能，在这个中间擦枪走火，美国这届的军队还是很了不起的，这届军方的人会很果敢，欧洲是很坚决的，那么欧洲和美国军队一旦合作起来，也有可能就是斩首，有10%的可能。但是90%的可能我认为在2024、2025共产党彻底结束。

Due to those two reasons, we’re very likely to win by 2024 or 2025, but there is also a 10% chance of an unexpected incident between the two countries occurring. The US military of this administration is still extraordinary, the leaders of the military are resolute and courageous; Europe is also very determined.  Once the Europeans cooperate with the US military, there will be a 10% chance to launch the operation of decapitation. But I think there is a 90% chance that the CCP will come to a complete end in 2024 or 2025.
