简述：郭先生在2021年4月3日的GTV直播中透彻地分析了共产党的强盗逻辑：只有共产党是好的、是神，资本主义、美国、香港、台湾，包括中共14亿老百姓都是坏的。 他说：“这个逻辑你看明白了，你再看共产党的时候你什么事都看得很清楚了。”

**共产党认为自己是神****  ****所以要灭掉所有的神**

**CCP Thinks It Is the God, So It Can Kill All Gods**

按照共产党的说法，就所有这美帝国主义的东西都是骗子都垃圾，都是资本主义的嘛，是不是？只有共产党的是好的，对吧？ 就共产党你看它干啥事？共产党说我是无神主义，对吧，我是无神主义，所以我把所有的神要杀掉。佛教、穆斯林、新疆人、基督教最近抓得一塌糊涂，天主教、道教到处扫荡。为什么？因为我是神，我要当神我就要灭掉所有的神。大家我说的是事实吧？几年前七哥就说了吧？

According to the CCP, all things of American imperialism are crooks and rubbish for they are all capitalist, right? Only the Communist Party is good, right? Just look at what the CCP is doing. The CCP says I am atheist, so I’m going to kill all the gods. Recently Buddhists, Muslims, Xinjiang people, and Christians have been arrested massively. Catholics and Taoists have been wiped out in many places. Why? Because I am God, and to be a god, I must destroy all other gods. Everyone, do you admit that what I’m telling you is the truth? Has Brother Miles already told you this a few years ago?

第二，资本主义是邪恶的，剥削阶级，是吧？看那私人企业家，是不是啊，你们解决了百分之七十、八十的中国就业问题。什么马云啊，什么许家印啊，万达啊，是吧，叶简明啊，吴小晖啊，肖建华啊，是吧，还有什么刚刚抓捕的搞了无数个孩子的，包括那个什么那个民生啊，董文标是吧，还有张宏伟啊，是吧这些人，抓一堆的张宏伟的家人是吧，就这些人，你们私人企业家，百分之八十就业。是啊，你就玩的就业了，国家还是以国营企业为主。始终国有企业牢牢地抓住这个中国的钱把子、钱袋子，要以国有企业为主。

Second, capitalism is evil because they are the exploiting class, right? Look at the private entrepreneurs who created 70 to 80% of China’s jobs. Those like Jack Ma, Xu Jiayin, the Wanda Group, Ye Jianming, Wu Xiaohui, Xiao Jianhua, also the guy who was just arrested for raping countless young kids, the Minsheng Bank, Dong Wenbiao, and Zhang Hongwei whose family members were mostly arrested, these private entrepreneurs solved 80% of the employment problem. Regardless, the country is still dominated by state-owned enterprises. State-owned enterprises firmly control the moneybags of China and are deemed as the mainstream.

那么，啥意思啊？国有企业是谁的？是党的，党产，党始终要说了算。爹亲娘亲都不如党亲，一切都是党的，一切听党的。怎么办？我要有钱，我要当资本家，我把你所有资本家全抓了。共产党这个流氓逻辑：我要当神，我就把神全灭了，我当唯一的神；全中国的所有的企业家，我要当老大，全抓了。抓了吧？一个不给你剩。你看着马化腾这两天还涨呢，马化腾一定是这结局，死不了活不了。它不会让他死的，马云可能弄死他，马化腾不一定弄死他。一定这结局啊，就是让所有天下的钱都是它的，然后杀掉所有有钱人。

So, what does that mean? Who owns the state-owned enterprises? The party. They are the party’s properties and the party always has the final say because “parents are not as intimate as the party”, “everything belongs to the party”, and “you should listen to the party on everything”. How? I, the CCP want to be rich, I want to be a capitalist, so I need to arrest all the capitalists. The gangster logic of the CCP is: I want to be a god, so I ought to destroy all gods, so that I can be the only god; I want to be the boss of all the entrepreneurs in China, so I can arrest all of them. No one can get away. You see Ma Huateng’s stock is still rising the last couple of days, but Ma Huateng will definitely end up like this – can’t die and can’t live either. It won’t let him die, Jack Ma could be killed, but Ma Huateng may not be killed. But the ending will definitely be like this, that is, all the money in the world will belong to the CCP, and then it will kill all the rich people.

我说你看到没有，这就是共产党 ，它让全世界人民把全世界都说成是流氓、痞子文化，都是假的，动不动就骂这个国家什么痞子，骂美国骂什么骂全世界包括我们爆料革命。它是世界最大的黑帮。它天天喊着我这个狮子醒来了，这个狮子醒来跟你共产党啥球关系啊？14亿人民也不是在70年前才出生的，中国人几千年的文明文化了，跟你共产党啥关系啊？

Have you seen that? This is the CCP. It criticizes all the people in the whole world to be hooligans, rogues and fake. They always scold a country as a ruffian or scold the United States and scold the whole world, including us, the Whistleblower Movement. But itself is the biggest gang in the world. It says the lion [referred to China] has woken up everyday, but does it have anything to do with you, the CCP? The 1.4 billion people were not only born since 70 years ago. The Chinese have a civilization and culture existing for thousands of years. What does it have to do with you, the Communist Party?

它要挑战全世界，全世界没有好人就它一个好人，然后这些好人当中，它管…因为它是好人，它管着14亿全是坏人。它要当好人，谁也不能当好人，这又是共产党的流氓逻辑。香港，没好东西，抓！杀！台湾收回！中国人不打中国人，只杀中国人，只杀你中国人，干掉台湾。我说这就是流氓的共产党，兄弟姐妹们。这个逻辑你看明白了，你再看共产党的时候你什么事都看得很清楚了。

It wants to challenge the whole world like there is no other good person in the world but itself. So, it should manage all the people, manage all 1.4 billion bad people. Because it is the only good guy, so nobody else can be good. This is, again, the CCP’s hooligan logic. In Hong Kong, nothing is good, so I can arrest them and kill them! Taiwan, we must take it back! Chinese don’t fight against Chinese? So they only KILL Chinese. They only kill Chinese, and also want to get rid of Taiwan. This is the gangster CCP, brothers and sisters. If you understand this logic, you will find everything about the CCP becomes crystal clear.
