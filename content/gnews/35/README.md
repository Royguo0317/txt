**以毒灭共、以钱灭共在欧美持续发酵中**

**The Progress of Taking Down the CCP by Spreading the Truth About the Virus and Through Financial Activities in America and Europe**

00:35-00:01:39

从昨天到今天大家看到发生什么事情了吗？这个以毒灭共、以钱灭共是什么情况的发生？整个美国现在白宫、五角大楼、国会山、保守派会议，还有所谓的激进派，都在干什么呢？毒是哪来的？都在弄嘛哈。

Have you seen what happened yesterday and today? Have you noticed the results from our strategy of taking down the CCP by spreading the truth about the virus and through financial activities? People across America, in the White House, in the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill, at the CPAC’s gatherings, and among the so-called radicals -do you know what they are doing? They are all learning where the virus came from. They are all learning about it.

欧洲所有的国家，共产党天天制裁那个，制裁那个的，瞎球折腾。现在不用制裁了，现在大量的，它现在给人家加关税。国内的各种原材料大涨价，经济一塌糊涂，金融崩溃。

The CCP threatened European countries in various ways to force them to accept their will. Now instead they are talking about imposing tariffs. There are already inflationary pressures on all kinds of raw materials in mainland China. The CCP’s economy is in shambles, facing a financial collapse.

现在好多国家要把香港列为制裁区，中共的匪区，制裁区。什么概念，兄弟姐妹们？香港的金融就将崩塌。

Many countries have listed Hong Kong as a sanctionable area – an area controlled by the CCP bandits. What does this mean, brothers and sisters? It means that Hong Kong’s financial system is about to collapse.

**01:44-01:57**

接下来，把香港打成和大陆一样的待遇以后，大家去想想，会是什么样的待遇，什么样的感觉？

Hong Kong will be indistinguishable from mainland China. Think about it, what would that be like, what would it feel like?

**02:48-07:42**

我说以毒灭共的时候，没有几个人，包括我们的路波切，我们的科学家，不明白我的意思。那马里克回香港，啥感觉？我刚才给路波切、科学家说，马里克回香港啥也不是，就是想把他圈在香港，不让他出去，别到美国、西方这儿来，或者被做掉，或者说把所有的秘密提供给西方。这是根本，这是一个根本的根本。还要控制病毒在整个全世界的，新病毒蔓延和发展，包括疫苗。

When I started the strategy of “taking down the CCP by spreading the truth about the virus”, not many people understood, including Lude and our scientist Dr. Li-Meng Yan. Why did Malik return to Hong Kong? I just told Lude and Dr. Yan that the only reason Malik returned to Hong Kong was that the CCP wanted him to be under control. They want to make sure he does not leave for the US or Europe and that he does not get killed or tell the West the truth about the virus. That is the point. This is the essence. The CCP will continue to spread new viruses around the world and control the vaccines.

这就是共产党的疯狂。它永远把在奴役中国人的侥幸成功，真正的认为自己的天下的能力，天下的无所不能的超自然能力。它以为每次以假、以黑、以贪、以警治国的这些招儿在全世界管用。这就是上天，给一些坏人一些特别能力的时候，他真以为自己与众不同了。

This is the madness of the CCP. The CCP always believe that they are the God and have superpowers to enslave the Chinese people forever. The CCP think they are powerful enough to control the world by fraud, dirty tricks, corruption, and force. When they got unrestricted power, these rulers mistakenly  thought that they are so unique that they can do  whatever they want.

最终，这些东西会导致他的灭亡。毋庸置疑的。包括现在大家看到的，整个全世界，没有多少人敢跟共产党做生意的。现在佛罗里达保守党大会、德州，就连加州议员都有人提出来跟共产党的来往必须按照美国法律，限定你什么时间内来上报你跟它来往的细节、中间联络人，包括收受的礼物、吃饭和住的地方，联络方式，怕被蓝金黄。

In the end, their craziness will definitely lead to their demise. There is no doubt about it. And, as we can see now, it is rare that people around the world want to do business with China. Now at the CPAC conference in Florida, in Texas, and even a senator from California made the point that any contact with the CCP must obey the US law and that the details must be reported within a specified time, including who you contacted, what gifts you received, where you stayed and ate, the contact methods, all to prevent people from being BGY-ed by the CCP.

你想想，保守的欧洲，德国、比利时这样的国家，所有议员在欧洲议会上都提出来，还有瑞士，说如果所有欧洲的官员和中共打交道不能公开透明的话，就不能再做官员。特别大屠杀这个事情，又被拜登政府再次确认，就是大屠杀。这场博弈，最近听拜登政府的人跟我说，现在拜登政府的人跟共产党谁再见面，都害怕了。头一段时间都去Ambassador Cui，崔大使那儿成为时髦。但是最近，没人敢，害怕了都，说共产党老拿来威胁，共产党啊，老拿来威胁，咋办呢？谁都害怕。

Think about it. In conservative European countries such as Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland, parliamentarians have proposed that any European official who is not open and transparent in their contacts with the CCP cannot be an official. Specifically, on the “Xinjiang Genocide”, the Biden administration has further confirmed this designation. I just heard from someone in the Biden administration that no one would dare to meet with the CCP at this point. They are all scared. A while ago, these people called it fashionable to visit the CCP’s ambassador Cui Tiankai, but recently they are afraid, and no one dares to go there anymore. They said that the CCP always threatened them. What to do? They are all scared.

所以说，共产党这个王八蛋犊子。我跟你说，这就是个纯粹的流氓组织，还把自己代表人民、代表党，还什么江山是人民的。江山是谁的都不应该是你共产党的，这是个起码的常识，是不是，兄弟姐妹们？我说的有道理吧？有道理不？是不是？这是个起码的常识，是谁的都不应该是你共产党的。

So, the CCP is a bastard. I tell you what, the CCP is completely a rogue organization. They say that they represent the Chinese people and that the country belongs to the people. No matter who the country belongs to, it should not belong to you – the CCP. It is common sense, isn’t it, brothers and sisters? Am I right? It is fundamental common sense that whoever it belongs to, it should not belong to you, the CCP!

还有一个，兄弟姐妹们，你们看到这几天日本、俄罗斯有啥变化？俄罗斯现在就是要钱，拿钱拿钱，天天要钱，就是在它死了以前把它腰包里的钱掏光了，就这么简单。日本现在装弱，示弱，哎呀，不敢惹你啊，你是大爷，你是大爷，你是九指妖，是吧？但是，私下里边能把技术撤的就撤了，能把日本的东西拿回去就拿回去，能把所有的日本的这个高端的东西拿回去就拿回去。竟然，在珠海的高尔夫球场都被通知要撤回，你想这有多可怕啊？这是什么概念？

On the other hand, brothers and sisters, have you noticed what has changed in Japan and Russia these days? Russia asks the CCP for money every day, “Give me the money! Money! Money!” It’s about emptying the CCP’s pockets before its death, simple as that. Japan pretends it is weak, showing weakness, “CCP, I will never challenge you, you’re the boss.”

You are like the “nine-fingered demoness Sara (VOG)”, Okay? But, privately, Japan is bringing all the technology, money, and high-tech projects back to Japan as quickly as they can. Even the golf course in Zhuhai has received orders to retreat. Do you realize how terrible this is? What does that mean?

看到蓬佩奥说了吗？ 中美经济脱钩是必须的、必然的，而且是应该马上的。看到我们皮特纳瓦罗说“Take down the CCP! Take down the CCP!” 兄弟姐妹们，咱的30招，在川普总统如果没被这个巴尔给干掉的话，共产党已经进棺材板了。但是这30招，据我所说，拜登政府认为这是不错啊，现在捡起来，感觉不错啊。

Have you heard what Mike Pompeo said? “The decoupling between the US and the CCP is necessary, inevitable, and should happen immediately.” Do you hear what our (friend) Peter Navarro is saying? “Take down the CCP! Take down the CCP!” Brothers and sisters, we suggested 30 Executive Orders for the Trump administration. If they were not obstructed by William Barr, the CCP would have been dead already. Nevertheless, as far as I know, the Biden administration thinks the 30 EOs look good. They feel good when they have them in their hands.

昨天对我最好的消息就是听说，他们要把这30招下去，要进行下去。这对咱是个好消息吧。七哥原来跟你们说什么，拜登政府一旦要灭共反而比川普还反共。

I was told a piece of wonderful news yesterday – that the Biden administration will carry out these 30 EOs. Is it good for us? Do you recall what I told you before? -Once the Biden administration makes up their minds to take down the CCP, it will be even harsher and faster than Trump.”

**09:10-09:32**

听这个最近内部的人说，咱战友说，现在每个人都觉得这拜登上来，不但日子没好过，更难过了。说这个川普总统的政府啊，还有的事还是能过得去的；说拜登这帮人上来以后啊，这个荤素不吃，浑不吝。你说，这是啥感觉？

Recently, our fellow fighter inside [the CCP] told me that it was much more difficult to deal with the Biden administration than Trump’s. He said that things were negotiable with the Trump administration, but the Biden administration doesn’t accept any conditions. How do you feel about that?
