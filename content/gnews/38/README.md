## The Michigan Battleground

## 密歇根战场州

Figure Four tabulates by category a total of 446,803 potentially illegal votes in Michigan. This is almost three times the alleged Biden victory margin of 154,818 votes.

图四按类别列出了密歇根州总共446,803张潜在的非法选票。这几乎是所谓的拜登154,818获胜优势票数的三倍。

The largest amount of ballots in question in Michigan stems from inexplicable vote tabulation surges along with alleged voting machine irregularities and ballots counted despite lacking voter-registration numbers.

密歇根州选票争议最多的是所说的投票机违规而引起的莫名其妙的投票激增，以及缺乏选民注册号却仍计票。

There were also two major questionable “Biden vote spikes” in the early hours of November 4th. At 3:50 AM EST, Michigan added 54,497 additional ballots cast for Joe Biden and just 4,718 votes cast for President Trump.1 At 6:31 AM EST, an update showed an additional 141,258 votes cast for Biden, while President Trump received just 5,968 additional ballots.

还有两个主要的可疑“拜登票数激增”发生在11月4日凌晨。在美国东部时间上午3:50，密歇根州为乔·拜登增加了54,497张票，而川普总统只有4,718张票。在美国东部时间上午6:31，更新显示为拜登又新增141,258张票，而川普总统仅新增5,968张票。

Additionally, it is illegal in Michigan to count absentee ballots without having corresponding voter registration numbers for corresponding precincts, according to state law. Despite this, election officials allowed over 174,000 of these ballots to be counted anyway. 20

此外，没有相应选区的选民登记号而计算缺席选票在密歇根州是非法的。尽管如此，选举官员仍然允许计入超过174,000的选票。

Michigan also processed ballots of over 35,000 voters without addresses on state records, at least over 480 confirmed dead voters, and over 13,200 voters registered to vote in other states—in blatant violation of state election law. Lastly, over 27,800 ballots were requested under the name of a registered voter without their knowledge and/or consent.

密歇根州还处理了超过35,000名在州记录中没有地址的选民的选票，至少480名经确认的过世选民，以及13200名在其他州登记投票的选民-这公然违反了州选举法。最后，27,800多张选票是在注册选民不知情和/或未经同意的情况下申请的。

## The Nevada Battleground

## 内华达战场州

Figure Five tabulates by category a total of 220,008 potentially illegal votes in Nevada. This is roughly six times the alleged Biden victory margin of 33,596 votes.

图五按类别列出了内华达州总共220,008张潜在的非法选票。这大概是所谓的拜登33,596获胜优势票数的六倍。

Nevada’s largest irregularities stemmed from the use of the Agilis signature-matching machines installed in Clark County to verify signatures on ballots. Using machines instead of people for signature match verification is in blatant violation of state law and calls into question the 130,000 ballots verified by these Agilis machines.

内华达州最大的违规之处是在克拉克县使用安装了Agilis签名匹配机来核实选票上的签名。使用机器代替人工进行签名匹配验证公然违反了州法律，且让人质疑这130,000张经过Agilis机器验证的选票。

The Agilis machines were also alleged to have not been operated “in conformance with the manufacturer’s recommendations” on Election Day. First, the images on file used by the Agilis machine to compare to the signatures on the outside of the mail-in ballots were of lower image quality than “suggested by the manufacturer” for the machine to operate properly, and the machine was altered or adjusted by election officials to a setting “lower than the manufacturer’s recommendations,” making the machine unreliable.

据称，Agilis机器在选举日未按照制造商的建议进行操作。 首先，Agilis机器用来比较邮寄选票外部签名的所属文件的图像质量低于“制造商建议”的能使机器正常工作的图像质量，并且机器被更改或被选举官员调整为“低于制造商建议”的设置，从而使机器不可靠。

Nevada also registered 42,284 double voters, ascertained by reviewing the list of voters and comparing voters with the same name, address, and date of birth—a method shown in peer reviewed papers to have over 99% accuracy. That category alone exceeds the alleged Biden victory margin of 33,596 votes.

内华达州还登记了42,284名双重选民，这是通过审查选民名单并比较具有相同姓名、地址和出生日期的选民来确定的-同行评审论文中显示这种方法具有99％以上的准确性。单是这一类别就超过了所谓的拜登获胜优势选票33,596票。

In addition, 19,218 out-of-state voters cast ballots in Nevada. This was ascertained by lining up voter lists from all counties against publicly available USPS records on permanent change of addresses with other states and correcting for military and student voters.

另外，有19,218名州外选民在内华达州进行了投票。通过将所有县的选民名单与公开的USPS记录中的在其他州永久更改的地址进行比较，并校正军事和学生选民的名单，可以确定这一点。

Finally, 1,506 votes were cast in the name of deceased persons—verified by comparing mail voters with social security death records. Over 8,000 ballots were cast by persons without addresses—found by referencing voters with the Coding Accuracy Support System and finding undeliverable addresses. 4,000 non-U.S. citizens also appear to have voted—found by comparing non-citizen DMV records to the list of voters.

最后，1,506张选票是以过世者的名义投的-通过比较邮寄选民和社会保障死亡记录进行核实。8,000多张由无地址的人投的票-通过参考选民编码准确性支持系统并发现无法交付的地址。4,000名非美国公民也参加了投票-通过比较非公民DMV记录和选民名单发现。
