英文標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep 214-215:  over 100 million Americans’ personal information may have been stolen by TikTok

視頻簡介

1. TikTok可能盜取了1億美國人的個人信息，中共黨媒環球網為TikTok起訴川普政府虛張聲勢。面對川普堅定的脫鉤策略，中共指使抖音在美國起訴川普政府。
2. 紅色恐怖下的新疆人的生活。在新疆某地禁止百姓宣洩不滿，中共禁止在社交媒體傳消息，當局擔心傳到互聯網上讓世界知道中共的暴行。
3. 中國說疫情不會人傳人，結果疫情人傳人；中共說病毒不會大流行，結果病毒大流行；現在中共勸大家不要屯糧，明白該做什麼了嗎？
4. (8/24）（Steve Bannon）中國宣布他們已經開發出了疫苗，他們正試圖讓人們接種，看起來他們已經開始利用疫苗來秀肌肉。備受爭議的郭文貴先生，兩三個月前說，他們（中共）永遠不會把那個（基因組序列）給你，因為他們就是想占領疫苗的高地，向全世界宣布：“嘿，你們得向我們叩頭，因為我們可以拯救世界。”
5. (郭文貴先生，8/25）如果（這些地方）“一中”政策都沒了，拜登，民主黨這大會，就這一句，就這一個政策，勝過千千萬。你們一定要意識到，那共產黨那就不是說你是非法政府合法政府了，你就是犯罪集團了你。


1. In America, over 100 million Americans’ personal information may have been stolen by TikTok, the latter filed a lawsuit against the Trump’s administration, which was revealed by the Global Times – the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) media. Such a lawsuit was obviously instructed by CCP.
2. Life in Xinjiang under Red Terror. In one part of Xinjiang where expressing personal grievances is forbidden, the CCP has blocked the information on social media in fear of letting the world know about the atrocities committed by the Chinese Communist Party.
3. The CCP said the virus would not transmit between people, but it turns out it did; the CCP said that the virus would not cause a global pandemic, we are living in it every day; Now the CCP advises everyone not to store food, well, you know what you have to do?
4. (Steve Bannon) The Chinese announced that they’ve got [guess what] a vaccine. They’re trying putting people on a vaccine. It looks like they’re trying to show their muscle. The controversial Miles Guo, said 2 or 3 monthes ago, they (CCP) are never gonna give that (genome sequence)  to you because what they want to do is get on top of a vaccine and then come forward to the world and say “Hey we’re the saviors of the world you’ve got to kow-tow to us.”
5. (Miles Guo, 8/25) If “One China policy” is removed, Joe Biden, the DNC (Demoncratic National Convention), this policy alone works better than a thousand others. You must understand, if that happens, then the issue is not only whether or not the CCP is a  legitimate government, but the CCP will be deemed a criminal gang.
