**路德:**
《环球新军事》说，
The CCP’s Global New Military news said
中共国航母罕见出动
that the dispatch of Chinese aircraft carrier is rarely seen

美国航母一看就灰溜溜离开
but the US aircraft carrier left dejectedly as soon as seeing it

看看它怎么对内洗脑忽悠的
Let’s see how this report is brainwashing and deceptive to its readers

它说中共舰队将美军给堵住了
It said that the US army had been blocked by the CCP’s fleet

辽宁舰旁边的055型导弹驱逐舰，南昌舰
Either 055 missile destroyer or Nanchang warship beside the Liaoning aircraft carrier

它绝对是一座移动的火力堡垒
It is absolutely a moving firepower fortress

其超过万吨的身躯，综合作战能力
its body weighted more than 10K tons with an integrative combat capability

已超过美军提康德罗加级导弹巡逻舰
And has surpassed the US Ticonderoga missile patrol ship

美军因为惧怕这个导弹驱逐舰所以灰溜溜地离开
The US military left dejectedly is because of the fear of this missile destroyer

忽悠习神的。为什么我们今天说这个？
It’s a hoax to Xi God. Why do we mention this today？

这篇就是写给中南坑习神看的
The report is written to Xi God in Zhongnan hai

就跟当年写给那个慈禧太后
Just like the report written to Empress Dowager Cixi back then

你看被我们义和团给吓着了吧。美国是纸老虎
You see, they are scared by CCP’s “Boxers”. The America is a paper tiger

习神看了以后很开心
Xi God was very happy after reading it

你看，（美军舰）跟我们一对就跑了
You see, (US warship) ran away once encounter with CCP’s fleet

他知道航母肯定搞不过别人
The CCP knew that their aircraft carrier would not be able to defeat over others

所以就说因为我们有导弹驱逐舰，所以美军就害怕了
because CCP had missile destroyer, so the report said that the US army was afraid then.

自我意淫。我们从逻辑上来看，中共的导弹驱逐舰有多落后?
Self-daydream. Let’s look logically how backward the CCP’s missile destroyer is?

它觉得就是因为一万吨，当然了
The CCP thought because the displacement of the destroyer is 10K tons. Of course

这个东西一定是对中南坑习神还有中共统治下的14亿老百姓
this report is certainly shown for Xi God of Zhongnan Hai and 1.4 billion people under the rule of CCP

它是有洗脑作用的
it has the brainwashing effect

它现在就是介于驱逐舰和巡洋舰之间搞了一个大型的驱逐舰
At present, the CCP just built a larger destroyer between the current destroyer and the cruiser

中共的创新就这个概念，比如一辆车本来是帕萨特的底盘
This is CCP’s concept of innovation. Like a car has a Passat chassis originally

然后用帕萨特的底盘改装成一个越野车
then it is refitted into an SUV with Passat chassis.

你看这就是我们的创新能力
You see, this is CCP’s innovation capability

我们的创新能力就体现在这里
Its innovation capability is embodied here

这个驱逐舰充分的体系(现)了中共所谓我们就是善于改装
This destroyer fully reflects what the CCP so-called “We are good at refitting”

我直接把驱逐舰变成巡洋舰
They directly turned the destroyer into a cruiser

变大，装的导弹多了，这就是我们的创新
Make it bigger and carry more missiles. This is their innovation

这就是中共内部自我意淫的
This is what the CCP’s self-daydream is

真正美国的创新是从无到有
The American real innovation starts from scratch

中共的所谓创新，就像华为手机
The so-called innovation of the CCP is like Huawei’s mobile phone

换个壳，漂亮一点，换个摄像头，这就叫创新
Redesign a case, nicer looking and replace a better camera. This is called innovation

用德国最好的赛思(蔡司)的摄像头，这就叫创新
Equipped with German’s best Zeiss lens, this is called innovation

他们永远都停留在这个意义上
They will always stay in this sense

刚刚博博士给我发私信，他说（中共）胡扯
Just now Dr. Bo sent me a text message. He said (CCP is) bullshit

055根本没有去南海，知道吧
You know it , the 055 missile destroyer didn’t go to the South China Sea at all
