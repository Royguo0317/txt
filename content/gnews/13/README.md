## 香港经济危在旦夕，台湾命悬一线，中共逃不过病毒的制裁

新闻简述：在2021年3月16日的盖特视频中，郭先生说（1）香港储备金告急，经济命悬一线；（2）懦弱的台湾蔡英文政府求世界不要插手，但是只要中共敢对台湾有什么举动，世界会自动对中共开战，美国的战略模糊期已经彻底结束；（3）因为病毒，美国两党和欧盟各国已经空前统一、同仇敌忾，中共想继续耍花招、搞蓝金黄，必不能得逞。

**香港经济危在旦夕，台湾命悬一线，中共逃不过病毒的制裁**

**Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the CCP Virus**

我接着说一下，其它政治经济方面的。香港，我们获得[了]足够的信息和证据。我们彻底地经过核实后[是这样]：香港政府，它整个是5000多亿美元的所谓的他那个经济盘子，有1000多亿是政府所谓的，就是咱所说的储备金。现在香港政府给中共紧急报告：香港政府的储备金已经是用完啦。现在都是假的了。那么主要是靠所谓中共中央、国有企业，还有香港交易所，还有国有企业，以及中国的几个银行。所谓的在那拿自己钱盖来盖去，10个瓶子两个盖儿，甚至是没盖儿，靠着电脑经济在那块儿弄。

Let me continue with some other stuff on politics and the economy. We’ve gathered enough evidence and intelligence about Hong Kong. After thorough verification, we’ve come to the fact that the economic volume under the control of the Hong Kong government is about 500 billion USD, 100 billion USD of which is what we call the capital reserve. Now the Hong Kong government has sent an urgent report to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), saying that the Hong Kong’s capital reserve has run out. Now everything is fake. [Everything] is mainly relying on the CCP’s central committee, the state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the Hong Kong stock exchange and several Chinese Banks. [The CCP] moves its own money around like “lids” being put on “bottles”, and there might be just two lids for ten bottles, or no lid at all. And they might just rely on computers to fake everything.

现在历史上从来没出现过，大量的顺差逆差的外汇和贸易，这两个形成了矛盾。香港现在的民生还有物价，特别是民生成本，越来越高。然后大量的资金外移，可能会形成香港股市的雪崩效应，突然间大家都卖股票，然后香港的房市可能忽然间都卖[房]。再一个就是香港突然间出现某种突发事件，集体外汇撤资，香港就成空城了。香港不是臭城，也不是死城，香港成了空城。这种情况下[怎么办]，[有人]给中央紧急提示，如何解决这些问题？香港真的是危在旦夕呀。

It has never happened in history that there existed such massive trade surpluses and deficits and flows of currencies, which creates conflicts. Hong Kong’s current goods’ prices and typical living expenses are going higher and higher. With massive amounts of capital moving out of town, Hong Kong’s stock market’s “avalanche” effect might be waiting, leading to all people selling their stocks in the stock market and selling properties in the housing market. Another thing is that when some emergencies happen, foreign enterprises would rush to withdraw their investment all together, then Hong Kong will become an empty town. Rather than a stinky or a dead town, Hong Kong will become an empty town. How do we deal with these circumstances? Someone has urgently brought attention to the CCP’s Central Committee. Hong Kong is on the verge of death.

这是一个，第二个就台湾这个。目前，台湾你不管蔡英文你给谁磕头，你怎么害怕，求爷爷告奶奶别打我。“你们别在这儿扯事啊，我害怕！”没用。据我所知，欧洲、日本、美国，都在私下商量。如果这样了，台湾怎么办？如果那样了怎么办？不管如何，大家都知道，现在中共是一定要对台湾有动作的。有动作了以后，你动不动手，还是不动手？

This is the first thing, and the second one is about Taiwan. Currently in Taiwan, no matter to whom Tsai Ing-wen will kowtow, and no matter how she’s scared, begging everywhere not to attack Taiwan, “You guys please don’t cause any trouble here [in Taiwan] because I am so scared!” It will be useless. As far as I know, Europe, Japan, and the US are all talking with each other secretly, “If things go this direction, what do we do about Taiwan? And if it goes the other direction, what do we do?” No matter what will happen, people know that the CCP will for sure take actions against Taiwan. If they make the move, will you [the West] act accordingly or not?

现在非常好的事情是，多次差点儿动手，停下来以后，现在基本上[分别]叫做投降派和战争派，现在投降派投了那么多次了。现在在美国欧洲包括日本，在西方所有国家[的人]都知道，你继续投降下去，共产党就把台湾干掉了，干掉台湾[以后]，就干全世界啦。那么就是，你要保台湾，大家知道，就是保自己。共匪不会到你家来。这个整个战略意识的颠倒和重新认识，让西方知道，必须把老共先灭了，或者老共对台湾动手，咱大家一起把它灭了。

A good thing now is that they were on the verge of a war multiple times already, and after it was halted, now [you can see that] there are basically two sides: the pro-war side and the surrender side. And the surrender side has already surrendered multiple times. Now in the US and Europe, including Japan, everyone in western countries has realized that if you keep giving in, the CCP will take over Taiwan. After that, it’s going to take over the whole world. Everyone knows that protecting Taiwan is protecting yourself, so the CCP bandits won’t come to your homes. The whole strategy needs to be re-directed and re-established, so that the West will come to understand that they must take down the CCP first, or if the CCP attacks Taiwan first, everyone will work together to take down the CCP.

这个是没有商量的，已经由不得你台湾在那块儿求爷爷告奶奶啦，已经没用啦！这个形势，大家会看到，接下来，随着病毒的白皮书和香港人权的白皮书，对台湾的一系列类似于白皮书[的出炉]，[西方]会明确表态，比如说你打台湾，你怎么动台湾，你怎么威胁台湾，我们自动开打。也就是所谓的给中共设下明确的、清晰的红线。

This is now nonnegotiable, and has no room for Taiwan to beg anybody – begging is already useless. Under these circumstances, what everybody will see next is that, after the “white paper” reports about the virus and Hong Kong’s human rights, as well as a series of similar documents on Taiwan come out, the West will make it clear that, “If you [the CCP] attacks, touches, or threatens Taiwan in certain ways, we will start a war immediately.” And that is the so-called drawing a clear “red line” for the CCP.

过去这几十年，关键是美国和欧洲，还包括日本，是对所谓的台湾的定位“战略模糊法”让糊弄了几十年。“你说打吧，我帮不帮台湾啊？”“不一定。”“肯不肯定打呢？”“也不一定，是吧？”“如果咱要是军机在台湾转几圈，打不打呢？”“也不一定。”但是，有人会说：“哎，我会打！”所以就叫战略模糊法。

The problem was that in the past several decades, the US, Europe and Japan have been playing the so-called “strategic ambiguity” on the issue of Taiwan. It’s like “Let’s say, if the war breaks out, will I help Taiwan?” “Maybe, or maybe not.” “Will the war break out or not?” “That’s also not a sure thing, right?” “When our military aircrafts are hovering over Taiwan a few rounds already, should we strike or not?” “Not necessarily.” But then someone else would come out and say, ‘Hey, I am going to strike!” So, that’s called “strategic ambiguity”.

现在因为主要基于上海公报，上海公报已经扯淡了，是吧？共产党现在是种族大屠杀、反人类罪，这又加了一个合法的机构。那你说这帮王八蛋要去台湾威胁，你该不该打呢？“哎？该打！因为它是犯罪分子，反人类罪大屠杀，那到台湾会不会种族大屠杀哪？那可能性就加强啦，所以说，得打。”

Now it’s all based upon “the Shanghai Communique”, but that communique has become nonsense, right? But now the CCP committing genocide and crimes against humanity has been recognized by legal organizations, so will you strike if these bastards come to threaten Taiwan? “Eh? Of course we should! Because it is packed with criminals who have committed crimes against humanity such as genocide and mass-killing. Then will it commit genocide and mass-killing in Taiwan? The possibility has gone up, so, we should strike.”

最后的决定，大家你们会看到，美国和西方马上就会发生。明确对台湾的战略性的所有的军事决定，就是，你只要军机到哪儿，多少度，多少维度，你突破什么什么什么防线，你要[向]台湾军队开枪了，你主动开枪了，或者台湾人被杀啦，或者你围岛啦，或者是你造成实质性的威胁了，自动开打。

Everyone will see that the US and the West will come up with their final decision soon, to clarify all the strategic, military decisions regarding Taiwan. And that is to say, if your [CCP’s] aircrafts fly cross a certain multitude and latitude, or some lines of defense, or if you open fire to the Taiwan military proactively, or some Taiwanese was killed [because of you], or you surround the island, or you are deemed as having constituted substantive threats to Taiwan, the war will then start automatically.

把“战略模糊”期彻底结束，到“战略清晰”期，明确红线和原则。这和当年什么时候一样？辛丑年、庚子年，120年前一模一样！庚子赔款，辛丑合约。大家看着吧！所以说现在到了个最关键的时期。

Putting a complete end to “strategic ambiguity”, and entering an era of “clear strategies” with clear “red line” and principles – when did this happen in history? Also in the Chinese Xinchou and Gengzi years – everything was the same as 120 years before, when there were the Boxer Indemnity and the Boxer Protocol. Let’s see! So now it has come to a critical time.

你看台湾的股票，台湾的科技股票，特别像台积电这种，你看过一段儿会有啥变化？你看看西方沼泽地里边，在台湾的这些事情[上]他会有啥变化？

Look at the Taiwan stock market, the technology stocks, especially Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) and the alike. You will see what changes will happen after a period of time. You will see how the western swamp’s attitude towards the Taiwan matter will change.

这一次，昨天我重申一下，不是达拉斯，是阿拉斯加。七哥这个嘴啊，阿拉斯加，阿拉斯加，阿拉斯加那个机场，叫什么什么雷齐啊。我飞来飞去这么多年，几十年我从来不记，就那个鸟地方。

Let me correct what I said yesterday: it was in Alaska, not Dallas. What has Brother Seven’s mouth done? It’s Alaska, Alaska, Alaska! That airport in Alaska is called something like “…rage” (referring to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport). I have been flying in and out that airport for many years, for decades, but I can never remember its name. Yeah, that remote place.

这个见面，基本上这是战争前的第一次通告。老共一定还会玩儿花招，你会看到，突然，中美之间又“积极”啦，然后“非敌非友”啦。一定会有的！然后第二次，还得有通告，估计不在阿拉斯加，也会在其他差不多的地方。然后第三次，你就会看不到啦，就会开战啦，这是基本上可预期[的]。

This meeting basically is the first open announcement before a war. The CCP is definitely going to play some tricks. You will see that, all of a sudden, the Sino-US relationship will take a turn to the positive side, and then will become neither a favorable nor a non-favorable relationship, definitely. Then there will be a second meeting with something announced, not in Alaska probably, but at somewhere similar. And then there won’t be a third meeting because the war will break out. These are basically things expected to happen.

在这三次之前，最有可能的是，如果老共主动干台湾，共匪主动干台湾，那就没有第一、第二了，那就任何情况下都开战了。

Before these three rounds are completed, the most likely thing to happen is that, if the CCP bandits attacks Taiwan proactively, then there won’t be the first or second round, because the war will break out at any time.

此时此刻，据说中方带来大礼，正在谈呢。带来了大礼，听说这盘儿肉，是让美国是要流口水的。对香港和台湾，包括新疆这个种族大屠杀、反人类罪，是都会放下的。就是彻底能把你“蓝金黄”了的。觉得能成吗？兄弟姐妹们？看看吧。

At this very moment, it’s said that the Chinese are bringing a huge gift to the negotiation. I’ve heard that “the big dish of steak” being brought to the table is so big that it will make the US drool, and the latter might drop all the accusation about its crimes in Hong Kong, Taiwan, including the genocide and mass-killing in Xinjiang and its crimes against humanity. They plan to completely BGY you America. Can the CCP achieve its goals, brothers and sisters? Just wait and see.

现在最关键的，这也是我们今年说的，“以毒灭共”是全世界谁也绕不过去的一座大山。现在对毒，[对]共产党的病毒真相的调查和溯源的要求，和让共产党承担责任的要求，已经绝对跨越两党，是美国[民主]共和两党的绝对共同认识，是唯一一个大家共同能谈的话题，不吵架不骂架的。美国这个国家，两党已经完全互相不认识，互相不了解，互相不想去了解，互相不能合作的，这是这些年灾难[发生]的根本[原因]。但就在这一件事上，现在双方可以谈，可以合作，互相还尊重。共产党的病毒杀了几十万美国人。现在把两党给团结起来了，唯一的[原因]，共产党病毒。

The most critical thing is what we have been saying this year: “taking down the CCP by spreading the truth about the virus” is like a big mountain – something no one in this world can get around. Now the demand to investigate the truth about the CCP virus and find out the origin of the CCP virus, and hold the CCP accountable has reached an absolute bipartisan agreement. It is now an absolute common ground by the Republicans and Democrats and the only topic they can talk about without fighting or arguing. In the US, the two parties have become total strangers to each other, and don’t want to understand and cooperate with each other. This is the fundamental reason for the disasters in all these years. But on this very matter, they can now sit down and negotiate, cooperate with each other, and what’s more, they can respect each other. The CCP virus has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, and now this has united the two parties, for the sole reason – the CCP virus.

在欧洲，欧盟最大的问题，就是所谓的欧盟预算，还有欧盟的各国的权力。也就是“分脏”的问题。从来也是，越来越夸张的是，在欧元问题上，在交税的问题上，在军事开支的分销问题上，大家争来争去。但是唯一在病毒[问题]上，现在达成了一致意见，相互合作，没争议。另外一个就是英国、日本，这两个独立的有特色的国家，在[之前]对中共啥都怕，一切都拿钱[可以]解决。现在唯一在这个病毒的问题上，谁也不敢谈，别谈。据说共产党开出了相当大的条件，都是拿着最好的5V的牛肉，拿着鱼腩（鱼肚子），金枪鱼肚子就上去了。当然有蓝金黄啦，是吧？据说不吃这一套。

In Europe, the biggest problem is the so-called EU budget, and the separation of powers among the EU Members, namely the “how to divide the loot” problem. It has always been like this and has become even worse with endless arguing on the issues of Euro, taxation, and cost sharing of military expenses. But only on the virus have they reached agreement, and started to cooperate without questions. Next are the UK and Japan. These two independent and distinctive countries used to be scared of the CCP on everything and resolve everything using money, but now on the very issue of the virus, they are so firm that no one dare to negotiate with them, no room is left for negotiation. It’s said that the CCP has given quite attractive offers, such as top quality beef, fish belly meat, Chutoro. Of course, there’s the BGY, right? It’s said that these are not working.

共产党病毒将彻底改变世界，彻底结束中共，彻底拯救中国人，除了中国人自己作之外。你不知道这个意义，你还往上冲，那没办法。兄弟姐妹们，走着看。谢谢！还是那句话，莘县阳谷县搭县，走走看。

The CCP virus will completely change the world and end the CCP itself, which will completely save the Chinese people, excluding those who ask troubles for themselves, and don’t know the meaning [of the virus] and still go forward [with the CCP]. Those people are not savable. Let’s just wait and see, brothers and sisters. Thanks a lot! As always, Shen and Yanggu are two adjacent counties competing with each other, so let’s wait and see who will win!
