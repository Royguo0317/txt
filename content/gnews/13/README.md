**A Journey of Disillusionment**

Author: Jenny Summerfield

In 2013, I first journeyed to China. My friend, Nancy, and I spent six months researching and planning mostly to see the scenery in western China. Nancy, who had traveled to China many times, warned me: the culture shock that she had experienced in China was greater than that when she first arrived in the United States from Taiwan decades ago. I wondered how bad it could be; after all, China’s economy had made significant progress. Little did I know that what awaited me, beyond the amazing nature, was more than my ability to speak Mandarin and read Chinese could comprehend.

I believe most Americans who have visited China might not see what I saw which was merely the tip of the iceberg. My journey of disillusionment went on for years and I’m glad that I’ve seen the truth—the ugly truth. Let’s start from the beginning.

**The Collision**

I was waiting on the sidewalk near the guest house, ready to take a nap after strolling in the Kirti Monastery. That morning we had taken a long bus ride to Langmusi, a village with a population of less than 5,000 in the Tibetan Plateau. Child, adolescent, and adult monks in burgundy lama robes were everywhere. Under the clear blue sky which was rare in most heavily air-polluted cities in China, the late July afternoon air was crisp and cool.

Along the grooved road, John, sixty-seven years of age with a slight potbelly, walked slowly toward the guest house, an expensive camera swaying in front of his chest. From behind came a small white sedan. Without honking as a typical Chinese driver would do, the driver paused the car, let it slide, and hit John, who then stumbled, almost falling to the ground. Protecting the camera, John managed to stand up, turned around, and hit the car with his fist.

A heavily built middle-aged lama jumped out of the car. Pushing John, he yelled, “Why did you hit my car?”

Pushing back his five inches taller opponent, John shouted, “Because your car hit me!”

The monk grabbed John’s polo shirt with one hand, his index finger of the other pointed to some direction behind him. “You should have yielded to my car as the other guy did!”

“I didn’t even know you were behind me!” John grabbed lama’s robe and roared, his veins bulging on his temple.

Suddenly the monk let go of John’s shirt and started pulling his camera; John’s hands instantly moved over to protect it. While they were fighting for it, out of the blue, Nancy jumped in, pushing her arms against both men and screamed, “Alright, alright, it’s our fault. We apologize.” John got the hint and quickly said, “Okay, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”

“I told you! You should have yielded to my car!” The monk let go of the camera, got in his car, and took off with another monk who had been sitting in the passenger’s seat for the entire time.

Standing alone thirty feet away, I was aghast by the accident, feeling a bit shameful for being unable to help as Nancy did. It was surreal; the innocent sky with fluffy clouds seemed to observe the human dramas. Later, Nancy revealed the reason she had apologized to the monk: all the locals near her, including our super-friendly and enthusiastic lodging owners, said it was John’s fault because he didn’t yield to the car. We were dismayed by their comments—how about human rights—but we were in a foreign country.

In retrospect, what stunned me was not a traffic collision, but a collision of beliefs. Nancy, John, and I had met in a Tibetan temple more than a decade ago in the United States and practiced Buddhism for some years. Isn’t Buddhism about compassion and being a good person? Why a monk would want to hit a human being? The monk had probably grown up in the monastery for the majority of his life. What was different from what he had learned and what I had learned?

**What’s Food Got to Do with It?**

The next morning in Langmusi we went to a small family-owned eatery for breakfast. At around seven the place was empty with two tables and no ambiance. There were only a handful of selections; we ordered everything on the menu. Right after we placed our order, another group of four Chinese tourists came in and they quickly ordered their food.

The village pace was relaxing and slow. We waited for a long time before the waitress showed up again. Walking towards our table, she carried a plate of steamed buns. “Steamed buns? Here, here!” A guy at the other table cried out, waving his hand towards the waitress. The waitress stopped, turned, and gave the steamed buns to that table. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Our food just got hijacked! The waitress obeyed the person who made noises.

Before visiting China, I witnessed a Chinese woman yelling at a waitress in Hong Kong and despised that rude customer. What a barbarian in a civilized international city! After being in China, I realized it was common that people spoke to the restaurant staff at full volume. Some customers even scolded the staff so badly that the entire restaurant echoed with the piercing noise. And the restaurant staff always remained silent. What a terrible occupation!

On the other hand, upon arriving in China, I immediately learned that waiting in line almost did not exist. Some people even cut in the line for the customs check at the airport. When ordering food at a window in a Chinese eatery where no line was formed, I had to shout out my order. Otherwise, I would be waiting there forever. But I had never seen my food disappear right in front of me.

A couple of months later in Qingdao, a harbor on the east coast, I was waiting for my order. This famous stuffed pie take-out place was located in a basement. The order window was less than a foot above the ground and a small stainless steel counter extended from the windowsill to the sidewalk. My mother, my brother, and I ordered three different pies. The lady put my pie in a plastic bag on the counter saying, “Eggplant,” and then disappeared. Continuously looking down at the order window, suddenly I heard a low male voice “Is this eggplant?” A hand put down one RMB (roughly 6.5 RMB = 1 dollar) on the counter and took my pie.

In one second my pie disappeared! Flabbergasted, I turned around and saw a young man biting into my pie and rejoining his friends. Still in shock, I turned back to the window and the lady had reappeared with a grin, “I’ll give you another one.” She couldn’t stop smiling. This time I picked up each bag promptly because your food would not be yours unless it was in your hands.

Another food hijacking—I blamed myself for losing my guard and combat skills that I had acquired since the trip to western China. I had checked my surroundings before placing the order: clear, nobody near the window. That group of young people was fifteen feet away, talking and eating their pies. But how could he take my food without even asking? Did I stand there for no reason?

In Beijing, I experienced another strange situation at a cafeteria established in the 1970s, which remained the state-owned setup and atmosphere per online reviews. Born and growing up in Taiwan, I was able to enjoy various Chinese cuisines from different provinces because many Chinese fled to Taiwan before the Communists took over China in 1949. The exception was Beijing street food; I read a lot about them and had wanted to taste them for decades. With high anticipation, I decided to have a traditional breakfast in this place.

The cafeteria was large and bare bone. Along the back wall was a counter displaying many options. It was an off-peak hour, a staff member taking a nap at one of the long dining tables. No one was behind me, so I had time to take in and select the food from my childhood memory. I ordered the fermented mung bean juice along with skinny fried savory dough rings and pickled vegetables. While the middle-aged lady opened the big pot of steamy grayish juice, a loud male voice suddenly arose behind me. “What is that? Some kind of soup?”

Filling up my bowl, she said sternly, louder than the man, “You don’t know how to eat it! You can’t have it!” She closed the lid.

Do I know how to eat it? I wondered—I just followed some online suggestions. That man didn’t speak Mandarin like locals with a strong curling tongue, neither did I. Why did she sell it to me, not him? What kind of customer service was this? Had it been like this since the 1970s—a server in a state-owned cafeteria got to decide who could eat what? When having the juice, I kept stealing a glance at her, checking to see whether she would be examining me. I almost finished the juice, but to be honest, Beijing street food was not my cup of tea. At least I was allowed to try it, though.

**Doublethink?**

Into the west we hired a middle-aged tour guide/driver and a minivan for five days; we always chatted when he was not on the phone while driving. On the second day, someone brought up the topic of the September 11 attacks.

“We were all celebrating,” the guide said excitedly. “We all applauded the great hero Osama bin Laden because he successfully attacked the Capitalist Empire of the United States!”

Shivers went down my spine; silence filled the car. Someone quickly changed the subject. Since he was Muslim, I thought it was the Muslim celebrating the attack.

The day before we parted, the guide asked us whether we could help him and his family go to the United States and get them green cards. I was dumbfounded. “Why do you want to go to America?” someone asked.

“It’s better there,” said the guide. Then why did you celebrate the September 11 attack? I felt like asking.

“But it’s beautiful here, the mountains, the prairies.” Nancy said, “Where do you want to see in the US?”

“I absolutely want to see New York City.” Someone asked why—probably as shocked as I was. Did he want to see the destroyed site? He said, “It’s the greatest city in the world, bustling and exciting, with tall buildings, many things to see, many rich people.”

“But it’s very crowded and congested there. Look, it’s so beautiful here,” said Nancy, still amazed by nature. “You’ll have a better life here.”

Despite his continuous saying that New York City was the only city he had to see before he died, we all chimed in, lightly explaining why we were unable to help. The bottom line was I didn’t want to support potential suicide bombers. Don’t get me wrong—we all liked him for he was a nice and direct person. For instance, once I asked him the name of the trees which lined the road. “They are elm trees,” he said and continued, “We used to eat their bark when we had nothing to eat.” He didn’t need to volunteer any information about the famine—not glory to share with foreigners.

Then what was going on with him? For a person who cared for us, telling us all the do’s and don’ts—to avoid scams and the police. A person was so sincere—he even treated us to a meal at his home, and yet seemingly cold-blooded. How could a person admire a city so much but also celebrate the biggest tragedy in its history? It doesn’t make any sense!

Ever since then I avoided telling people where I came from unless they asked. And the answer I gave was Taiwan. Even though most people responded with envy, I wasn’t sure it was good or bad.

**Powerful Propaganda**

In China, I once watched the one-and-only national news on TV—the daily brainwashing. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) listed notes and announcements in white on a few cobalt blue screens, while the reporter read each item in a dictating manner. The great firewall prohibited people from accessing any news and information with different views from the CCP. It still does. I had no access to YouTube and my emails, and no western social media either. Some Chinese people use Virtual Private Networks, a.k.a. the ladders, to climb the firewall to access the information from the rest of the world.

The brainwashing existed wherever I went. In every city, town, village, and the middle of nowhere, there were many propaganda signs, such as demanding that people be productive. On mountains, massive messages read: “Long live the Communist Party to ten thousand years,” “Long live Chairman Mao to ten thousand years old”—oh well, saying something doesn’t make it so.

My favorite was “The Communist Party is good; every citizen is happy.” Shouldn’t the performance of a political party be determined by an election? Since there was no election in China, the one-and-only political party could say whatever they wanted. However, happiness can be very subjective and inconsistent over time—depending on when one takes the survey. How can a political party be one hundred percent sure that every single citizen is happy? It was obvious propaganda and brainwashing.

I wanted to verify the true life of the people behind the skyscrapers, fancy neon lights lit the harbors and high-speed rails. Then I had a peep through peeing.

**Real Life behind Propaganda**

Halfway between the breathtaking Jiuzhaigou National Park and Chengdu in southwest China, the minibus stopped in front of a few stores in the middle of nowhere. It might not be a regular bus stop because a recent earthquake had destroyed the major roads for buses. It had been over two hours; everyone headed toward the public restroom. In my wildest dream I wouldn’t imagine such a scene in a ladies’ room: a line of women in a squat position, back to the entrance, heads down. There wasn’t a single door and the concrete dividers between the stalls were about two feet high.

I wanted to back out, but my bladder disagreed. Therefore, I stepped up into the short “stable,” glancing at the heads and shoulders of the women in front of me, squatted over a concrete ditch running through the entire length of the room, and took care of my own business, meanwhile trying to ignore the woman standing and waiting next to me. I felt like asking her to back off, but what was the point? Given the circumstance, I couldn’t take any action if she didn’t comply, could I? Does each person keep her back to the entrance to preserve her meager dignity? I wondered.

That public restroom was the quietest one I’d ever been to with no flushing, no opening and closing the doors, no talking, no washing and drying hands, no toilet paper rolling—no toilet paper provided. The only sound was from peeing and footsteps. Before I finished, a roar of the water swept through the ditch. Walking out of the restroom, I was upset. In there, what was the difference between a human being and an animal? Zero. What kind of government would treat their citizens like that? Oddly, there were no graffiti or anti-government statements on the concrete walls; no one dared do so if privacy was stripped away. To me, it was one form of daily brainwashing: it’s fine to live like an animal.

You may argue I was spoiled by the modern toilet. When I was little, I had no problem using my grandma’s old toilet without plumbing because it had a door. In multiple-day backpacking or long hikes, I took care of business in nature many times. It was fine because nature did not humiliate me. In the late ’80s, Taiwanese were first allowed to travel to mainland China; ladies came back spreading the tale of the horrible restrooms with no doors. Their open umbrellas had become their temporary doors. With all the economic development that China had achieved, I thought all restrooms would be like those in the popular tourist locations.

To me, that restroom was just the tip of the iceberg; the same abusive concept must have crept into their way of life on a large scale. On the other hand, if generations had been living in a nation of brainwashing, how long would it take to deprogram it from the DNA? How many city dwellers, now living with modern lavatories, were still oblivious to being treated like animals?

In Beijing, the cleaning lady of Nancy’s son told me her story. Like many non-registered, a.k.a. “underground” people, her family of three couldn’t afford the government’s high migration registration fees to relocate to Beijing. Not only they had no freedom to move, but also her five-year-old daughter wouldn’t be allowed to attend public schools because they were not allowed to live in Beijing legally. Near the fifth circle area, in a concrete industrial facility, which was shared by more than a dozen families, they lived in a twelve by twelve square foot room, paying the higher industrial electric rate, with no windows or air conditioning. Her daughter often complained that the room was too hot in the summer. Her family conducted their whole lives in that room.

Outside their building, they shared a ditch-type public restroom with residents from nearby buildings. And someone manually flushed and cleaned the restroom once a day—no individual flush. “Sometimes people couldn’t make it to the toilet in the morning, so there were droppings on the floor for the entire day,” she said with a disgusting look. There was no shower room in her building or the public restroom. “Taking a shower is unimportant,” she said.

They came to Beijing because the village-owned farmland couldn’t support the family. She had two cleaning jobs and her husband had a full-time job. Her income from one cleaning job paid for their housing. They saved money and bought a used car which her husband used as a non-licensed taxi for extra income. Every time they visited their village during the holidays, she didn’t feel like coming back. “It’s so open and beautiful in the countryside, but we have no choice,” she said. She too asked me how they could immigrate to the United States.

**The Corruption**

The danger of totalitarianism is that a totalitarian regime can do whatever it wants without any consequences. Nancy’s son worked for a new company in Beijing. The company, located in a fancy high-rise office building, couldn’t open for business because their unit didn’t have water and electricity. Weeks later, they realized they had to bribe the people in charge. However, who knew how many people up the vine wanted a cut? So they paid a public relations specialist forty grand RMB (roughly $6,000) to take care of it, in one day.

In Lanzhou, the capital city of northwest China’s Gansu province, I asked a taxi driver about the unnecessary standalone white metal grill dividers on the major roads in the city. She said, “The city replaces them every other year, so everyone in the government involved in that project receives a kickback. They make their money by never-ending projects.” She emphasized that kickbacks were common in the entire nation, including the military. When some of them got caught—due to supporting the wrong political leader, hundreds of gold bars could be found at their homes and military trucks carted away cash. I thought if all officials took one less gold bar, all public restrooms in China could be modernized with a proper door—if no one skinned off from the projects.

By the time we returned to Beijing from western China, I decided not to visit China again. I met many hard-working and friendly people but the latent hostility towards America and lack of social order, morality, and respect to people unsettled me. It was sad that my father’s homeland turned out to be a disappointment. After coming back from China, I couldn’t tell anyone about my vacation with excitement. People’s responses to the food hijackings stopped me from scaring them further. I tried to bury the trip deep in my memory, but a question kept popping up: Why did my tour guide and the monk behave like that?

**The Beginning of My Disillusionment**

Several months after my trip, I recalled some people in my old temple who memorized the Buddhist teachings so well that many believed they must have implemented the teachings daily. However, they were proven to be hypocrites. Knowledge is always just knowledge if one does not practice or implement it. So, why did I expect a monk to behave better than laypeople? I realized my perspective had fooled me. Under a lama robe, the monk was merely human, but I supposed him to behave like a holy man.

Did I make the same mistake about China?

As the US-China trade war became popular in the media, I researched more about China. I realized how easily I could be fooled by lama robes as well as the glorious economic numbers of a nation. My mind has quietly and sadly surrendered to mainstream media—China’s rising power and superpower—and China’s propaganda. My perspective had fooled me again.

Based on my reading about CCP, professor R.J. Rummel estimated that almost 21 million people were killed by Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, and 15.6 million Russian were killed by Stalin from 1945 to 1953. The authoritative “Black Book of Communism” estimated 65 million Chinese died under Mao’s regime. Mao killed a lot more people than Hitler and Stalin combined.

Nowadays, the CCP had taken off Mao’s uniforms and put on suits and ties like the West, but their ambition of taking down America and then ruling the world remains the same. Under the mask of the second-biggest economy, the CCP has skillfully brainwashed the West with ‘President’ Xi instead of ‘general secretary’ of the CCP to better blend into the western political system and cover up the truth that there is no election in China.

On YouTube, I found Miles Guo, an exiled Chinese billionaire whose goal is to take down the CCP. What he revealed about the CCP stunned me more than what I had experienced in China. I couldn’t believe that any government wouldn’t put their people’s welfare as the top priority and that the CCP has a licentious lifestyle and tells lies all the time. I was one of the people—Miles claimed—whose moral standard was way too high compared to the CCP’s. I fully understood that some people didn’t trust Miles because what he said was way beyond their imagination. It took me months to fully comprehend the statements made by Miles and his supporters, such as Lude and Lao Jiang. The bloody truth often made me shiver, sometimes gave me nightmares.

On September 11, 2019, Lude and Lao Jiang mentioned on their daily political talk show that all of China had celebrated the September 11 attacks. And China’s national media steered the celebration. For years, I had trouble understanding my tour guide’s hatred and love of America, but he turned out to be a typical brainwashed and manipulated Chinese by the CCP. Lude’s addressing many brainwashed Chinese as Doublethink or schizophrenia relieved me—I was not crazy. The endless daily hatred towards many nations in the world kept the Chinese people so busy around the clock that they couldn’t pay attention to their malfunctioned and evil government.

Meanwhile, an anti-CCP middle-aged YouTuber Shi Tao, who had grown up in Beijing, recalled a movie in history class about the development of the human species. “The movie showed several cavemen coming out of a cave. Then a male grabbed a female and started having sex,” he said. My jaw dropped, and he continued, “This is how the CCP educates their people: a human is merely a piece of meat!”

Now it explained another story that the female taxi driver in Lanzhou had told us. We were on a busy road. She pointed at a multi-storied hotel/restaurant and said, “Last week, a local Communist leader had a party there and one hundred eighty girls from the university went to let him choose and take whoever he wanted to bed.” She loathed, “The madness went on all night.” I once thought that story was just a rare case, but now understand it’s a common practice of CCP’s licentious lifestyle.

In terms of women’s rights, another video on the internet blew my mind: a line of women, wearing only underwear and shoes, waiting for a job interview; a fully dressed man was monitoring the situation. Per Miles Guo, Hainan Airlines started a naked body physical exam for selecting stewardesses in China. What is the difference between those exams/interviews and a livestock auction? How many Chinese women must use their bodies to get a better life?

Then I watched an award-winning documentary film *Harvested Alive: 10 Years of Investigations* at harvestedalive.com revealed a state-sanctioned human organs harvest in China from live prisoners in concentration camps or prisons. The organ harvests and transplants were mainly done in the military hospitals; sometimes bodies were burned in the boiler rooms.

A free downloadable report, “Bloody Harvest/The Slaughter: An Update,” by David Kilgour, Ethan Gutmann, and David Matas, detailed the state crime of slaughter, with even more brutal information, including *Bodies: The Exhibition*. It was toured in the United States in 2005 with 22 skinless corpses and 260 real human organ specimens that had tissue fluid extracted and silicone pumped into them. I don’t know how millions of visitors felt in the exhibition, but I felt gross by just looking at two photos of the specimens: one man and one pregnant woman (see photos from the report).
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gnews-media-offload/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/17152322/yellow1.png)
The man stood tall, hanging his full-body skin high in his arm like a coat. That the specimen seemed to proudly display himself skinless only showed how inhumane and arrogant the makers were. To me, it was not an art but cruelty and evilness.
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gnews-media-offload/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/17152509/yellow2.png)
As for the pregnant woman, who also proudly displayed her open belly with the unborn baby to the public, the report said, “According to Chinese law, pregnant women cannot be sentenced to capital punishment. Who would donate the remains of his unfortunate wife and unborn child to a paid exhibition? Where did these human specimens come from? How did they become exhibits?” It turned out that the corpses used in the body exhibits had been provided by the police and plastinated within two days of death.

At the time I was bombarded by CCP’s evil conducts so much that ‘overwhelmed’ did not scratch the surface. It was sad to witnesse my father’s homeland now disgraced by the CCP. Good Chinese traditional values and culture that my father taught me were destroyed. Nevertheless, I felt lucky for living in the United States, thinking I was far away from the devils. Needless to say, my wishful thinking was wrong.

**The Aftermath Hit Home**

As of today, the West and the rest of the world have gone on a strenuous journey to see the truth about CCP while many still chose to look the other way. During the U.S.-China trade war, Wall Street, American corporations, and pro-China media pressured President Trump to make a deal with the CCP. When the brave Hong Kong protesters fought for their freedom, we witnessed some NBA players and many American companies sold their souls for the money that the CCP thugs had promised them.

For several months now, many places around the globe have been locked down and people have struggled to survive during the CCP virus pandemic. The United States has been hit especially hard, but Black Lives Matter demonstrations happened to thrive just about the time when the Americans tried to get back on their feet.

In the beginning, BLM seemed to arise with a good cause. However, when riot, arson, bloodshed, and destroying historical landmarks became nightly occurrences, Miles Guo and his supporters called out the Cultural Revolution 2.0 manipulated by international communist organizations. To them, what has been happening in America is no difference to the Chinese Cultural Revolution in the ’60s. The CCP had burned books, taken down statues, and canceled the Chinese culture, values, customs, and religions during the ten-year cultural revolution and replaced them with the one-and-only communist ideology. Then the two BLM leaders admitted that they were trained by the Marxists. So their purpose became obvious: to overturn the government and make it a communist state.

On the other hand, a YouTube video also revealed that the Chinese were involved in the White House riots. In the background of fire, a man kept urging people in Mandarin, “Leave quickly, leave quickly!” The next day on the Chinese social media WeChat, that group of rioters complained about their careless act becoming viral on YouTube and mentioned that the Chinese military attaché had been on the scene. During a Fox News interview, Gordon Chang stated, “the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Communist Party’s global ties have been engaged in a malicious disinformation campaign, deliberately stoking racial tensions in the U.S. And U.S. Customs has seized items coming from China this year that would be very handy for protesters.”

Miles Guo pointed out long ago that for decades the Americans had funneled the money to the CCP who then used it to weaken, unsettle, and destroy America. The CCP has fully taken advantage of an open society, and infiltrated into the United States like a poison ivy creeping up a big oak tree. Our schools taught Marxism; the CCP’s Confucius Institutes, which have nothing to do with promoting the condemned Confucious’s teachings, encroached on our academic freedom. Some mainstream media adopted CCP’s misinformation to attack President Trump as if taking down Trump were more important than taking down the CCP—the source of the catastrophe. Did they lose their mind?

As the West has been slowly awakening to this Neo-Marxism movement, WHO and many elites, including scientists, researchers, Bill Gates, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, politicians, still ignored the truth and chose to become CCP’s running dogs. The brave Dr. Li-Meng Yan from Hong Kong risked her life to tell the world about the truth of the CCP virus, the safety, and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), but the mainstream media didn’t report them. Furthermore, Twitter suspended her account with almost 60,000 followers in less than 48 hours after she had opened it and less than six hours after she had posted a link to her first report. That scientific report suggesting laboratory modification and detailed the possible route that how the CCP virus was manufactured in the lab. What were they afraid of?

While the CCP leaders had been taking HCQ from the beginning so none of them were infected, per Dr. Yan, some of our governors and FDA banned HCQ. And social media dare ban the videos of supporting hydroxychloroquine by American medical doctors and researchers. Where is freedom of speech? When do social media and politicians know better than professional doctors about practicing medicine? They censor opinions unaligned with their narratives or—maybe more accurately—CCP’s narratives. The CCP leaders want as many Americans to die as possible without taking HCQ as a prophylactic or an effective and safe early treatment. And yet some of our politicians, Dr. Fauci, FDA, and the media, for some reason, have chosen to stand by the killer.

As a Miles Guo’s supporter, I’ve learned to interpret CCP’s statements oppositely. Per An Hong, Lude’s co-host, a former editor-in-chief at People’s Daily, the #1 media in China, said that the only thing believable on People’s Daily was the publication date. Not only did the CCP never deliver their promise that they would give the Chinese people the American-style democracy, but they also didn’t implement any international agreements. While their media were subject to China’s strict propaganda rule, many American media heavily cited their pandemic numbers and propaganda narratives. How idiotic can our media be? If they did it on purpose, then they were as guilty as the CCP.

The world is in a lunatic state. As I read American daily news, I wonder where it is safe to live in the future. Back in 1949, my father fled China because his mother was killed by the CCP, so I definitely didn’t come to America for another communist country. I came for the land of free and equal opportunity and the home of the brave who stand for democracy and law and order. As a proud American, I would hate to see my country being taken over by communists or Marxists because the entire world will fall into hell.

Thus, I pray for my fellow Americans to disillusion and fight against the Marxist/communist devils. This is our last chance. I pledge you to answer this question: would you like to see your children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren live in a socialist/communist country like China or Venezuela? If you don’t, it’s time to take down the CCP who has brought us the plague and killed tens of thousands of people. And vote for the presidential candidate who will bring generations to come to the way of living you wish.

God bless America and the Chinese people.
