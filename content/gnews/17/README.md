**摘要：在2021年6月10日的盖特视频中，郭先生评论FBI局长克里斯托弗·雷（Christopher Wray）在国会的质询，并相信FBI和国土安全部门在闫博士的营救过程中的种种阻挠行为终将有曝光的一天。同时他曝光闫博士的先生 [Ranawaka A P M Perera](https://repository.hku.hk/cris/rp/rp02500)，已持工作签证来美国，不禁让人质疑这个在中共制造冠状病毒生物武器过程中起到重要作用的人员是如何来美国如入无人之境的，FBI和美国国土安全部门在中间起到了什么作用。**

#### **FBI对闫博士的营救和曝光病毒横加阻挠！闫博士先生来美意欲何为？**
**What Did FBI Do During Dr. Yan’s Rescue? What Is the Purpose of the Visit of Dr. Yan’s Husband?**

兄弟姐妹们，今天又是个大日子。一个小时后在美国的国会山有这个议员发动的对FBI的现在的这个Wray，就是这个FBI局长雷（Christopher Asher Wray）发起的询问当中，最重要的就是关于科学家闫丽梦女士，这个我们的英雄。当年爆料革命救她出来[的时候]如何来到纽约？[如何]在洛杉矶被国土安全部威胁、搜身，差点死在机场，然后又到达了纽约，被洛杉矶国的土安全部的人追到纽约，和FBI的人砸她的门。后来在大使馆和我们找的律师，也是FBI的律师，和班农先生面谈4天，班农先生[当时]睡在地板上。

Brothers and sisters, today is another big day. In an hour, on Capitol Hill, some senators are going to have a hearing with Christopher Asher Wray, the current director of the FBI. The most important part of the hearing will be about our heroine scientist, Dr. Li-Meng Yan. The Whistleblower Movement helped her escape Hong Kong last year. How did she get to New York? Why was she threatened and searched by the Department Homeland Security (DHS) agents in Los Angeles to the point where she almost died at the airport? Afterwards, she arrived in New York and was still being tracked by DHS agents and FBI agents from Los Angeles. These individuals pounded on the door of her apartment. Later, at the Himalaya Embassy, the FBI attorney we hired met with Mr. Bannon for four days, during which time, Mr. Bannon slept on the floor.

FBI说要两年调查这个刑事案子，最后我们自己采取了独立行动，直接上媒体。

The FBI agents said it would take two years to investigate this criminal case. Finally, we took independent action ourselves and exposed it directly through the media.

背后的故事太多了。包括闫丽梦博士写的报告给FBI，听说这个报告并没有给川普总统，也没交给白宫，更没交给司法部，也没交给国会。如果交的话，美国不至于死那么多人，世界也不至于死那么多人，是吧？

There were so many stories behind the scenes. Rumor says that the report Dr. Yan had handed to the FBI was not presented to President Trump, nor the White House, nor the DOJ, nor Congress.

If her report had been handed over, there wouldn’t have been so many casualties [due to the virus] in the US and in the world. Right?

后来大家知道，去年，2020年刚开始的时候，闫博士的先生也来到了美国。FBI、国土安全部没采取任何措施。爆料当中明确说她先生是重要的专家和参与者，[她先生是]感染病学家。今年[他先生]又拿着工作签证来到了美国，据说跟FBI和国土安全部有合作。

Later we got to know that Dr. Yan’s husband came to the US in early 2020 too. The FBI and DHS did not do anything about his arrival, even though we said explicitly via our Whistleblower Movement that her husband was a key expert and participant [of the making of the virus], and an immunologist. This year her husband was granted a work visa to come to the US again. It’s said that he came to cooperate with the FBI and the DHS.

合作是干啥呢？不是说科学家多牛，[而是说]科学家没有资格讲病毒，[说]科学家说的都是假话，可能郭文贵和班农设计了个骗局 ——大家都懂的。

What were they cooperating on? Her husband did not come to the US to prove how good our scientist is, but rather to smear her and claim that she is unqualified to talk about the virus and to testify that what Dr. Yan said was false, and that it could be a hoax designed by Miles Guo and Bannon – you all should understand what this means.

闫科学家的先生，当时从科学家到现在，他到哪儿去了？他去过深圳吗？去过北京吗？去过武汉吗？去过山西吗？是不是啊？他回过斯里兰卡都见谁了？到迪拜都见谁了？是吧？[去]这些国家都见谁了？全世界都 quarantine 的时候，去那些地方干啥去呀，是不是？去UAE干什么去啦？这些事情都会出来的，战友们不用着急。

Where has Dr. Yan’s husband been? Has he been to Shenzhen? Has he been to Beijing? Has he been to Wuhan? Has he been to Shanxi? Who did he go back to Sri Lanka to meet? Whom did he meet in Dubai? Whom did he see in these countries? What did he do in those places when the whole world was in a quarantine mode? Right? What did he go to the UAE for? All these things will be uncovered sooner or later. Fellow fighters, you don’t need to rush.

在美国这个国家，永远两件事你不要失去信心，两件事不要失去耐心。第一个，对美国国家的法制不要失去信心，这个国家是有法制的；对美国的国会议员，有几个三瓜两枣的不是好东西，但不要对[整体]国会议员和国会失去信心。[关于]耐心，在美国你想等到法律的公平审判必须要有耐心，不管什么结果都要有耐心，等事实搞清楚，或者对一个事情的结果要有耐心。

In the US, never lose your faith or patience in two things. Firstly, do not lose confidence in the legal system of the US. There is rule of law in this country. It is true that there are a few bad people in the US Congress, but don’t lose confidence in all members of Congress and the Congress. Regarding patience, firstly, if you want to wait for a fair trial under the law in the US, you have to be patient. Be patient with whatever outcome you are waiting for, wait for the facts to get straightened out, or be patient with the outcome of a matter.

你[们]咋不调查闫丽梦女士给美国的爆料呢？FBI[也是]一样的，是吧？

Why didn’t you study what Dr. Li-Meng Yan has revealed to the US? Same question to the FBI, right?

闫丽梦女士的对美国人在爆料，拯救美国人的信息，爆料革命一而再、再而三向美国传达的信息[你们怎么不调查]？

Why didn’t you investigate the information Dr. Li-Meng Yan revealed to the US? Why didn’t you verify the information that could save American lives and study the information that the Whistleblower Movement has conveyed to the US over and over again?

[这些]你们不查，你们查谁？查爆料的人？这事情早晚都要有交代的，对吧？今天的10点半大家一定要去看C-SPAN，国会山那个电视台，会很热闹，很有意思。

You did not investigate these problems. Who did you investigate? Did you investigate the people who blow the whistle? Sooner or later, you’re going to have to explain what you’ve done. Right? Everybody should watch the C-SPAN broadcast at 10:30 today. Watch the TV station on Capitol Hill. The hearing today will be hilarious and interesting.

用中国教授的话[说]，不是破绽百出。经过各种盘问，科学家在美国的遭遇会破“腚”百出。[美国]这个国家已经被共产党给彻底绑架了。

When Dr. Yan’s experience in the US is carefully investigated, all kinds of irregularities will be exposed. In the words of a Chinese professor, everything will come out loud and clear. The CCP has completely kidnaped the US.
