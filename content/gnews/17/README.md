英文標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep225: The suspension of Mongolian language education at Inner Mongolia continued to esclate

視頻重點

1. 中共內地糧食危機日趨嚴重，快速增加美國小麥等農產品購買，中共糧食充足的謊言不攻自破。
2. 在中共”五個不答應”的宣傳下，百姓逐漸清醒，在網路上勇敢表達反對意見，不會為了權貴去犧牲。
3. 內蒙取消蒙語教學事件持續發酵，中共假意聽取百姓意見，實際禁言，並武裝包圍學校，恐嚇並傷害學生及家長。取消蒙語教學開聽證會只是做樣子。現場不聽取任何意見。
4. 9月4日，大陸網友爆料，安徽蕪湖水災後45天仍然斷水斷電，中共對百姓生死不顧，謊言不斷。
5. （9月4日）三年前的今天，我在華盛頓特區新聞發布會告訴美國我有來自中共的兩份內部絕密文件。其中一份是關於中共在美國派駐間諜，他們在紐約的中國銀行工作。另一份是關於中共幹掉美國的計劃。第三份絕密文件，在新聞發布會之前，我在洗手間把它燒掉了。我燒掉的文件，是中共的《13579絕密文件》。


1. Food crisis in mainland China is getting more serious and the purchase of American wheat and other agricultural products has been increasing significantly, self crushing the CCP’s lie of plentiful provisions.
2. Under the propaganda of the CCP’s “Five Never-Agree”, people started to be clear-headed progressively and expressed their opposition on the internet boldly, that they would not sacrifice for the wealthy and powerful class.
3. The suspension of Mongolian language education at Inner Mongolia continued to esclate. The CCP pretended to listen to the opinions from people, but actually silenced them, surrounded schools with armed forces, threatening and harming students and parents. The hearing of the suspension of Mongolian language education is just a show. No advice were taken on board at the scene.
4. On September 4, netizens from mainland China revealed that water and electricity had been out for 45 days after the flood in Wuhu, Anhui.The CCP have shown zero attentionn or concern on whether people live or die but keep lying.
5. (With War Room, 9/4)September 4th, 2017, I was at a press conference in Washington D.C. to tell the U.S. that I had two internal top secret, highly classified documents from the insider of the Chinese Communist Party. One was about the CCP spies stationed in the U.S. who were working in Bank of China in New York. The other is about the Chinese Communist plan to take down America. The third higly classified document, I burned it in the bathroom before the press conference.  The document I burned was the CCP’s  “13579 top classified document”..
