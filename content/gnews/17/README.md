> 2. **On substitution mutations within the Spike protein. **Lines 16-18: Substitution mutations that are hydrophobic and classified as minor in the report, are structurally significant and not minor; many mutations are lysines to phenylalanines, which alter the structure, or phenylalanine to tyrosine which alter the charge of the side group.


【评议者】

关于刺突蛋白里的置换。第16-18行，在报告中疏水性的置换突变被归类为轻微的，但其在结构上是显著的而不是轻微的；许多突变由赖氨酸到苯丙氨酸地改变是结构性的，也有从苯丙氨酸到酪氨酸，改变侧基的负荷。


> Response: The comments here showed how shockingly ignorant Warmbrod et al. are in structural biology and biochemistry.
> 
> First, in our report, we pointed out that the hydrophobic substitutions specified would not alter the interaction between spike and ACE2. Recent data proved this to be the case: SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds to hACE2 exactly the same way as SARS RBD does. Clearly, the reviewers’ comment here has been proven wrong.
> 
> Second, Warmbrod et al. commented that many mutations are from lysines to phenylalanines. That is a ridiculous mistake. In our report, we have described these mutations as the following:
> 
> “*The few changes within the group of essential residues are almost exclusively hydrophobic ‘substitutions’ (I428*-&gt;*L, L443*-&gt;*F, F460*-&gt;*Y, L472*-&gt;*F, Y484*-&gt;*Q), which should not affect either protein folding or the hACE2-interaction.*“
> 
> The L443àF and L472àF mutations are what Warmbrod et al. were referring to here. However, they apparently do not possess the basic knowledge that “L” is the one-letter code for leucine, not lysine (one-letter code: K). Apparently, both mutations here are from leucine to phenylalanine, not from lysine to phenylalanine. It is simply unbelievable that Warmbrod et al. lack this very basic knowledge.
> 
> Finally, Warmbrod et al. described that mutation from phenylalanine to tyrosine would alter the charge of the residue. This is also plainly wrong. Neither of these two residues is charged. Warmbrod et al.’s level of knowledge in structural biology and biochemistry is embarrassingly low. They have once again proved that they are completely unqualified as reviewers for this report (and any other report involving structural biology or biochemistry).


【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人这里的评议显示出他们在生物结构学和生物化学上惊人的无知。

首先，在我们的报告里指出，这种疏水性置换不会改变刺突和受体的相互作用。最新的数据证明了这一点：新冠绑定域精确地以SARS的方式绑定人类受体。很显然，评议者的这一评议被证明是错误的。

第二，沃姆布罗德等人评议说，许多变异是从赖氨酸到苯丙氨酸。这是可笑的错误。在报告里我们描述了如下的变异：

“*基本残基组中的几处变化几乎完全是疏水性的‘替代’（I42–&gt;L，L443–&gt;F，F460–&gt;Y，L472–&gt;F，Y484–&gt;Q），这不应影响蛋白质折叠或与人类受体的相互作用。*”

“L443–&gt;F，F460–&gt;Y，L472–&gt;F”就是沃姆布罗德等人引用的部分。然而，他们显然没有基本知识，“L”是亮氨酸的单字母缩写，而不是赖氨酸（字母“K”）。显然，这里的两个变异都是从亮氨酸到苯丙氨酸，不是从赖氨酸到苯丙氨酸。沃姆布罗德等人连这种基本知识都没有，简直令人难以置信。

最后，沃姆布罗德等人说，从苯丙氨酸到酪氨酸的变异会改变侧基的负荷。这同样显然是错误的——这两者都没有负荷。沃姆布罗德等人在生物结构学和生物化学上的知识水平低得令人尴尬。他们再次证明，他们作为本报告（以及其他任何关于生物结构和生物化学的报告）的评议者是不合格的。


> 3. **Quasiviruses and evolution of RNA viruses. **Lines 23-26: The authors make teleological assumptions in this passage. “As elaborated below, the way that SARS-CoV-2 RBM [receptor- binding motif] resembles SARS-CoV RBM and the overall sequence conservation pattern between SARS-CoV-2 and ZC45/ZXC21 are highly unusual. Collectively, this suggests that portions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have not been derived from natural quasi-species viral particle evolution.” Currently, not enough is understood about SARS quasispecies to argue definitively that a certain population arose from another or to eliminate the possibility of said evolution. Many of the Yan and colleagues’ arguments could be explained by a mixture of convergent evolution, quasispecies, sampling bias, methodology issues, and/or a common ancestor.


【评议者】

类病毒和RNA病毒的演变。第23-26行。作者在这段里做了有目的之假设。“如下所述，新冠绑定域绑定类似SARS的，同时新冠与ZC45/ZXC21在整体序列上高度一致是极不寻常的。综合而言，这说明新冠的部分基因非源自于自然的准物种病毒粒子进化”。目前，对SARS准种序列没有足够的了解，不能确切立论说某物种来自于另一物种，或是排除假定演变的可能性。闫等人的许多论点无法用综合趋同进化、准物种、样本偏差、方法论问题以及/或一个共同祖先来解释。


> Response: Warmbrod et al. are intentionally distorting the truth of our report with the goal of tricking their readers to believe that our theories are flawed.
> 
> In our actual report, what followed the above-quoted writing of ours were detailed analyses showing how none of the possible evolutionary routes could produce SARS-CoV-2 through natural evolution. Our analyses considered all aspects mentioned here by Warmbrod et al., including convergent evolution, recombination, quasispecies evolution, selection pressure (sampling bias), common ancestor, etc. We specified in great detail how each of the possible routes is impossible and therefore dismissed.
> 
> By pulling together the words, Warmbrod et al. falsified a vague impression that the natural evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is possible. However, not a single plausible evolutionary route for the natural occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 was provided by Warmbrod et al. that could explain the unusual features displayed in its genome. Their comment here is simply not a valid counter-argument against our analyses, which were detailed and fully elaborated.


【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人是在故意歪曲我们报告的真相，以实现他们欺骗读者，令其相信我们的报告是错误的这一目的。

我们报告里实际对以上部分有详细的分析。分析显示出，任何可能的自然演变途径都无法产生新冠。我们的分析考虑了所有沃姆布罗德等人提到的方面，包括趋同进化、重组、准物种进化、选择压力（样本偏差），共同祖先等等。我们详细说明了为什么每种可能的途径都是不可能的，因而被排除了。

靠堆砌文字，沃姆布罗德等人制造出假象，即新冠的自然演变是可能的。然而，沃姆布罗德等人没有提供任何一条供新冠自然出现演变途径的证明，能解释它内在基因组的不寻常特征。他们这条评议根本不是针对我们的详细而全面的分析的有效反论。


> 4. **Viral recombination. **Lines 30, 31, and 43: The description of viral recombination does not accurately describe how this process occurs in viruses. Viral recombination is a complex event, which is not a “swapping” of entire genes, as the authors suggest, but a common, important part of viral evolution. Reassortment can occur, but only in segmented, positive-sense RNA viruses. It is likely that ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 underwent viral recombination, though this is not necessarily a complete exchange of entire gene segments.


【评议者】

病毒重组。第30、31和43行，关于病毒重组的描述并未准确描述这个过程是如何在病毒里发生的。病毒重组是复杂的事情，不只是像作者说的那样“替换”掉一整个基因，而是病毒演变的一个重要部分。重组可能出现，但只在分段的、阳性的RNA病毒里。也许新冠的祖先经历过重组，虽然这不一定是整个基因片段的完全交换。


> Response: Warmbrod et al. once again distorted our report in making this comment and criticism. The lines that Warmbrod et al. referred to here described how the RBM could be swapped in a recombination event. The RBM, which is the receptor-binding motif, is not an “entire gene.” Instead, it is a small segment of the spike gene. Clearly, we did not state that recombination leads to the swapping of only entire genes. Warmbrod et al. described the situation incorrectly, which is inconsistent with what was written in our report.
> 
> Also, it seems that Warmbrod et al. saw the word “complete” in our description and automatically assumed we meant complete/entire genes. In our actual writing, we described a virus with a “*relatively ‘complete’ RBM (in reference to SARS)*.” Here, complete RBM meant an RBM that does not have significant gaps compared to the SARS RBM. The inadequacy of Warmbrod et al. as reviewers is, once again, astonishing.


【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人又在歪曲我们的报告来做评议和批评。他们在此引用的那些段落（在我们的报告里）实际上描述了在重组中RBM是如何被替换掉的。受体绑定域，并不是“一整个基因”。相反，它是刺突基因的一小片段。显然，我们并没说过重组只会替换掉一整个基因。沃姆布罗德等人做了错误的叙述，那不是我们报告里的话。

另外，似乎沃姆布罗德等人看到了我们报告里“完全”这个词就自动地假定我们的意思是一整个基因。我们实际上说的，描述了一个有“相对完整RBM”的病毒（参考SARS）。这里“完整RBM”意思是，与SARS的RBM相比没有显著缺口的RBM。沃姆布罗德等人作为评议者的低能，再次令人吃惊。


> 1. **The potential for zoonotic emergence of coronaviruses. **Line 9: There is not enough information available in the scientific literature to know whether strains related to SARS-CoV-2 may infect humans or if infections are possible but limited. Therefore, statements made by the authors about the infectivity of ZC45 are unsupported.


【评议者】

冠状病毒在动物传染性疾病中出现的可能性。第9行，科学文献中没有足够信息证明，与新冠相关的菌株是否会感染人类，或其感染力是否有限。所以，作者对ZC45的叙述是缺乏支持的。


> Response: Like many bat coronaviruses that have been studied before, ZC45 has large gaps in its RBM and is missing key residues that are indispensable for hACE2 interaction. Such viruses could not bind ACE2 to infect human cells. The way to convert them into human cell-targeting viruses was through gain-of-function research, where either the Spike gene or just its RBM was swapped with the SARS RBM as demonstrated repeatedly by Zhengli Shi and colleagues.
> 
> Any competent scientist in the field would agree with our assessment that ZC45 “*would not be able to infect humans*.” The inability to recognize so speaks for the lack of knowledge of Warmbrod et al. in the biology of coronaviruses.


【闫博士】

回应：就像许多先前被研究过的蝙蝠冠状病毒一样，ZC45在它的RBM上有巨大缺口并缺少感染人类受体不可或缺的部分。这些病毒无法绑定受体而感染人类细胞。因此，把它们转变为以人类为目标的病毒的方法是，通过功能获得性研究，其中或是刺突基因或仅仅是RBM被SARS的RBM替换掉了，如石正丽和她的同事们反复证明的。

任何此一领域有能力的科学家都会同意我们的论点，即ZC45“没有能力感染人类”。认识不到这一点，说明沃姆布罗德等人在冠状病毒生物学上缺乏知识。


> 2. **On intermediate hosts in viral evolution. **Lines 21-23: Viruses can have complicated evolutionary origins, sometimes with intermediate hosts, as seen with influenza; influenza viruses are also known to crossover into humans. The human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor may be optimal for SARS-CoV-2, but recent work has found that SARS-CoV-2 can actually use multiple ACE2 receptors,4 but not mice ACE2. More sampling needs to be done, but assertions about whether the hACE2 is the best receptor to bind SARS-CoV-2 cannot be supported at this time.


【评议者】

关于病毒演变中的中间宿主。第21-23行，病毒可能有复杂的进化来源，有时伴随中间宿主，如流感所示——已知流感病毒也是跨种传入人类的。人类细胞受体对新冠或许是最佳的，但最近的研究发现，新冠实际上能利用多种受体而非小白鼠受体。现在还不能有把握断言，人类受体对新冠是最佳的，还需要研究更多样本。


> Response: Contrary to this comment of Warmbrod et al., all recent data showed that, although SARS-CoV-2 can bind ACE2 from different animals, hACE2 exhibits the highest affinity with SARS-CoV-2 Spike. This is supported by multiple publications and not opposed by any27-30. Warmbrod et al. are once again mistaken.


【闫博士】回应：

与沃姆布罗德等人的评议相反，所有最近数据显示，尽管新冠能绑定不同动物，但人类细胞受体与新冠刺突间吸引力最高。这是被许多发表作品支持而非反对的。沃姆布罗德等人这次又错了。


> 3. **Zoonotic emergence of coronaviruses in history. **Lines 36-38: Coronaviruses have caused human disease before, including SARS and MERS, and many have pointed to warning signs that coronaviruses could become a serious problem, which was not heeded prior to SARS-CoV-2. These facts are contradicted by the authors who also describe SARS-CoV-2 as “intelligent,” which is teleological and counterfactual.


【评议者】

历史上的冠状病毒性的动物传染性疾病。第36-38行，冠状病毒以前曾引起人类疾病，包括SARS和MERS。并且很多人提出了警告，即冠状病毒可能成为一个严重问题，但这些在新冠之前未得到重视。这些事实与作者相矛盾，他们还有目的地违反事实地说新冠是“智能的”。


> Response: Warmbrod et al. once again distorted our report in making this comment and criticism.
> 
> In our report, the word “intelligent” was not used to describe the SARS-CoV-2 virus but rather used to describe the unusual way the SARS-CoV-2 RBM resembles the SARS RBM – having all key residues preserved and yet the majority of the non-essential residues changed. Our exact words were:
> 
> “*Random mutations across the genome would have to have occurred to eventually shape the RBM to its current form – resembling SARS-CoV RBM in a highly intelligent manner.*“
> 
> It is the “design” that we describe as intelligent, not the virus. Our description here was accurate and factual, not counterfactual.
> 
> Furthermore, other coronaviruses causing human diseases in the past do not automatically dismiss the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could be a product of gain-of-function work. The comment by Warmbrod et al. here lacks basic logic.


【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人又歪曲我们的报告来做评议和批评。

在我们的报告里，“智能的”这个词并未被用来描述新冠，而是用来描述新冠的RBM与SARS的RBM相似的方式——所有关键残基都保留了下来而大部分不重要的残基变异了。我们确切的文字如下：

“*必须发生基因组上的随机突变，才能最终将RBM塑造成当前形式——以高度智能的方式使其类似于SARS-CoV RBM。*”

我们说的是这个“设计”是智能的，而不是这个病毒。我们此处的描述是准确、真实的，不是相矛盾的。

另外，过去其他引起人类疾病的冠状病毒的存在，并不自然而然就排除了新冠是功能获得性研究产物的可能性。沃姆布罗德等人这条评议缺乏逻辑。


> 1. **Lack of evidence regarding gain of function research in coronaviruses. **Line 2: Some gain of function research using coronaviruses has been published, but the author’s statement of “abundant” literature in this area overstates the amount known. The papers referenced do not support the author’s claim that such research led to human competent viruses. In one paper, Ren et al inserted the Spike protein gene of all SARS-CoV-like viruses (not SARS) into a viral backbone and did not use the entire SARS virus or infect live animals.


【评议者】

缺乏关于功能获得性研究的证据。第2行，一些冠状病毒功能获得性实验被发表过，但作者关于此一领域文献“丰富”的说法高估了已知的数量。引证的论文不支持作者的主张，即此类研究导致能传染人类的病毒。在一篇论文里，雷恩等人把一个SARS类（不是SARS）病毒刺突蛋白基因插入一个病毒骨架，但没使用整个SARS病毒或是感染活的动物。


> Response: The fact that we cited representative references here to prove our point does not negate our statement that the evidence on gain-of-function research is abundant. More such references had been provided in section 2.2 step 1 of our report. The evidence undeniably proves that gain-of-function research on coronaviruses has been carried out repeatedly and the techniques involved are mature and well established. Ralph Baric also commented, based on his knowledge of the literature, that “*nowadays you could engineer a coronavirus without leaving any trace*.” When the literature support is this fully and firmly, it is considered abundant.
> 
> Even though not all publications used SARS as the backbone and/or infected whole animals, all of these studies have produced novel coronaviruses that could infect human cells or cells carrying the human ACE2 receptor. The potential of these recombinant viruses to infect humans is nothing but evident.


【闫博士】回应：

事实是，我们此处引证的代表性参考资料证明（而非反对）我们的论点，即功能获得性实验的证据是丰富的。在我们报告的2.2步骤1里，我们提供了更多参考资料。这些证据确凿地证明，冠状病毒的功能获得性实验反复被进行，且相关技术是成熟和完善的。拉尔夫-巴里克也基于他的文献知识评议说，“今天你可以不留痕迹地加工一个冠状病毒。”当文献支持如此充分和坚实的时候，我们认为那就叫丰富的。

即使不是所有发表的作品都使用SARS作为骨架以及/或感染整个动物，这些研究已经制造出新的能够感染人类细胞或是有人类受体细胞的冠状病毒。这些潜在的感染人类的重组病毒就是证据。


> 2. **Lack of restriction sites in the proposed viral backbone ZC45. **Figure 5: The authors describe a possible pathway for designing viruses that is out of step with current scientific methods for gene editing, casting doubt on both their analysis and their conclusions. While using restriction sites as presented are theoretically possible in SARS-CoV-2, based on the authors’ own analysis, ZC45 does not have the necessary restriction sites (of EcoRI and BstEII). Therefore, ZC45 would have to be genetically modified beyond the sequence presented for restriction digestion to be possible. This negates the authors’ argument that ZC45 is the obvious backbone of SARS-CoV-2. Restriction digests are not favored for the manipulation of RNA viruses due to several obstacles: genome sizes, viral proofreading enzymes that can limit the success of restriction enzymes, and the ability to recover viruses after reverse genetic manipulation.


【评议者】

在假设的病毒骨架ZC45里缺少限制性切位点。图表5，作者描述设计病毒的一条可能途径与目前基因编辑的科学手段是不相符合的，这给他们的分析和结论投下了阴影。当目前在新冠上使用限制性切位点在理论上可能时，基于作者自己的分析，ZC45没有必须的限制性切位点（EcoRI和BstEII）。所以，ZC45必须经过基因改造，超出所提供的序列，才能实现限制性酶切。这否定了作者的ZC45显然是新冠骨架的论点。限制性酶切不适合加工RNA病毒，因为严重的障碍：基因规模、病毒校正酶限制了限制性酶切的成功，以及削弱了反向基因操作后恢复病毒的能力。


> Response: The comments here by Warmbrod et al. are completely mistaken and full of error.
> 
> The genetic manipulation pathway we described is not out of step with current scientific methods. In fact, two top experts in coronavirus research, Fang Li and Ralph Baric, both published articles in 2020, respectively, where they used restriction digestion and ligation to generate their constructs of interest.
> 
> Also, their comment “*viral proofreading enzymes that can limit the success of restriction enzymes*” is so wrong that it is laughable. Here, they argued that the presence of proofreading mechanisms in a coronavirus would obstruct laboratory manipulation of the viral genome using restriction enzymes. However, proofreading enzyme functions *in vivo*when the virus is replicating in cells; it ensures that viral replication happens in a way that prevents the accumulation of a large number of mutations. Restriction digestion, however, is a method of genetic modification often used in gain-of-function research, which takes place *in vitro*before any *in vivo*experiments. In reality, it does not matter whether a coronavirus Spike is constructed by restriction digestion methods or not, and the viral genome replication would be safeguarded by the proofreading mechanism regardless. The comment by Warmbrod et al. here showed their complete ignorance in coronavirus biology, genetic engineering, and gain-of-function research. This group of “reviewers” is a complete disgrace to peer review and to the profession of scientists.
> 
> The need to introduce EcoRI and BstEII sites into ZC45 does not negate the possibility of ZC45 being used as the template for the creation of SARS-CoV-2. As we have described in our report, the introduction of these sites is extremely convenient and routine for trained molecular biologists. Furthermore, these two sites could even be introduced earlier through DNA synthesis of Spike, which requires even less time and effort in accomplishing. In fact, introducing restriction sites into spike through DNA synthesis had been done by Dr. Zhengli Shi in 2008. There, Shi and colleagues synthesized codon-optimized spike genes. They subsequently used restriction enzyme digestion methods to swap the RBM. Although Shi and colleagues did not specify which restriction sites were used for the swap, it is no doubt that these sites were conveniently introduced through DNA synthesis. Warmbrod et al. once again characterized the issue in a way that is inconsistent with the scientific truth.
> 
> Finally, we did not propose that genetic manipulation was done on a whole-genome level. Instead, we clearly showed that the genetic manipulation of Spike should have been done separately in a cloning vector, which is the typical approach in the field. Therefore, Warmbrod et al.’s claim that genome size could be an obstacle to genetic manipulation is, therefore, completely irrelevant to the pathway we proposed. It showed yet again that their understanding of the contents of our report was superficial and overwhelmingly mistaken.


【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人此处的评议满是错误。

我们描述的基因改造方式并不与目前科学方法不一致。事实是，两个冠状病毒研究的顶级专家，李放和拉尔夫.巴里克，都分别在2020年发表过论文，其中他们以限制性酶切和结扎来制造他们感兴趣的设计。

还有，他们说“病毒校正酶限制了限制性酶切的成功”是如此错误，简直可笑。他们在此处说，冠状病毒里校正机制的存在会阻碍用限制性酶切在实验室改造病毒。然而，当病毒在活体细胞中复制时校正酶才起作用——它确保病毒以防止积累大量突变的方式进行复制。而限制性酶切是功能获得性研究常用的基因编辑方法，它在任何体内实验之前都是在体外进行的！现实中，冠状病毒刺突是否是通过限制酶切的方法构建并不重要，无论如何，校对机制都会保护病毒基因组的复制。沃姆布罗德等人的这条评议显示出，他们在病毒生物学、基因工程学、功能获得性实验上完全无知，这组评议者完全是同行评议和科学的耻辱。

把EcoRI和BstEII引入ZC45并不与ZC45被用作制造新冠的模板相矛盾。如我们在报告中所述，这两个位点的引入，对于训练有素的分子生物学家是极其便利和常规的。另外，这两个位点甚至可能通过刺突DNA合成更早地被引入，那样完成病毒改造所要花的时间和精力更少。事实上，石正丽2008年就通过DNA合成，做过把限制性切位点引入刺突的试验。石和同事们在那里合成了密码子最优化的刺突基因，他们随后用限制性酶切位点方法替换了RBM。尽管石和同事们没有说到底用了什么切位点做的替换，毫无疑问，这些切位点是便利地通过DNA合成引入的。沃姆布罗德等人再次用与科学真相矛盾的方式描述事情。

最后，我们并没有假设基因改造是在全基因组的水平上做的。相反，我们清楚地显示，刺突的基因改造是分别、分开在克隆载体上做的，这是此一领域的典型做法。所以，沃姆布罗德等人说基因组规模会成为基因改造的障碍，是与我们所说的方法完全不相干的。这再次显示他们对我们报告的理解是肤浅和压倒性错误的。


> 1. **On restriction sites present within the Spike protein. **Lines 6-9: Restriction enzyme sites are found in all genomes and naturally occur frequently. For instance, in a commonly used adenovirus vector, the BstEII restriction enzyme site occurs 10 times. The frequency of restriction site distribution is due to the fact that they comprise stretches of 6 or 8 consecutive nucleotides, which have high—and measurable—probabilities of occurring by chance within a given genome. With contemporary gene-editing methodologies, restriction sites are rarely used. These arguments aside, Yan and colleagues falsely assert the existence of restriction enzyme sites in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence, but not in the Spike gene sequence of other beta coronaviruses, is evidence of genetic manipulation, or that the presence of restriction sites is rare. A New England BioLabs site search for restriction enzyme sites in the 5′ end of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence revealed at least 7 other restriction sites in the RBM, in addition to the EcoRI site, Yan et al cited as evidence of manipulation.


【评议者】

关于在刺突蛋白里出现的限制性切位点。第6-9行，限制性酶切位点在所有基因组中被发现并且经常自然地出现。例如，在一种普遍使用的腺病毒载体里，BstEII限制性位点出现了10次。限制性位点分布的经常性是由于这一事实：它们包含6-8个连续核苷酸长度，在一个基因组里就有了高频和可计算的随机出现的可能性。以当前基因编辑的方法，限制性切位点很少被使用。撇开这些，闫和同事们错误地宣称，在新冠序列里存在的限制性位点（但它们不在其他β冠状病毒刺突序列里）是基因改造的证据，或这些位点是罕见的。一个新英格兰生物实验室网站在新冠的尾部序列5’处搜索限制性切位点，除了闫引证的作为改造证据的EcoRI之外，在RBM里还发现了至少7个限制性切位点。


> Response: Warmbrod et al. failed to acknowledge here that, in this comment of theirs, they left out the significant context that we described in our report.
> 
> In our report, we asserted that the existence of EcoRI and BstEII sites at either end of the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 was the “smoking gun” of genetic engineering. Importantly, this assertion was made in the context of the following key facts. First, EcoRI and BstEII at these two locations are unique only to SARS-CoV-2, but not to any other lineage B β coronavirus (excluding the fabricated coronaviruses published after the start of the outbreak). Second, the introduction of an EcoRI site breaks a conserved amino acid, Threonine (Thr). All naturally occurring lineage B β coronaviruses have Thr at this location. SARS-CoV-2 is the only one that carries a Serine (Ser) here, which is interlocked with having an EcoRI site here. Third, where EcoRI and BstEII sites are located matches exactly where Dr. Zhengli Shi and Dr. Fang Li (Shi’s long-term collaborator and structural biology expert of Spike-ACE2 interactions) had cut and pasted RBMs using similar restriction enzyme digestion methods. Fourth, we have reasoned in previous segments how the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 could not have been derived from natural evolution. Our assertion (the existence of EcoRI and BstEII sites at either end of the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 is the “smoking gun” of genetic engineering) was derived from considering all of these facts together. Apparently, Warmbrod et al. took our judgment out of its significant context, which was the opposite of being scientific. On the other hand, the fact that they could only “criticize” our analysis after taking things out of context proves the validity of our conclusion here. The genetic manipulation of RBM/Spike is undeniable.
> 
> Finally, the existence of contemporary gene-editing technologies does not mean that the genetic manipulation of the RBM here could not be accomplished by using restriction enzyme digestions. In fact, Dr. Fang Li swapped the RBM using restriction enzyme digestion methods in 2020. Dr. Baric used restriction digestion in his recently published work, too. Clearly, for top experts, this old-fashioned technique was, as we have described, convenient and still the method of choice.


【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人在此处无法坦白的是，他们在评议里把我们报告中重要的上下文都撇掉了。

我们在报告里断言，新冠RBM两端EcoRI和BstEII位点的存在是基因改造的确凿证据。重要的是，这一断言是基于上下文中如下重要事实上做出的：首先，EcoRI和BstEII位点在这两个位置只对新冠是独特的，而非其他任何B系β冠状病毒（在大流行爆发后发表的伪造冠状病毒除外）。第二，EcoRI和BstEII位点的引入打断了一个守恒的氨基酸，苏氨酸（Thr）。所有自然的B系β冠状病毒都在这个位置有Thr。因为这里的EcoRI位点的关系，新冠是唯一在这里出现丝氨酸（Ser）的。第三，EcoRI和BstEII位点所在的位置精确地吻合石正丽和李放博士（石的长期合作者兼刺突和受体相互作用的结构生物学专家）曾用类似的限制性酶切位点手法，切除并粘贴过RBM的位置。第四，我们已经在之前的部分推论过，为什么新冠的RBM不可能来自于自然进化。我们的断言（新冠RBM两端的EcoRI和BstEII位点是基因工程的确凿证据）是来自于上述所有事实的综合。显然，沃姆布罗德等人把我们的判断从它的重要上下文中提取出来，这与科学精神相违背。另外，他们只能把东西从上下文里提取出来进行“批评”的事实证明，我们这里的结论的正确性——RBM/刺突的基因改造是无可置疑的。

最后，现时代的基因编辑技术的存在并不意味着这一RBM改造不可能被用于限制性位点的完成。事实上，李放博士2020年用限制性切位点调换了RBM。巴里克博士也在他最近发表的作品中用了限制性位点。很清楚，对于顶级专家，过去流行的技术，如我们所说的，是便利的并仍是可选的方法。


> 1. The **possibility of convergent evolution in beta coronaviruses. **Lines 10-12: Yan et al state that there is only 1 evolutionary pathway that could explain the appearance of SARS-CoV-2—a homologous recombination event. However, convergent evolution is another pathway for the development of the furin cleavage site, which would result in SARS-CoV-2 having the cleavage site similar to non-beta coronaviruses. Convergent evolution is a well-established phenomenon in biology.


【评议者】

β冠状病毒趋同进化的可能性。第10-12行，闫等人说，只有一种进化途径能解释新冠的出现，某种同源重组事件。然而，对于弗林酶切位点而言，趋同进化是另一个发展途径，那会导致新冠有类似于非β冠状病毒的位点。趋同进化是生物学的历史悠久的现象。


> Response: Warmbrod et al. are incorrect in making this statement. The difference between our analyses on this issue and Warmbrod et al.’s comment is that we analyzed the molecular basis of the evolutionary pathways, including convergent evolution, while Warmbrod et al. shared an opinion without any analysis or evidence.
> 
> In convergent evolution, different viruses might develop the same trait under certain evolutionary pressure. However, convergent evolution is the cumulative result of numerous evolutionary events, which at the molecular level are either random mutations or homologous recombination. Acquiring the furin-cleavage site requires 12 nucleotides to be inserted at this junction region of the spike gene. Such an insertion could not be possibly achieved through random mutations. Therefore, we state that the only possible route for its natural occurrence would be recombination. We then offered our detailed analyses to show why recombination also could not be responsible for the emergence of the furin-cleavage site at the S1/2 junction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike. Clearly, our analyses took all possibilities, including convergent evolution, into consideration and dismissed all possible ways of the natural occurrence of this particular furin-cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2.

【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人这么说是错误的。我们的分析和沃姆布罗德等人的评议的差异在于，我们分析了进化途径的分子基础，包括趋同进化，而沃姆布罗德等人只是提出一个观点而没有任何分析和证据。

在趋同进化中，不同病毒在一定的进化压力下可能发展出相同的特征。然而，趋同进化是无数进化事件的累积结果，这在分子级别要么是随机变异，要么是同源重组。获得弗林酶切位点需要12个核苷酸插入在刺突基因的这个联接部。这样的插入不可能通过随机变异获得。所以，我们说唯一的自然出现的可能是重组。于是我们提供了我们详细的分析，说明为什么重组也无法导致新冠刺突S1/S2联接部的弗林酶切位点的出现。显然，我们的分析考虑到了所有可能性，包括趋同进化，并排除了新冠这独特弗林酶切位点自然出现的所有可能性。

相反，沃姆布罗德等人的评议没有分子水平的坚实的分析。他们此处的论点仅仅是观点，既没有理论也没有文献支持。


> 2. **The evolution of a furin cleavage site. **Lines 14-16: The authors argue that the existence of polybasic furin cleavage sites in other coronaviruses implies that convergent evolution could not have played a role in the evolution of the furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2. The furin cleavage site refers to a specific position at the S1/S2 junction in SARS-CoV-2. This is a sequence of amino acids where the host (human) enzyme, furin, can cleave. This furin cleavage is essential for the proper maturation of the Spike glycoprotein and subsequent cell-to-cell membrane fusion in the host. They present the divergent furin cleavage site sequence in SARS-CoV-2 as evidence that homologous recombination between an ancestor beta coronavirus and a furin cleavage site-containing coronavirus is impossible. The argument that homologous recombination is not a likely factor in fact supports a hypothesis of convergent evolution.


【评议者】

弗林酶切位点的进化。第14-16行，作者说多碱弗林酶切位点在其他冠状病毒的存在暗示，趋同进化不可能在新冠的弗林酶切位点进化中起作用。该弗林酶切位点在新冠的S1/S2联接部。这是一个宿主（人类）的弗林酶可以裂解的氨基酸序列。这弗林酶切位点对于宿主体内刺突糖蛋白恰当的成熟和随后的细胞间的膜融合很重要。他们提出在新冠中有不同的弗林酶切位点序列的出现，这是不可能发生在某种祖先β冠状病毒和某种含弗林酶切位点的冠状病毒间同源重组的证据。同源重组不是一个可能因素的论点，实际上，其支持了趋同进化的假设。


> Response: Here Warmbrod et al. argued for the same thing as they did in their previous comment. As we have explained in the above response, their argument is mistaken as there is no molecular basis for the convergent evolution to produce the furin-cleavage site naturally.
> 
> Convergent evolution not involving recombination, which is equivalent to evolution through random mutations only, would not result in the insertion of 12 nucleotides and thus the natural occurrence of the furin-cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction in SARS-CoV-2. Warmbrod et al’s arguments here are baseless at the molecular level and clearly do not survive robust analyses.
> 
> It is also important to note that, in proposing their fatally flawed theory of convergent evolution, Warmbrod et al. clearly agreed with our analyses and conclusion that homologous recombination could not lead to the natural occurrence of the furin cleavage site at this location in SARS-CoV-2 Spike. These facts further prove that this furin cleavage site could not have come from nature.

沃姆布罗德等人如之前的评议一样，提出了相同的论点。如我们在之前回应里解释的，他们的论点是错误的，因为弗林酶切位点在自然界趋同进化没有分子基础。

趋同进化不包括重组，它只等同于随机变异，不会导致12个核苷酸插入而自然造成弗林酶切位点在新冠的S1/S2联接部出现。沃姆布罗德等人此处的论点是没有分子级别基础的，因而显然其无法支撑坚实的分析。

有一点很重要值得注意，在提出他们的本质上错误的趋同进化理论时，沃姆布罗德等人显然同意我们的分析和结论，即同源进化不可能导致弗林酶切位点在新冠刺突这个位置的出现。这个事实更加证明，此弗林酶切位点不可能来自于自然界。
