## 新聞秘書凱裡·麥肯尼主持新聞發佈會(7/16)
`2020-07-18 03:00 GM31` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hant/268076/)

在[7月16日](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-7-16-2020/)的白宮新聞發佈會上，白宮發言人Kayleigh McEnany肯定了總統在削減監管制度的取得的成效，彙報了在新冠疫情下川普政府採取的措施和對疫情的重視程度，並回答了相關問題，主要包括中共黨員是否能入境美國，推特公司被黑對川普總統的影響，選票造假的擔憂，疾控中心的新指南和資料的過渡到HHS系統，記者會最後以奧巴馬-拜登政府和川普政府對流行病的對策進行比較結尾。



MS. MCENANY: Hello, everyone. This afternoon, President Trump will deliver remarks on rolling back regulations to help all Americans. Deregulation has been a top priority of this President. The President reversed the disastrous over-regulation of the Obama-Biden administration. Under President Trump, seven deregulatory actions have been taken for every one new regulation. This amounted to $50 billion in regulatory cost savings.

麥肯尼女士：大家下午好，川普總統將就削減監管發表講話以幫助所有美國人。解除管制一直是總統的首要任務。總統逆轉了奧巴馬-拜登政府災難性的過度監管。在川普總統的領導下，每一項新法規就有七項放鬆管制措施。這相當於節省了500億美元的監管成本。

And it is important to note that this deregu- — deregulation agenda lowers costs for every American. The cost of these burdensome regulations fall disproportionately and benefit disproportionately lower-income Americans. So, this President took action to roll back the burdensome regulations that harm low-income communities and make sure that these lower-income Americans are taken care of.

值得注意的是，此放鬆管制的議程降低了每個美國人的成本。這些負擔沉重的監管成本不成比例地下降，低收入美國人也不成比例地受益。因此，總統採取行動，取消了損害低收入社區的繁瑣制度以確保低收入美國人得到照顧。

For example, the President’s deregulatory agenda will boost household income by $3,100 annually. Thanks to President Trump’s rolling back of the Obama-Biden-era CAFE standards, family — families will have access to cheaper cars. The President’s healthcare deregulation will also save patients nearly 10 percent on prescription drug costs.

例如，總統放鬆管制的議程將使家庭年收入增加3100美元。由於川普總統取消了奧巴馬-拜登時代的CAFE標準，家庭—眾多家庭將可以獲得更便宜的汽車。總統對醫療保健的放鬆管制還將為患者節省近10%的處方藥成本。

These real wins for the American people will disappear with a re-regulation agenda, which is why President Trump will continue to pursue his historic deregulatory activity.

對於美國人民，這些真正的獲利將隨著重新制定監管議程而消失，這就是為什麼川普總統將繼續推行 這個具有歷史意義的放鬆監管活動。

On another note: We saw encouraging news yesterday on vaccines. Moderna’s vaccine candidate is showing promising signs. They produced a positive, neutral immune response among the 45 participants in the study. This is comparable to what we see in recovered patients. And the bottom line is that, so far, we are seeing exactly what you would hope to see in a vaccine. They’re expected — the Moderna vaccine in particular is expected to reach phase three by late July, with 30,000 participants

另外，昨天我們也看到了關於疫苗的令人鼓舞的消息。Moderna公司的候選疫苗表現出令人鼓舞的跡象。他們在45名志願者中產生了陽性和中性的免疫反應。這與我們在康復病人身上看到的情況相當。最重要的是,到目前為止,我們所看到的正是你希望在疫苗中看到的。預計，特別是Moderna公司的疫苗將有望在7月底進入第三階段，屆時將有3萬名志願者。

And finally, on the therapeutics front, I just want to note: A very encouraging Regeneron contract. A $450 million contract for a monoclonal antibody cocktail. This is a bioengineered version of convalescent plasma, one of the several therapeutics available to treat COVID. It can be used for prophylaxis and treatment. And they say they could have up to 70 to 300 thousand doses — vials of this by the end of the summer or early fall.

最後，在治療方面，我想強調一下：一個非常鼓舞人心的再生合同。一份價值4.5億美元的單克隆抗體混合物合同。這個康復期血漿的生物工程版本，是治療新冠肺炎的幾種可用療法之一。可用於預防和治療，在夏末或初秋之前，他們可能會有7萬到30萬劑的劑量。

So Operation Warp Speed continues. We continue to see encouraging news on the therapeutics front. And with that, I will take your questions.

所以OWS公司在繼續研究。治療方面，我們繼續看到令人鼓舞的消息。接下來，我將回答大家的提問。

Geoff.

傑夫 。

Q: Thank you, Kayleigh. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said today that President Trump has left states to fend for themselves during this pandemic. He accused the President of not listening to medical experts. That is quite a takedown coming from a Republican governor.

問：謝謝，麥肯尼。馬里蘭州州長拉裡·霍根今天表示， 在這場大流行期間川普總統讓各州自行應對。他指責總統沒有聽取醫學專家的意見。這是一位共和黨州長的極力反駁。

MS. MCENANY: Yeah, it’s really striking, his comments, especially when you compare them to his past comments. This is revisionist history by Governor Hogan, and it stands in stark contrast to what he said on March 19th, where he praised the great communication that the President has had with governors. On March 19th, he also said, “Thank you. There’s been tremendous cooperation.”

答：是的，當你把他的評論跟過去的評論相比較時，真的很令人震驚。這是霍根州長的修正主義歷史，與他在3月19日的講話形成鮮明對比，當時他稱讚總統與州長們進行了良好的溝通。3月19日，他還說：“謝謝你們。我們有巨大的合作。”

And what is so striking to me about reading that op-ed is Governor Hogan begins with this dramatic April 18th scene where South Korea delivered tests, but just the day prior, he said something entirely different. He, in fact, thanked the President for the progress we’ve seen in federal and state coordination in recent weeks, and went on to praise testing capabilities, he said, with regard to some of the top needs of states, including ventilators and texting capabilities. So, 24 hours before this dramatic opening scene of his op-ed, he literally was praising the President of the United States for delivering on testing.

讀到這篇專欄文章讓我震驚的是，霍根州長從4月18日韓國病毒測試的戲劇性場景作為開頭，而就在前一天，他說了完全不同的話。事實上，他感謝總統最近幾周在聯邦和各州之間協調取得的進展，並繼續讚揚測試能力，他說，一些州最優先需要是呼吸機和短信能力。因此，在他的專欄文章戲劇性的開場24小時前，他從字面上在讚揚總統在測試上的成績。

Q: And how do you explain that President Trump is trailing his opponent by double digits both nationally and in battleground states, with majorities disapproving of his handling of race relations and the coronavirus response?

問：你如何解釋川普總統在全國和搖擺州的支持率都以兩位數落後於他的對手，多數人不贊成他處理種族關係和冠狀病毒反應的方式？

MS. MCENANY: So that would be a question for the campaign when it comes to campaign polling. But what I would say is we believe this President has great approval in this country. His historic COVID response speaks for itself with delivering on ventilators and testing, leading the world in the amount of testing we’ve provided; therapeutics; the 13 vaccine candidates — the Moderna example that I pointed out to you. This President’s response has been historic, and we believe his support in this country reflects that.

答：所以在競選投票時，這將是一個競選活動的問題。但我想說的是，我們相信總統在我們國家得到了極大的贊同。他對冠狀肺炎的歷史性回應說明了我們在呼吸機和測試方面的貢獻，我們提供的測試數量引領世界;治療方面有13種候選疫苗，我給你們指出的Moderna公司的例子。這位總統的反應是歷史性的，支持率就可以反映了這一點。

But with pertaining to battleground polling or campaign-related polling, I’d refer you there.

但如果是關於戰場投票或競選相關的投票，我建議你去那裡。

Yes.

是的。

Q: Kayleigh, we’ve seen the President hold a range of public events this week, but none of those events have been focused on the coronavirus. Why not?

問：凱裡，我們看到總統本周舉行了一系列公開活動，但這些活動都不是圍繞冠狀病毒展開的。為什麼呢？

MS. MCENANY: The President is routinely focused on the coronavirus. I think you’ll be hearing more about what we’re doing in the coming week. He’s hard at work. We talk about COVID every day from this podium. The task force is hard at work.

答：總統定期關注冠狀病毒。我想你會在接下來的一周聽到更多關於我們正在做的事情。他工作很努力，每天都在這個講臺上討論冠狀病毒疫情，工作小組都 在努力工作。

And I’m glad you ask about COVID, in particular, because I just want to read through some of the things that we are doing, which I think is — most important than what we’re saying is what we’re doing.

我很高興你特別提到冠狀病毒，但我只是想通讀一下正在做的一些事情，因我認為這是最重要的，而不是我們在說什麼。

And the White House has engaged in travel. Dr. Birx went to Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. I spoke with Dr. Birx this morning. She’s in Georgia today, heading to South Carolina tomorrow. HHS has deployed 19 teams across the country. We identify not where we see embers, but pre that. We identify where we might see an emergence, and we send teams there to address it in advance. So, we’re proactive.

白宮也開始行動。布瑞克斯博士去了路易斯安那州、密西西比州、阿拉巴馬州、喬治亞州和南卡羅來納州。今天早上我和布瑞克斯博士也交談過，她今天會在喬治亞州，明天將前往南卡羅來納州。衛生與公眾服務部在全國部署了19個小組。我們不知道在哪裡有疫情爆發，但是如果預先知道， 哪裡可能出現緊急事件，會派團隊提前解決。我們工作積極主動。

Dr. Birx routinely sends real-time data to governors. She gives them governors reports on remdesivir. We’ve surged it to Texas, Florida, California, Arizona. Sixty-five thousand vials went to these four states. And we’re also surging testing sites. So we’re doing stuff each and every day.

布瑞克斯博士定期向州長發送即時資料。她給州長們上報關於瑞得西韋的報告。我們已經把六萬五千瓶瑞得西韋帶到德克薩斯，佛羅里達，加利福尼亞，亞利桑那這四個州。 我們的測試點也在激增。因此，我們每天都在做事情。

Q: But, Kayleigh, surely you would agree this is the biggest challenge facing the public right now. Why aren’t we seeing it as the President’s biggest public priority?

問：但是，凱裡，你肯定會同意這是公眾目前面臨的最大挑戰。為什麼總統不把它看作最優先考慮的事情呢？

MS. MCENANY: The President is focusing on a lot. Look, the President, just yesterday, held a big press conference, if you will, or an avail in the Opal [sic] — Oval Office about MS-13. COVID is something that we’re focused on. It is a top priority of this administration. It’s why the task force meets. It’s why I had mentioned to you we’re taking all those steps.

答：總統關注的東西很多。昨天總統舉行了一個大型的新聞發佈會，如果你願意的話，或者在橢圓形辦公室利用了一個關於MS-13的資訊。新冠疫情是我們關注的重點。這是本屆政府的首要任務，也是工作組為何開會的原因。這就是為什麼我提到了正在採取的所有步驟。

But there are other things the President has to focus on: namely, Democrat cities not controlling their streets; namely, the mayor of Chicago — people dying in her — in her — on the streets of her city every weekend. And the President sent her a letter saying, “You must secure your city.”

但是總統還需要關注其他方面:即,民主黨城市沒能控制自己的街道;也就是，芝加哥的市長，每個週末，人們都都會在她的城市中喪生。總統給她寄了一封信說：“你必須保衛你的城市。”

The President is involved in Operation LeGend, in honor of LeGend Taliferro, a young man who lost his life; sending federal assistance to St. Louis, a city that has asked for help, and he’s shown up. The President is focused on MS-13, who tragically maimed and killed those two young little girls, and he’s held their killer accountable — the leader of that ring.

總統參加了勒根德行動，以紀念失去生命的年輕人勒根德·塔萊弗羅（LeGend Taliferro），總統現身向請求幫助的聖路易斯市提供了聯邦援助 。總統集中精力在 MS-13，就是那個不幸地致殘並殺害了兩個小女孩的犯罪團夥。總統將兇手—那個團夥的首領—繩之以法。

So, the President is focused on COVID. It’s a top priority. He is focused on the violence in the streets. He’s doing a lot of things at once, and that’s the great thing about the Trump administration.

總統專注于新冠疫情是當務之急。關注街頭暴力。他同時要做很多事情，這也是川普政府的偉大之處。

Yes.

是的。

Q: But just quickly, when is the last time he attended a task force briefing?

問：請問，他最後一次參加工作隊簡介會是什麼時候？

MS. MCENANY: The President is briefed on coronavirus each and every day.

總統每天向記者介紹新冠病毒情況。

Yes, Darlene.

是的，達琳。

Q: Thank you. Does the White House agree that it’s not helpful for people to wait seven days or longer to get the results of their coronavirus test? And is the White House going to do anything to try to shorten those wait times so that people can get their results sooner?

問：謝謝你！白宮是否贊同需要7天甚至更久才能拿到冠狀病毒檢測結果沒有任何説明？白宮是否會採取措施縮短等待時間，以便更快得到測試結果？

MS. MCENANY: So, we’ve done more than any country in the world on testing; there’s no doubt about that — 42 million tests. The country with the next highest number is India at 12 million.

答：好的，我們在測試方面做的比世界上任何國家都多；毫無疑問，4200萬次測試。第二高的國家是印度，有1200萬人。

There are various different types of tests in this country; some take longer to process than others. But we have surged testing to the states, and we encourage them to use it to their best ability and to process those tests as quickly as possible.

我們有各種不同類型的測試，有些需要更長的時間來處理。但我們已經在各州進行了大量的測試，我們鼓勵他們盡其所能儘快處理這些測試。

Yes, Weijia.

是的，維佳。

Q: Hi, Kayleigh. Thank you. To follow up on that: It’s not just about the quantity of testing; it’s about the quality of testing. So is the administration doing anything specifically to make all the tests out there return quicker results — because, you know, a lot of health experts are worried that when people have to wait seven days or longer, they’re out and they’re spreading the disease unknowingly.

問：你好，凱莉，謝謝！接著說：這不僅僅是測試的數量;而是關於測試的品質。那麼川普政府正採取什麼具體措施來更快的獲得檢測結果呢？—你知道，許多衛生專家擔心，當人們不得不等待七天或更長時間的時候，他們就會出門在走，就不知不覺中又傳播了病毒。

MS. MCENANY: So, as I noted, there are several different types of tests. There’s the Abbott rapid response test. There are other tests that take longer. Dr. Birx and Admiral Giroir are constantly out there advising on testing and how to process these tests.

答：如前所述，有幾種不同類型的測試。有雅培快速反應測試。還有其他的測試需要更長的時間。布瑞克斯博士和吉瑞爾上將一直在為測試和如何處理這些測試提出建議。

Ultimately, we can give the states the supplies, but they’ve got to use them in the best way possible to get results as quickly as possible. But rest assured, our team is fully engaged, from Admiral Giroir to Dr. Birx and others.

最後，我們可以為各州提供物資，當然必須以最好的方式使用這些物資來儘快取得測試結果。但請放心，我們團隊從吉瑞爾上將到布瑞克斯博士等人都充滿了敬業精神。

And Admiral Giroir shared with me we have 552 sites testing in America in 48 states and the District of Columbia; 65 percent of these sites are located in counties with moderate to high social vulnerability; and 201 additional sites will be going live this week. And that’s on top of the 1,300 federally qualified health centers that are out there testing as well, and the commercial testing sites at CVS.

吉瑞爾上將告訴我們，在美國48個州有552個地點進行測試包括哥倫比亞特區；其中65%的測試點位於社會脆弱性中等到高的縣；另有201個測試點將在本周上線。除此之外，還有1300個聯邦認證的健康中心也在進行測試，還有設立在CVS的商業測試網站等。

Q: I have another question, Kayleigh.

問：我還有一個問題，凱莉 。

MS. MCENANY: Yes.

答：請講。

Q: In an interview with CBS News, President Trump said, “More white people are killed,” as an answer to why black people are still being killed by police officers. But by population percentages, black people are about three times more likely than white people to die in a police encounter. If the President won’t even acknowledge that, how can he fix the problem?

問：在接受CBS新聞採訪時，川普總統用“更多的白人被殺害”來回答黑人仍然被員警殺害這個問題。 但按人口百分比計算，在與員警的衝突中，黑人死亡的可能性大約是白人的三倍。如果總統連這點都不承認，他怎麼能解決這個問題呢?

MS. MCENANY: The President has routinely acknowledged and expressed the absolute atrocity of the case of George Floyd, and his heart goes out to that family still. He was noting a fact that there were — when you look at unarmed killings with police interactions in this country, that you had 9 unarmed black individuals who were fatally shot and 19 unarmed white individuals. That’s down from 38 and 32, respectively, in 2015. So numbers have actually come down since the Obama administration. He was making that point.

答：總統一貫承認和表達了喬治·佛洛德事件是絕對暴行，他的心一直和那個家庭在一起。但指出了一個事實——當你觀察我們國家的員警之間的非武裝殺人行為時，會 有9名手無寸鐵的黑人和19名手無寸鐵的白人被槍殺。2015年，這一數字分別為38和32。因此，自奧巴馬政府以來，數字實際上已經下降。他就是在說明這一點。

But one point he wants to strongly make is this: that black men and women who die of homicide, they’re likely to die of homicide at eight times greater than that of white individuals and Hispanics combined. That’s the rate combined. So that’s an extraordinary thing that we want to look at.

但他想強調的一點是:死于兇殺案的黑人男性和女性，死于兇殺案的白人和西班牙裔總和 的8倍。這是總比例。這是我們想要研究的一件非同尋常的事情。

I’ve listed for you the names of these kids who have died across this country. It is unacceptable, and under this President, he’ll take action. And the derelict mayor of Chicago should step up and ask for federal help because she’s doing a very poor job at securing her streets.

我已經為你們列出了全國各地死去的孩子們的名字。這是不可接受的，在總統的領導下，他將採取行動。被遺棄的芝加哥市長應該站出來請求聯邦政府的幫助，因為她在保護街道安全方面做得非常糟糕。

Q: I was talking about —

問：我說的是

MS. MCENANY: Yes.

答：是什麼

Q: — people who are dying at the hands of police officers.

問：那些死在員警手中的人

MS. MCENANY: Yes.

答：是的

Q: Is the President considering travel bans for members of the Communist Party to enter the U.S.? And is he concerned about escalation of tensions with China?

**問：總統是否正在考慮對中國共產黨員的旅行禁令呢？他是否擔心與中國的緊張關係升級？**

MS. MCENANY: So I have no announcements on that front, but rest assured we keep every option on the table with regard to China.

**答：在這方面我沒有聲明，但請放心，我們會把有關中國的所有選擇都擺在桌面上來談。**

Q: Has he ruled out any options at all?

**問：他有沒有排除任何選擇?**

MS. MCENANY: He’s not ruled out any options with regard to China.

**答：他不排除關於中國的任何選擇。**

Yes. Jeff.

好的，傑夫

Q: Thanks, Kayleigh. Does the White House have a reaction to the hacking of Twitter last night? And do you have any broader concerns or does the President have any broader concerns about using that platform to issue not only his own opinions, but official policy pronouncements, given its apparent vulnerability to hacking?

問：謝謝，凱裡 。白宮對昨晚推特遭駭客攻擊有何反應？考慮到該平臺顯然容易受到駭客攻擊，您是否對使用該平臺不僅發表自己的觀點，而且發表官方政策聲明，是否有更廣泛的關注？

MS. MCENANY: Yes, so I spoke with Dan Scavino before coming out here — my team did. And Dan has been — and his team and digital have been in constant contact with Twitter over the last 18 hours to keep Twitter secure — the President’s Twitter feed. The President will remain on Twitter, but his account was secure and not jeopardized during these attacks.

答：好的，來這裡之前我和丹.斯卡維諾談過了—我的團隊是這樣做的。在過去的18個小時裡，丹和他的團隊以及數字媒體一直在與推特保持聯繫，以確保推特的安全使用。總統將繼續使用推特，但他的賬戶是安全的，在這些攻擊中沒有受到威脅。

Q: Okay. And just one follow-up to Weijia’s question. I guess I didn’t follow the data that you were just referring to. Are you saying that the President did have data to back up his claim that more white people are killed by police officers than black people?

問：好的。只是魏家問題的一項後續行動。我想我沒有遵循您剛才提到的資料。你是說總統確實有資料支援他的說法，即被員警殺死的白人比黑人多？

MS. MCENANY: Yeah, and I’ve already read out that data to you.

答：是的，我已經把這些資料讀給你了。

Q: I don’t think we followed it. It didn’t —

問：我想我們還沒理解，它沒有——

MS. MCENANY: I’ve already read out that data to you, and you can go fact-check on the Washington Post.

答：是的，我已經把這些資料讀給你了。你可以在《華盛頓郵報》上做事實查證。

Yes.

是的。

Q: Kayleigh, two quick questions. First, Congressman Steve Watkins of Kansas has been charged with three felonies in a voter fraud case. Obviously, the President campaigned with him in 2018, and he’s repeatedly expressed concern with voter fraud. So does he have a reaction to that?

問：凱莉，兩個簡單的問題。 首先，堪薩斯州國會議員史蒂夫·沃特金斯在一起選票造假案中被指控犯有三項重罪。顯然，總統在2018年與他一起競選，他一再對選票造假表示擔憂。那麼他對此如何反應？

MS. MCENANY: That’s the first I’m hearing of that. I haven’t spoken to the President of it. He does have very real concerns about voter fraud, and he’s mentioned several of those. And there’s yet more information that there is rampant voter fraud when you have mass mail-in voting. In 2016, as the President has noted, about 1 percent of absentee ballots nationwide were thrown out, and it could be much higher this year, as many people vote by mail for the first time. That’s one of the flaws with mass mail-in voting.

答：這是我第一次聽說。雖然對此我還沒和總統說過話，但他確實對選票造假有非常的擔憂，他也提到了其中的幾個問題。還有更多消息指出當大規模應用郵寄投票時，選票造假十分猖獗。2016年，正如總統所指出的一樣，全國約有1%的缺席選票被否決，今年可能會高得多，因為許多人第一次通過郵寄投票。這是大規模郵寄投票的缺陷之一。

But beyond that, we’ve seen a number of reports out of New Jersey that found a U.S. Postal Service vehicle that may have been carrying mail-in ballots that were — that was caught on fire, this truck. This was recent. Also, in the New Jersey Star-Ledger, on June 22nd — this was very striking — 500 to 700 Republicans received ballots with all Democrat candidates. They were erroneous mail-in ballots that had been voided and then reissued. And the slate of candidates on these ballots was all Democrat, from Joe Biden down to dogcatcher. And these were supposed to be Republican ballots. Those are three recent examples, and there are many more.

但除此之外，我們從新澤西州看到一些報導，發現一輛可能攜帶郵寄選票的美國郵政局車輛——這輛卡車著火了，這是最近的事。此外，在6月22日的《新澤西星報》上，這真是令人震驚,500到700名共和黨派民眾獲得了只有民主黨候選人的選票。它們是錯誤的，本已作廢的郵寄選票，但被重新發放。這些選票上的候選人名單都是民主黨人，從喬·拜登到追捕者。這些本該是共和黨派的選票。而這只是最近的三個例子，此外還有更多。

Q: Just a quick second question, Kayleigh. When the President made the initial decision to move the Republican National Convention from Charlotte to Florida, he said that it was because the North Carolina governor was in a shutdown mood and that he was playing politics because he didn’t want to pack an indoor stadium to full capacity. He also said that the cost to North Carolinians would be — and I’m quoting the President now — “all of the jobs and the economic development the convention would bring.” So all of that money, all of that time, all of that cost to jobs and economic development to North Carolinians for the same result — right? — because they’re trying to make the convention in Florida — what does the President have to say the North Carolinians?

問：第二個問題，凱莉。當總統做出將共和黨全國代表大會從夏洛特搬到佛羅里達州的最初決定時，他說這是因為北卡羅來納州州長情緒低落，他在玩弄政治，因為他不想把室內體育場安排滿。他還表示，這對北卡羅來納州人的代價將是——我現在引用總統的話——“將會帶來的所有就業機會和經濟發展” 。因此，所有這些錢，時間，工作和經濟發展的代價，帶給北卡羅來納州人的結果都一樣對不對？因為他們試圖在佛羅里達舉行大會——總統有什麼要對北卡羅來納州人說的？

MS. MCENANY: So, the President loves the people of North Carolina, and they’re well aware of that. The President wanted to be able to hold his convention, which is why it was moved to Jacksonville. And for anything further, I’d refer you to the RNC.

答：總統熱愛北卡羅來納州的人民，他們也很清楚這一點。總統希望能夠順利舉行他的大會，這就是為什麼它被轉移到傑克遜維爾。至於任何其他的事情，我會推薦你詢問共和黨全國委員會。

Yes.

是的。

Q: Thank you, Kayleigh. The President has talked about an executive order on immigration coming soon. He’s also talked about protections for DACA recipients. It’s been unclear, though, whether those protections — the path to citizenship that the President talked about — will be included in the executive order. So I was hoping you could clarify: Will the path to citizenship protections for DACA be part of the executive order?

問：謝謝你，凱莉。總統談到了即將就移民問題出臺一項行政命令。他還談到了對《童年入境者暫緩遣返手續》（DACA）受益者的保護。不過，目前還不清楚這些保護——總統談到的入籍途徑——是否會被納入行政命令中。所以我希望你能澄清：《童年入境者暫緩遣返手續》獲得公民權保護的途徑會是行政命令的一部分嗎？

MS. MCENANY: So, what I would say is this: As the President announced, he’s working on an executive order to establish a merit-based immigration system. That will be the intent of the executive order.

答：所以我要說的是正如總統所宣佈的，他正在制定一項行政命令，以建立一個基於功績的移民制度。這將是此次行政命令的目的。

Q: And can I ask a second question? On the schools: The President — the Vice President talked about some of the new guidelines or new pages of documents for CDC coming out this week. Is that still the plan? Are those going to come out this week? Is there any chance that this is being rethought at this time?

問：我可以問第二個問題嗎？關於學校副總統談到了本周發佈的一些新指南或疾控中心（CDC）新文件。現在還是這個計畫嗎？這個星期會公佈出來嗎？ 現在有可能重新考慮這個問題嗎？

MS. MCENANY: So those are CDC guidelines you’re referencing, so I’ll leave it to CDC as to when those guidelines come out. But we really would like to see schools open. As has been clear, we don’t think our children should be locked up at home with devastating consequences when it’s perfectly safe for them to go to school, as emphasized by many medical experts. So the President is very keen on seeing schools reopen. It’s the only thing that’s fair to America’s children.

答：你引用的疾控中心指南，我要留給疾控中心來決定這些指南什麼時候公佈。但是我們真的希望看到學校開放。很明顯，在上學完全安全的情況下，我們認為不應該把孩子關在家裡，這會造成毀滅性的後果，這也是很多醫學專家所強調的。因此，總統非常希望看到學校重新開學。這是唯一對美國孩子公平的事情。

Yes.

是的。

Q: Thanks, Kayleigh. Two quick questions for you. On Wednesday, the CDC director said, quote, “If all of us would put on a face covering now for the next four weeks, six weeks, I think we could drive this epidemic into the ground.” Admiral Giroir has made similar comments. The CDC director called it our, quote, “major defense.” I’m wondering if the President would consider at any point a nationwide mask mandate.

問：謝謝，凱莉。兩個簡單的問題。週三，疾病預防控制中心主任說，“如果我們所有人都能在未來四周、六周內帶上面罩，我想我們可以把這種流行病滅掉”。吉羅奧海軍上將也發表了類似言論。疾控中心主任稱其為”主要防禦”。我想知道總統是否會考慮在任何時刻在全國範圍內實施面罩強制性指令。

MS. MCENANY: Well, the President has said that he would wear a mask if he was in a place where he couldn’t be appropriately social distanced. He did wear a mask this weekend when he visited the hospital. So he has shown that, you know, he’ll wear a mask, and not only that — that he would wear one if he wasn’t socially distanced, as evidenced by his own actions. We leave it to localities to make the decisions with regard to face coverings. And the CDC guidelines remain the same today: “recommended” but not “required.”

答：好，總統說，如果他在一個不能適當保持社交距離的地方，他會戴口罩。這個週末他去醫院時確實戴著面具。因此，他已經表明，如你所知，他會戴口罩，不僅如此——如果他不能維持社交距離，他就會戴上口罩，這一點他用了自己的行動來證明。我們交給地方來決定關於面罩的問題。疾控中心的指導方針至今未變：“推薦”，但不是“必需”。

Q: A quick second question for you. You were saying earlier that the President is very concerned about local officials who are not taking actions about, you know, deaths in your cities. You also said he was appalled by what happened to George Floyd. In March, a 26-year-old black woman named Breonna Taylor was killed while sleeping in her home. The three officers involved in that case in Kentucky have not been arrested or fired. Is the President monitoring that case at all? And does he want to see justice for Breonna Taylor?

問：第二個簡單的問題。你之前說，總統非常關注那些當地官員，他們對自己城市內的死亡無動於衷。你還表示他對喬治 ·佛洛德的遭遇感到驚駭。今年3月，一名名叫布龍娜·泰勒的26歲黑人婦女在家睡覺時被殺。肯塔基州參與該案的三名警官尚未被逮捕或解雇。總統是否在關注這個案子？ 他希望為布里昂娜 · 泰勒伸張正義嗎？

MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I won’t weigh into that other than to say I’d refer you to the DOJ, who takes federal action where necessary, where the facts merit. But our hearts grieve for Breonna Taylor’s family.

答：嗯，對此我不想多說，除此我會把你介紹給司法部，如果事實需要的話，聯邦會採取行動。但我們由衷為布勞娜·泰勒的家人感到悲傷。

Q: Thank you.

問：謝謝。

MS. MCENANY: Lalit.

答：拉利特。

Q: Thank you. Another question on China. President Trump is the only U.S. President to have stood strong against China, which is of great comfort to countries like India and his other allies in the Asian neighborhood. Does he have a message to China on this? And has he spoken with China and other countries on how to collaborate against (inaudible)?

問：謝謝。另一個關於中國的問題。川普總統是僅有的一位對中國採取強硬行動的美國總統，這讓印度和其他亞洲鄰國的盟友感到十分欣慰。他在這方面有什麼給中國的表示嗎？ 他與中國和其他國家是否談過如何合作對付…？

MS. MCENANY: Thank you, Lalit. I did see your question earlier, and I brought it to the President, and he said, “I love the people of India, and I love the people of China, and I want to do everything possible to keep the peace for the people.” Thank you.

答：謝謝你，拉利特。我之前確實看到你的問題，並把它帶給了總統，他說，“我熱愛印度人民，我也熱愛中國人民，我想盡一切可能為人民維護和平”。謝謝。

Q: Yes, two — a question that flows from two events that we saw recently that we wouldn’t have seen in previous White Houses. The first was the campaign meeting in the Cabinet Room last month, and then the political speech in the Rose Garden this week. Can you talk about your understanding of what the White House policy is for this White House, as far as politics? Is there any place in the White House where you think politics is inappropriate? And where do you — where do you draw the line?

問：兩個問題，它源於我們最近看到的兩個事件，是在以前的白宮中我們都看不到的。第一次是上個月在內閣會議室舉行的競選會議，然後是本周在玫瑰園舉行的政治演講。你能否談談以你的理解，就政治而言，白宮的政策是什麼？你認為在白宮有不合適政治的地方嗎？ 你會在哪裡劃分界限？

MS. MCENANY: We act in accordance with the Hatch Act. It’s well established that the President and Vice President are not subject to the Hatch Act. It says this much in the Hatch Act. It says that the Hatch Act applies to executive branch employees, which is defined in the Hatch Act as “employee,” meaning any individual other than the President and the Vice President.

答：我們按照《哈奇法案》（Hatch Act）行事。眾所周知，總統和副總統不受《哈奇法案》的限制，在《哈奇法案》中也如此說明。根據它，《哈奇法案》應用于行政部門雇員，在《哈奇法案》中，該雇員被定義為“雇員”，即除總統和副總統以外的任何個人。

So his speech in the Rose Garden was entirely —

所以他在玫瑰園的演講完全是——

Q: That’s not my question. The Hatch Act has nothing to do with it.

問：這不是我的問題。 《哈奇法案》與它沒有任何關係。

MS. MCENANY: — appropriate.

答：——適當。

Owen.

歐文。

Q: The Hatch Act has nothing to do with this, though.

問：不過，《哈奇法案》與這事沒有任何關係。

MS. MCENANY: What? It has everything to do with this. Go read the Hatch Act. That’s what you’re alleging that is problematic with the President.

答：什麼？這與它當然有關係。 去讀《哈奇法案》。這就是你所指控總統的問題所在。

Q: Well, no, I’m just — I’m stating no —

問：好吧，不，我只是——我只是在說明不——

MS. MCENANY: But what your real problem was, was the fact that the President gave a very good, powerful speech from the Rose Garden.

答：但你真正的困擾是，總統在玫瑰園發表了一篇非常有力的演講。

Owen.

歐文。

Q: Well, you talked about earlier, with school districts — what we’re seeing is more school districts — at least in Virginia, for example, last night — deciding to go online only. What does the President say to parents out there who are now going, “Okay, what do I do with my kids?”

問：嗯，你之前談到過學區——我們看到的是更多的學區——至少在維吉尼亞，例如昨晚——決定只供網上學習。總統對那些現在正在想：“好吧，我該怎麼處理我的孩子？”的父母說什麼？

MS. MCENANY: You know, the President has said unmistakably that he wants schools to open. And I was just in the Oval talking to him about that. And when he says open, he means open in full — kids being able to attend each and every day at their school. The science should not stand in the way of this. And as Dr. Scott Atlas said — I thought this was a good quote — “Of course, we can [do it]. Everyone else in the…Western world, our peer nations are doing it. We are the outlier here.” The science is very clear on this, that — you know, for instance, you look at the JAMA Pediatrics study of 46 pediatric hospitals in North America that said the risk of critical illness from COVID is far less for children than that of seasonal flu.

答：你知道，總統已經毫無疑問地表示，他希望學校開放。我剛在總統辦公室和他談這個。當他說開放時，他的意思是全面開放——孩子們每天都能在學校上學。科學不應該阻擋這一點。正如斯科特·阿特拉斯博士說的——我認為這是一句好名言——“當然，我們能做到。西方世界的其他國家，我們的鄰國都在這樣做。唯獨我們例外。”科學在這一點上非常明確，例如，你看《美國醫學會兒科雜誌》（JAMA Pediatrics）上對北美46家兒科醫院的研究，該研究稱，來自新冠對兒童的危重病風險遠遠低於季節性流感。

The science is on our side here, and we encourage for localities and states to just simply follow the science, open our schools. It’s very damaging to our children: There is a lack of reporting of abuse; there’s mental depressions that are not addressed; suicidal ideations that are not addressed when students are not in school. Our schools are extremely important, they’re essential, and they must reopen.

科學站在了我們這邊，我們鼓勵地方和州政府遵循科學，開放我們的學校。當學生不在學校時，這對我們的孩子非常有害：缺乏虐待行為的舉報；精神抑鬱無法得到解決；自殺傾向無法得到解決。我們的學校是極其重要的，它們是必不可少的，它們必須重新開放。

Yes.

是的。

Q: Thanks, Kayleigh. The U.S., Canada, and the UK today accused Russia of trying to hack coronavirus research — vaccine research. I was wondering if the President has a response to Russia for that.

問：謝謝，凱莉。美國、加拿大和英國今天指責俄羅斯試圖駭客入侵冠狀病毒的疫苗研究。我想知道對此總統是否對俄羅斯有所回應。

MS. MCENANY: Yeah, so the one thing I would say about that — and it was made — it was announced earlier today — is that we work very closely with our allies to ensure that we would take measures to keep that information safe, and we continue to do so, and we’re aware of those activities.

答：是的，因此，我要說的一件事是，今天早些時候宣佈的，我們與我們的盟友緊密合作，我們會採取措施以確保資訊安全，我們將繼續這麼做，我們也知道這些行為。

Yes, Chanel.

是的，香奈兒

Q: Thanks, Kayleigh. On the CDC — on the movement of data going straight from CDC to HHS now: Understanding that HHS needs access to real-time data, was there also any concern whatsoever undergirding this decision regarding CDC’s possible manipulation of data? There was some reports coming out of Florida — certain states were coming out and saying mid-level CDC reports were not necessarily accurate. And so was that — did that have any effect in this decision to send data straight to HHS?

問：關於資料從疾控中心（CDC）直接轉移到美國衛生與公眾服務部（HHS）的問題：我們理解衛生與公眾服務部需要訪問即時資料，那麼在這個決定的背後，是否也有對疾控中心可能操縱資料的擔憂呢？有一些來自佛羅里達州的報告——某些州出來說中期疾控中心報告不一定準確。那麼這對直接向美國衛生與公眾服務部發送資料的決定有什麼影響嗎？

MS. MCENANY: No, the intent for this decision — and I talked extensively today with Dr. Birx, with Secretary Azar, and with Dr. Redfield about this. The intent of this is: We need to make sure that there is daily data that is being given to Dr. Birx and others who are running point on a lot of our actions with remdesivir and identifying hotspots.

答：不，這個決定的目的——今天，我與伯克斯（Birx）博士、阿紮爾部長和雷德菲爾德博士廣泛討論了這個問題。這個決定的目的是：我們需要確保每天都有資料提供給伯克斯博士和其他正在為瑞德西韋和識別熱點相關措施奔波的人。

And I would point out — and I just want to explain this because I think there’s been some confusion in the press — that there are two methods of data collection. One is the National Healthcare Safety Network, and this is a CDC system. And this is where hospitals voluntarily report their data, and about 81 percent of hospitals were reporting their data. So we don’t need 81 percent of hospitals reporting data; we need 100 percent of hospitals reporting data because it is critical that Dr. Birx and others receive the daily admissions, ICU use, and PPE numbers. And when you’re only getting 81 percent of hospital data, that means you’ve got 19 percent of hospitals that were unaware of their needs.

我要指出——我只是想解釋一下，因為我認為媒體上存在一些困惑——有兩種資料收集方法。一個是國家健康照護安全網路（NHSN），這是一個疾控中心的系統。而這也是醫院自願上報資料的地方，約81%的醫院在此上報資料。但我們不需要 81%的醫院報告資料，我們需要 100%的醫院報告資料，因為伯克斯博士和其他人必須獲得每日入院、重症監護室使用和個人防護裝備的數位。當你只獲得 81%的醫院資料時，這意味著你不知道19%醫院的需求。

So what happened is we also have a second method of using — of tracking this data, and it’s the TeleTracker database, and this is an HHS system. And this was initially used for purposes of provider relief funding, and we asked hospitals to tell us about their COVID admissions so that we could identify possible hotspots.

因此，我們還有第二個方法使用和跟蹤這些資料，它是遠端跟蹤（TeleTracker）資料庫，這是一個衛生與公眾服務部的系統。而這最初是用於供應商救濟資金的目的，我們要求醫院告訴我們他們的新冠患者入院情況，以便我們確定可能的熱點。

And as it turns out, this data ended up being more complete, more up-to-date with information. And so, ensuring that hospitals are reporting into this system, where we’re getting more complete data, was the reason that HHS has had this transition where they’ve asked hospitals to transition reporting to the TeleTractor [sic] — TeleTracker system. It’s important, especially with remdesivir distribution, that we know exactly where the needs are so we can surge them. So this —

而事實證明，這些資料最終更加完整，資訊更加及時。因此，確保醫院向這個系統彙報，讓我們得以獲得更完整的資料，是衛生與公眾服務部有這種轉變的原因，他們要求醫院將彙報過渡到遠端跟蹤系統。重要的是，尤其是在瑞德西韋的分銷方面，我們要準確地知道需求在哪裡，這樣我們才能激增供應。所以——

Q: And the CDC will still have access to this data (inaudible)?

問：疾控中心仍然可以訪問這些資料？

MS. MCENANY: Yes, that’s right. So, I did confirm that with Dr. Redfield, that this is completely open-source data available to the CDC. Secretary Azar says we insist that they use it. And no one — and Dr. Redfield confirmed this — no one is taking access or data away from the CDC. And that data is routinely published so that the American people are fully informed.

答：是的，沒錯。因此，我確實與雷德菲爾德博士確認，這是完全開源的資料，提供給疾控中心。阿紮爾部長說，我們極力堅持（疾控中心）使用它。而且沒有人——雷德菲爾德博士證實了這一點——沒有人能奪取疾控中心的訪問權或資料。這些資料是定期公佈的，以便美國人民充分瞭解情況。

Yes.

是的。

Q: So, I wanted to follow on that, briefly. There’s been some complaints, particularly among independent modelers who are using the CDC data that was updated daily to, sort of, put out their public model — some of which the White House has relied on — that now those dashboards have been taken down. So I’m wondering if the administration would, sort of, commit to making the broader database a bit more available to the public.

問：所以，我想簡單地跟進一下。有一些抱怨，特別是在獨立建模者中，他們使用每天更新的疾控中心資料，以公佈他們的公共模型——其中一些是白宮所依賴的——現在這些面板已被關閉。因此，我想知道，政府是否會承諾讓更廣泛的資料庫向公眾開放。

MS. MCENANY: The CDC database is the public data that’s been out there. It’ll continue to be public. It should be public. And this is all about getting more data out there, not less data, and ensuring, in particular, that our doctors get that daily data.

答：疾控中心資料庫是公開資料。它將繼續公開。應當是公開的。這一切都是為了獲得更多的資料，而不是更少的資料，特別是確保我們的醫生獲得這些每日資料。

MS. MCENANY: And one thing that I’d also like to point out for everyone is just, with regard to testing, we’ve done more than 42 million tests, as I noted. The second-highest number is 12 million from India. We’re leading the world in testing. And it’s a very stark contrast — and the President mentioned this yesterday, so I just wanted to put some — some additional information out there. It’s actually CBS reporting that, in 2009, under Obama-Biden, quote — and this is CBS reporting — “CDC abruptly advised states to stop testing for H1N1 flu, and stopped counting individual cases.”

我還想為大家指出一件事，就是在測試方面，我們已經做了4200多萬次測試，正如我所指出的。第二高的數字來自印度，為1200萬。我們在測試方面領先世界。這是一個非常鮮明的對比——總統昨天提到了這一點，所以我只想提出一些額外的資訊。實際上，在2009年，奧巴馬-拜登執政期間，引自哥倫比亞廣播公司（CBS）報導：“疾控中心突然建議各州停止對甲型H1N1流感的檢測，並停止計算個別病例”。

So, while this President surged testing, under the Obama administration, they stopped testing entirely. And Ron Klain, Vice President Biden’s former Chief of Staff said this: It is “purely a fortuity that [H1N1] isn’t one of the great mass casualty events in American history. It had nothing to do with us doing anything right.” This is former VP Biden’s Chief of Staff. “It just had to do with luck.”

因此，相比我們這位總統猛增檢測，在奧巴馬政府執政期間，他們完全停止了檢測。而美國副總統拜登的前參謀長隆·克萊恩曾說： “（H1N1）沒有成為美國歷史上的大規模傷亡事件純粹是一個偶然。這與我們做的任何對策都沒有關係” 。這是前副總統拜登的參謀長。 “只是運氣好而已” 。

Contrary to that, this President led the world in testing; led the world in ventilators — redistributing ventilators for therapeutics; 13 vaccine candidates — one going into phase three clinical trial. This response has been extraordinary and historic. We didn’t pause testing; the Obama-Biden administration did, and that was a shameful decision.

與此相反，我們這位總統在檢測上引領世界；在呼吸機製造上引領世界——治療用呼吸機的重新分配；13種候選疫苗——其中一種進入第三階段臨床試驗。這種反應是不同凡響的，具有歷史意義的。我們沒有暫停測試，而奧巴馬-拜登政府暫停了，這是一個可恥的決定。

Thank you.

謝謝。
