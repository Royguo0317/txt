## Executive Summary – The Art of the Steal

## 执行摘要 – 盗窃的艺术

The Democrat Party and its political operatives, with the unwitting aid of “useful idiots” from the Republican Party, stole the presidential election from Donald J. Trump.

在共和党“有用的白痴”的无知帮助下，民主党及其政治代理人从唐纳德·J·川普那里偷走了总统大选。

The Democrat Party used a two-pronged Grand “Stuff the Ballot Box” Strategy to flood six key battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin – with enough illegal absentee and mail-in ballots to turn a decisive Trump victory into a narrow and illegitimate Biden alleged “win.”

民主党实施了双管齐下的“塞满投票箱”大战略，用足够多的非法缺席选票和邮寄选票，充斥了亚利桑那、佐治亚、密西根、内华达、宾夕法尼亚和威斯康星这六个主要战场州，将川普的决定性胜利变成了拜登的微弱的非法的所谓“胜利”。

Prong One dramatically INCREASED the amount of absentee and mail-in ballots in the battleground states. Prong Two dramatically DECREASED the level of scrutiny of such ballots – effectively taking the election “cops” off the beat. This pincer movement resulted in a FLOOD of illegal ballots into the battleground states more than sufficient to tip the scales from a decisive legal win by President Trump to a narrow and illegitimate alleged “victory” by Joe Biden.

一方面大大增加了在战场州的缺席选票和邮寄选票的数量。另一方面大大降低了此类选票的审查水平-有效地摆脱了选举“警察”的束缚。这种钳形攻势导致大量的非法选票涌入战场州，足够将川普总统的决定性的合法的胜利转化为乔·拜登的微弱的非法的所谓“胜利”。

The Democrat Party relied primarily on legal means such as legislative and rule changes at the state level to implement its Grand Strategy and thereby achieve its illegal outcome. However, at times, political operatives advancing the Democrat Party’s Grand Strategy also bent, and sometimes broke, the laws and rules of that which is most sacred to our American public – our election system.

民主党主要依靠法律手段-例如州一级的立法和规则变更-来实施其大战略，从而实现其非法选举结果。但是，有时，推进民主党大战略的政治代理人也会歪曲，有时甚至破坏我们美国公众最神圣的法律和规则-我们的选举制度。

Key methods used by the Democrat Party to strategically game America’s presidential election included changes in the law approved by State Legislatures; rule changes and new guidance initiated by Secretaries of State or other election officials; court rulings and interventions; and the aggressive use of so-called “public-private partnerships” to commandeer and manipulate the election process in key Democrat strongholds such as Wayne County, Michigan and Dane County, Wisconsin.

民主党在战略上玩弄美国总统大选的重要方法包括：修改州议会通过的法律；州务卿或其他选举官员发起的规则变更和新指南；法院裁决和干预；以及积极利用所谓的“公私合营”来控制和操纵民主党重要据点的选举过程，例如在密西根州韦恩县和威斯康星州丹恩县。

Prong One of the Democrat Party’s Grand Strategy used seven basic gambits to dramatically INCREASE the flood of absentee and mail-in ballots: relaxing mail-in and absentee ballot rules; sending absentee or mail-in ballots or applications for such ballots to every voter (universal mailing); increasing both the legal and illegal use of drop boxes; ballot harvesting; and the use of corrupted voting machines.

民主党大战略的一手是用七个基本招数来显著提高缺席选票和邮寄选票的泛滥程度：放松邮寄选票和缺席选票的规则；向每个选民发送缺席选票或邮寄选票或此类选票的申请（通用邮寄）；增加合法和非法投票箱的使用；选票收集；使用有缺陷的投票机。

Prong Two of the Democrat Party’s Grand Strategy used five additional gambits to dramatically DECREASE the level of scrutiny of the new flood of absentee and mail-in ballots into the battleground states: relaxation of ID verification; reduced signature matching requirements; illegally counting naked ballots to increase ballot curing – both legal and illegal; and reduced poll watching and observing.

民主党大战略的另一手用额外的五个策略，大大降低了对新涌入战场州的缺席选票与邮寄选票的审查水平。这五招是：放松身份验证；降低签名匹配要求；非法盘点合法及非法的裸票以增加选票的矫正率；减少投票监督和观察。

Democrat Party operatives frequently hid behind the shield of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus and resultant pandemic to further their goals of boosting the absentee and mail-in ballot counts in the key battleground states.

民主党代理人常常以CCP病毒及其导致的大流行病为掩护，进一步实现他们在关键战场州增加缺席选票和邮寄选票数量的目标。

The practical result of the Democrat Party’s two-pronged Grand “Stuff the Ballot Box” Strategy was to flood the six key battleground states with enough illegal absentee and mail-in ballots to turn a decisive Trump victory into a narrow alleged Biden “victory.” Key political operatives assisting the Democrat Party included Wall Street oligarch George Soros, Silicon Valley oligarch and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Marc Elias, former Hillary Clinton Campaign General Counsel and one of the alleged architects and financial conduits for Fusion GPS and the Russia Hoax designed to topple a duly-elected President.

民主党的双管齐下的“塞满选票箱”大战略的实际结果是，向六个主要战场州倾入足够的非法缺席选票和邮寄选票，以将川普的决定性胜利转变为拜登的微弱“胜利”。 协助民主党的主要政治代理人包括华尔街寡头乔治·索罗斯（George Soros），硅谷寡头和脸书首席执行官马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg），以及马克·埃里亚斯（Marc Elias）。马克·埃利亚斯是前希拉里·克林顿竞选总顾问，以及用于推翻合法当选总统的Fusion GPS和Russia Hoax的设计者和财务渠道之一。

Soros money helped fund efforts to change election laws and rules through instruments such as referenda. Soros and his network of organizations such as the political action committee “Secretary of State Project” also helped to elect puppet Secretaries of State in Michigan (Jocelyn Benson) and Pennsylvania (Kathy Boockvar) who would play instrumental roles in bending or breaking election rules and thereby advancing the Grand “Stuff the Ballot Box” Strategy. Zuckerberg money – nearly half a billion dollars – helped engineer what was effectively a hostile Democrat Party “public- private partnership” takeover of what should otherwise be a nonpartisan election process in key Democrat strongholds such as Wayne County, Michigan and Dane County, Wisconsin.

索罗斯（Soros）的资金通过公投等手段来资助改变选举的法律法规。索罗斯及其组织网络，例如政治行动委员会“州务卿项目”，还帮助选举了密西根州傀儡州务卿乔斯林·本森 (Jocelyn Benson) 和宾夕法尼亚州傀儡州务卿凯西·波克瓦尔（Kathy Boockvar）。他们在歪曲或违反选举规则， 进而推进“塞满投票箱”大战略方面都发挥了重要作用。扎克伯格将近5亿美元的资金有效地策划了一场敌队的民主党“公私合营”，这本来应该是密西根州韦恩县和威斯康星州戴恩县等民主党主要据点的无党派选举程序。

Useful idiots for the Democrat Party included Georgia’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp and Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who entered into a Consent Decree that dramatically INCREASED the number of absentee and mail-in ballots while dramatically DECREASING the rejection rate of such ballots. Republican state legislators who voted for the bills that would help the Democrats advance its Grand Strategy likewise were unwitting dupes.

对民主党有用的白痴包括佐治亚州的共和党州长布莱恩·坎普（Brian Kemp)和共和党州务卿布拉德·拉芬斯佩格(Brad Raffensperger)，他们签署了一项同意书，大大增加了缺席选票和邮寄选票的数量，同时戏剧性地降低了此类选票的拒绝率。那些投票支持有助于民主党推进其大战略法案的共和党州议员，同样是不知情的骗子。

By implementing its Grand “Stuff the Ballot Box” Strategy, the Democrat Party and its political operatives have strategically gamed one of the most sacred elements of American democracy, our election system. This was brass knuckle politics played at the highest level which has delivered a brutal punch to the nose of the American people and a vicious kick to the groin of American democracy.

通过实施其“塞满选票箱”大战略，民主党及其政治代理人从战略上玩弄了美国民主制度中最神圣的要素之一，即我们的选举制度。这是在最高级别玩弄的铜指政治，它凶残地打在美国人民的鼻子上，恶毒地踢在美国民主制度的腹股沟上。

That the Democrat Party and its operatives have, up to this point, gotten away with their Immaculate Deception and Art of the Steal, represents a signal failure of the media, Republican state legislators, other Republican government officials across the battleground states, the US Congress, and our judicial branch of government at both the state and federal levels.

到这一刻，民主党及其代理人已经摆脱了他们的“完美的欺骗”和“偷窃艺术”。这代表着媒体，共和党的州一级立法者，战场州的其他共和党政府官员，美国国会，以及州和联邦一级的政府司法部门的完全失败。

Volumes 1 and 2 of the Navarro Report – The Immaculate Deception and The Art of the Steal – together make the strong case for a full investigation of the election irregularities and strategic gaming of our political process that in all likelihood have led to a stolen presidential election. Any such investigation must begin immediately as this nation simply cannot risk the inauguration of a president who will be perceived by a large segment of the American people as illegitimate.

纳瓦罗报告的第1卷和第2卷-“完美的骗局”和“盗窃的艺术“-一起为全面调查选举违规行为和对我们政治程序的战略玩弄提供了充分的论据，这很可能导致了总统大选被盗。任何此类调查都必须立即开始，因为这个国家不能冒险让一个被美国大部分人视为非法的总统宣誓就职。
