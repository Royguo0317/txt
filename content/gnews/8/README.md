新闻简述：在2021年2月15日的第一次Getter视频中，郭先生爆光中共白手套马云和中共打手傅政华的下场，并奉劝中国的私人企业家们：“你们动动脑子吧，醒醒来吧！”

**中国的私人企业家们，你们动动脑子吧，醒醒吧！**

**Chinese Private Entrepreneurs, Use Your Brains, Wake up!**

昨天晚上醒来其中一次，原来代表马云的香港某律师给我打电话，吓我一大跳。一打电话说：“郭先生啊，不要再提马云了，Jack了。”我说，啥意思啊？我说这大过年的，啥意思啊？他说就是因为你们爆料革命老说马云，结果中纪委还有国家安全委员会，让马云坐出来，背后拿枪顶着坐在椅背上，在双规的地点面对摄像机，所谓的出来露了露面。他说不要再搞了，不要再提了。我说我没心情提 Jack 马，我说头两天有一个马云的前女友，因为给他生了个孩子，我原来说过，帮助他照顾的就是我一个哥们，找不着人了，说家里的钱房租都没人付，找我来了。我给你给我说啥？马云的事，我怎么会知道啊？

Last night I was woken up by a phone call from a Hong Kong lawyer who previously represented Jack Ma, which scared me. He said in the call, “Mr. Guo, don’t mention Jack Ma again.” “What do you mean?” I said, “What do you mean by calling me during the Chinese New Year?” He said that it was because our Whistleblower Movement always broke the news about Jack Ma. As a result, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Security Committee forced Jack Ma to sit on a chair facing a camera with a gun behind his back in a “double designation” (also known as “Shuanggui”) location. It’s called a public appearance. He said, “Don’t mention him anymore.” I said that I was not in the mood for mentioning Jack Ma. I said, a couple days ago, a buddy of mine who was taking care of a Jack Ma’s ex-girlfriend who had a child with Jack contacted me, for there was no one paying her rent anymore. I said, “Why do you tell me? How am I supposed to know anything about Jack Ma?”

所以你说共产党让马云出来，让马云的钱连一个房租都付不上，给小女情人的。这抢钱，共产党是天下第一啊。抢了14亿中国人的钱，抢了14亿中国人的未来，就马云这号人连房租现在都不给人家留。所以中国的私人企业家们，你们动动脑子吧，醒醒来吧。

So you tell me. The Communist Party asked Jack Ma to make a public appearance and left him not enough money to pay the rent for his little lover. The CCP is the number one in the world in robbing people’s money! It robbed money from the 1.4 billion Chinese people and also the future of the 1.4 billion people, and didn’t even leave money to someone like Jack Ma to pay the rent. So Chinese private entrepreneurs, use your brains, wake up!

然后更重要的事情，我昨天无意中说了傅政华全家被抓的事。昨天中间两个电话给我打过来：“你看，你说傅政华干嘛？原来有默契的嘛，傅政华不说你，你不说傅政华，傅政华永远不再对你有任何敌意，大家已经坚守了两年了，你干嘛这样啊？”

Then more importantly, I accidentally disclosed yesterday about the arrest of Fu Zhenghua’s whole family. I received two calls yesterday in the middle [of the broadcast], “Look, why did you talk about Fu Zhenghua? There was an agreement that Fu Zhenghua won’t talk about you, and you won’t talk about Fu Zhenghua, and Fu Zhenghua will never have any hostility to you again. Both of you were holding on to that agreement for two years. Why did you do this to him?”

他说昨天傅政华，这个政法委领导、中纪委领导，听说抓傅政华全都是军队抓的，说要求傅政华出来逛一逛，得露露面，为什么？要保持中央绝对权威，啥叫绝对权威啊？傅政华当年把他抓很多人、杀很多人、冤枉很多人，就这个人不能抓，抓了以后就是没人给你共产党干黑活了，所以说咬人的狗还是当人面得给点狗骨头，那怎么当着人面杀这个狗哪？疯狗哪？咬人的狗哪？不行。说傅政华出来转一转。能不能文贵不再说傅政华的事了？

He said that yesterday the leaders of the Political and Legal Affairs Commission and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission (I heard that all the arrests of Fu Zhenghua [and his family] were done by the military) asked Fu Zhenghua to go out and show his face a little bit. Why? To maintain the absolute authority of the central government. What is absolute authority? Fu Zhenghua arrested a lot of people, killed a lot of people, and wronged a lot of people back then. So this person could not be arrested because if you arrest him, no one would do dirty work for you, the CCP. Therefore, a dog that bites people should be given bones in front others. How can you kill this dog in front of people? So, don’t kill a mad dog who bites people for you. So, Fu Zhenghua came out just for a walk. “So, Miles, can you stop talking about Fu Zhenghua?”

兄弟姐妹们，咱这爆料革命啊，愣把海航王健给说死了，愣把海航的说破产了，愣把孙立军给说进去了，吴征现在也完球蛋了，杨澜估计钥匙也找不着了，现在目前能活口的只有一个王岐山了，所以这个爆料革命。

So, brothers and sisters-in-arms, our Whistleblower Movement has “talked” HNA’s Wang Jian to death, “talked” HNA to bankruptcy, and “talked” Sun Lijun to jail. Bruno Wu is also almost done. I guess that Yang Lan can’t play “find the key” game anymore. Now, there is only one who is still alive – Wang Qishan. So this Whistleblower [is really something].
