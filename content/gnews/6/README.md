視頻重點

1. 面對閆博士論文聚焦的疫情焦點，為中共站台的石正麗不得不說CCP病毒暫未有中間宿主，繼續極力掩蓋生化武器的事實。
2. 18日加國外長商鵬飛接受采訪時表示，加拿大和中共國間的自由貿易談判已經走到盡頭，不值得再繼續推進。
3. 中共強行徵兵，江西男生徐文魁因拒服兵役被懲罰：” 3年內不得經商，2年內不得入學、升學。”
4. （史蒂夫·班農, 9/18）推特暫停了閆博士的賬號，對吧？然後Facebook他們禁掉了Tucker（採訪閆博士的）節目。Tucker的節目在國際上炸了鍋。他們禁掉了這個節目。然而他們卻允許所有五毛大軍、《環球時報》以及中共的整個官方機構全面攻擊閆博士。
5. （9/19）剛剛得知消息，美國政府要有行動，特別是現在美國的法律系統，已經做出了重大決定。可能我希望會把香港政府的官員成為很快絞刑架上的人，全球獵殺。直接就把你定義為恐怖組織。


1. When facing Dr. Yan’s report that caught the attention of the world, Shi Zhengli, a scientist siding with the CCP have to said that the intermediate host of the CCP virus hasn’t been found. Shi Zhengli is still trying hard to cover up the truth that it is a biological weapon.
2. On the 18th, Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne said free trade negotiation between Canada and Communist China had come to an end. There is no need to continue.
3. The CCP is forcibly conscripting troops. A Jiangxi boy Xu Wenkui who refused to perform the military service got punished: “He is not allowed to do business within 3 years, and not to be enrolled by schools/universities or to continue study within two years.”
4. (Steve Bannon, 9/18) They pulled down her (Dr. Li-meng Yan) Twitter account, right? They then stopped the whole Facebook thing, Tucker show’s blowing up internationally. They took that down. But they allow the full beatdown of Dr. Yan by all the Wu Mao, 50-Cent Army and the Global Times and the entire official apparatus of the Chinese Communist Party.
5. (9/19) I just received the message that the U.S. government will take actions. The U.S. judicial system in particular have made a major decision. Possibly, I hope very soon, those Hong Kong government officials will “face the gallows” and be hunted around the world. They will be designated as terrorist organization.
