新闻简述：在2021年2月27日的盖特视频中，郭先生揭露中共在香港和中国大陆限制货币兑换和流通，因为“擀面杖”经济一触即崩。另外，中共的邪恶已经败露和震惊了世界和美国，接下来大家会看到全世界的力量集结在一起以毒灭共、以钱灭共。

**香港和大陆经济是****“****擀面杖****”****，美国保守派大会只谈中共盗窃美国大选和病毒**

**Hong Kong and Mainland China’s Economies Are Fake; the Stolen Election and the Virus Are the Focus of the CPAC**

**2:02-3:05**

我接着说，香港这块儿的经济。兄弟姐妹们，到了什么程度了啦！香港的银行，限换，你换港币也受限制，港币换美元也受限制，换什么汇都受限制。说白了就限制你流通。

Let me continue my take on Hong Kong’s economy. How far has Hong Kong’s economy fallen, brothers and sisters? Hong Kong’s banks restrict currency exchange – both on exchanging the US dollars for Hong Kong dollars and exchanging Hong Kong dollars for US dollars! To put it bluntly, this is circulation control!

大陆，只要是你大额交易，买进卖出股票，都有人可能找你。就是让你不流通，就[像]在那儿杵一[个]擀面杖子，既不能碰，也不能动。这个叫擀面杖子，既不能碰，还不能动！现在这国内银行，拿美金现金到银行换人民币，大家去了解了解，都不让你换。你给他美金它也不让你换，你拿人民币换美金就更不让你换啦！不让你动，不让你流通，因为你一流通这就假啦！你说我这捧着个假东西在那儿搁着，你既不能让它动，也不能让别人碰，一碰就假了嘛！

In mainland China, if you engage in large transactions or buy or sell stocks, you will be questioned. The purpose is to restrict circulations because the economy is a “rolling pin” economy (meaning the economy is fake) and this “rolling pin” cannot be touched or moved! Now in the banks in mainland China, if you bring U.S. dollars there to exchange for RMB, they will not change it for you. You can verify this yourself. Even if you give them dollars for yuan, the bank won’t do it for you. If you give them RMB for USD, of course they won’t change it for you. The currency cannot be freely exchanged because it would be revealed that the economy is fake once free circulation is allowed. Imagine a person holding fake investments not being allowed to touch or sell them. Once it’s touched, everyone will know it’s fake.

**4:51-6:02**

然后现在是，听说，江、曾、孟、韩、上海帮、江浙帮儿，所谓的老政治局，老人帮儿，都在说了，澳大利亚、英国，包括俄罗斯，除了现在懦弱的日本之外，那就美国、加拿大，那就不用说了西方世界，新西兰，都在通过外交渠道告诉中国：“种族大屠杀的事情，你们要做好准备，我们和你们的来往方式要改变。”同时告诉他们：“病毒真相不搞清楚，我们之间所谓两国的正常关系，是不可能进行下去的。”

It is said that Jiang Zemin, Zeng Qinghong, Meng Jianzhu, and Han Zheng, the “Shanghai Gang” or the “Jiangsu and Zhejiang Gang”, the former Standing Committee members of the Central Politburo, and the “original revolutionary gang” are all talking about how Australia, the UK, Russia, the US, Canada, New Zealand, all the Western countries, except cowardly Japan, are telling the CCP, through diplomatic channels, that “Because of the genocide, you must be prepared for a change in the way how we deal with you.” At the same time they’ve told the CCP, “It is impossible to carry on the so-called ‘normal relations’ between us until the truth about the virus is clarified!”

香港事情，这些国家现在越来越明确。香港事情如果再这样继续下去，那西方会形成一个联盟，因为你已经完全没法儿跟你打交道了。关键是，兄弟姐妹们，它最核心的，如果一旦是种族大屠杀、反人类罪和病毒，追究责任和香港事件，纠集在一起的时候，共产党就马上是一个全人类的公敌，非法政权。

These countries’ attitudes towards what happened in Hong Kong has become clearer, and the West will unite against the CCP because there is no way for them to interact with the CCP anymore! Brothers and sisters, the key is that once the genocide, the crimes against humanity, and the truth about the virus are confirmed, and once they are held accountable for those things and the Hong Kong crisis, the CCP will immediately become a public enemy of the whole humanity and an illegitimate regime!

**7:00-9:35**

然后大家要看到，世界上现在的，所有的经济都在兑水，印钞票的时候，中共国的人民币，现在是非常的硬，很硬。为什么要那么硬？他不敢，也绝对无能力把人民币的真正对外的汇价让它放开。或者说，但凡让它贬值，超过7.5，瞬间的效应会让人民币一文不值。中国人相信硬的，不相信真的！人民币硬挺，他以为我人民币值钱，但凡一贬，全部都大撒把，大撒把就是失控啦。

Then, you should know that while all the markets in the world inflate and their currencies devalue due to excess currency issuance, the CCP’s RMB is still holding strong, very strong. Why? Because the CCP doesn’t dare, and definitely does not have the ability, to allow the foreign exchange rate of the RMB to float freely. Or in other words, once the the exchange rate with the US dollar is allowed to exceed 7.5, the RMB will instantly become worthless. The Chinese people believe in stability (fake strength), but not the truth. When people see that the RMB is strong, they think it has value. Once the RMB is devalued, the whole economy will be out of control.

共产党是真邪恶！ 用昨天的某国的人说法，共产党的邪恶让美国彻彻底底傻了眼。现在在整个美国的保守派大会上，这两天我高度关注着。所有的话题就两件事，偷盗选举、灭共。所有灭共都是谈病毒，谈病毒必谈我们爆料革命，谈爆料革命必谈新中国联邦。谈美国[的]未来，谈美国的宗教，谈美国的自由，谈美国的言论自由，必谈中共，因为什么？它干掉了Twitter、Facebook。Facebook、Twitter正在走向死亡的时刻！因为什么？因为共产党的背后的控制。是我们告诉美国，共产党认为，世界上他认为最大的武器叫社交媒体。

The CCP is true evil. Yesterday, according to the words of a person who is in a country not to be named, “The CCP is so evil that it has completely shocked America.” Currently, at the CPAC, which I have paid close attention to in the past couple of days, all topics were about two things: the stolen presidential election and taking down the CCP! All the topics about taking down the CCP are related to the virus. When talking about the virus, they must mention the Whistleblower Movement. When it comes to the Whistleblower Movement, they must reference the New Federal State of China. When it comes to America’s future, the religions, the freedom, the freedom of speech in America, they must talk about the CCP! Because the CCP has screwed Twitter and Facebook. Twitter and Facebook are on the way to death. Why? Because of the CCP’s control behind the scene. It’s us who told America that the CCP believes that the most powerful weapon in this world is called ‘Social Media’!”

据说在保守党大会里边，多个私下讨论会议的会议室[里]，无数次的重放，很多有关咱们的视频，和咱们提供的中英文字幕的视频，这就是爆料革命！战友们，你想不牛都不行，灭共没有你们不行。这个世界要想安全，要想生存，要想找到真相，没爆料革命没新中国联邦，绝对不中，绝对不中，绝对不中，就敢这么说！

I’ve heard that in multiple private meeting rooms in the CPAC, they played the videos provided by the Whistleblower Movement over and over again, videos with Chinese and English subtitles. That is our Whistleblower Movement! Our fellow fighters, we must accept how awesome we are! We can’t take down the CCP without you! If this world still wants to have safety, to survive, to find the truth, it can’t ignore the Whistleblower Movement or the New Federal State of China. Otherwise, it would be impossible! No way! We must dare to say so!

接下来你们会看到以毒灭共、以钱灭共，会让全世界什么样的力量[集]结在一起。沼泽地这个江湖，我们是要拿下的，因为我们有这个能力。

Next, you will see what kind of forces around the world will unite together under the idea of “taking down the CCP by spreading the truth about the virus and by financial activities”.  We will make the “swamp” work with us because we have the capability!
