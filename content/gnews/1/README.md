For more than 100 years, the Chinese people have been pursuing freedom and democracy. Yet history is dotted with numerous failed attempts: Hundred Days’ Reform, the Constitutional Reform of the Qing Dynasty, the Revolution of 1911, the May Fourth Movement, Song Jiaoren’s advocacy for responsible government, Chen Jiongming’s theory of provincial union and autonomy, and then Xidan Democracy Wall in 1978 and Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.

Since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took over in 1949, it has ruled over the Chinese people through lies and violence. The CCP promises democracy and universal suffrage but the so-called democracy and universal suffrage are nothing but smoke and mirrors. We the Chinese people have been treated as slaves or crushed with brutal forces.

Miles Guo is a successful entrepreneur from China, he has been brutally persecuted by the CCP’s tyranny and forced to go in exile to the United States. In 2017, he launched the Whistleblower Movement exposing the corruption and tyranny of the CCP. Since then, Miles has alerted the world that the CCP has colluded with the Wall Street, Silicon Valley, main stream media and many politicians here in the US. He warned the world that COVID-19 is a biological weapon made by the CCP. He also exposed the astonishing fact that the CCP has been interfering in American politics to change the outcome of the US presidential election.

The New Federal State of China is a global Chinese organization led by Miles Guo for those who are unwilling to become slaves to the CCP. It is committed to take down the CCP and build a constitutional China that respects human rights, freedom and democracy for the people worldwide. The New Federal State of China and its people will be in peace with the people of the world forever.

The American presidential election is facing threats of being stolen by the CCP and corrupt American politicians. The country is terrorized by Antifa’s violence meanwhile real information is being suppressed by the mainstream media. This is no different from living under the tyrannical rule of the CCP. If the American people yield, tomorrow’s America will be just like today’s China under the iron fist of the CCP. We the people of the New Federal State of China, all around the world, firmly support the American people’s movement to say no to election fraud, violence, or lies, and strive for fair elections in accordance with the law.
