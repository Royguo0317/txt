刚刚美国川普总统发表讲话，解释发生于1月6日的国会大厦被入侵事件真相，呼吁民众恢复信心，重建美国法治秩序，并声称“不可思议的旅程才刚刚开始”。以下为演讲全文：

I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States capital like all Americans I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem.

首先，我要谈谈对美国首府的惨烈袭击，就像所有美国人一样，我对暴力，违法行为和混乱感到愤怒

I immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.

我立即部署了国民警卫队和采取联邦法律来保护国会大楼并驱逐入侵者

America is and must always be a nation of law and order.

美国是而且必须永远是法治国家

The demonstrators who infiltrated the capital have defiled the seat of American democracy to those who engage in the acts of violence and destruction.

渗透到首府的示威者已将美国民主的根基给了那些从事暴力和破坏行为的人

You do not represent our country and to those who broke the law, you will pay.

你们不代表我们的国家，对于违反法律的人，你们将付出代价

We have just been through an intense selection and emotions are high, but now tempers must be cooled and calm we start.

我们刚刚经历了激烈的选择，情绪高涨，但是现在我们必须冷静下来，保持冷静

We must get on with the business of America, my campaign vigorously pursued every legal Avenue to contest the election results.

美国必须继续开展商务，我的竞选活动积极地遵守法律，以争取选举结果

My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote in so doing I was fighting to defend American democracy.

我唯一的目标是确保投票的合法性，以此来捍卫美国的民主

I continue to strongly believe that we must reform our election laws to verify the identity and eligibility of all voters and to insure faith and confidence in all future elections.

我继续坚信，我们必须改革选举法，核实所有选民的身份和资格，并确保对今后所有选举的信仰和信心。

Now Congress has certified the results and new administration will be inaugurated on January 20 my focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly, and seamless transition of power.

现在，国会已经批准了大选结果。新的政府将于1月20日走马上任，我现在的工作重点是确保权力的平稳，有序和无缝过渡

This moment calls for healing and reconciliation. 2020 has been a challenging time for our people.

这一刻需要治愈与和解。 2020年对我们的人民来说是充满挑战的时刻

A menacing pandemic has upended the lives of our citizens, isolated millions in their homes, damaged our economy and claimed countless lives.

一场令人发指的病毒大流行摧毁了我们人民的生活，使数百万的人与家隔离，破坏了我们的经济并夺去了无数生命

Defeating this pandemic and rebuilding the greatest economy on earth will require all of us working together.

战胜这种病毒并重建地球上最大的经济体将需要我们所有人共同努力

It will require a renewed emphasis on the civic values of patriotism, faith, charity, community, and family.

它将需要重新强调爱国，信仰，慈善，社区和家庭的公民价值观

We must revitalize the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that bind us together as one national family.

我们必须振兴神圣的爱情和忠诚纽带，将我们团结成一个民族大家庭

To the citizens of our country serving as your president has been the honor of my lifetime and to all of my wonderful supporters

对人民而言，担任你们的总统一直是我一生的荣幸，也是我所有杰出支持者的荣幸

I know you are disappointed but I also want you to know that our incredible journey is only just beginning.

我知道你很失望，但我也想让你知道我们不可思议的旅程才刚刚开始

Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

谢谢你，上帝保佑你，上帝保佑美国
