新闻简述：2021年3月13日的盖特中，郭先生说关于病毒和香港人权的两个《白皮书》有重大意义。这两个白皮书的发表等同于全世界向中共宣战。来自于学术界各领域的中国同胞参与了这个病毒报告的撰写。香港政府内部有良知的官员和警察在香港人权报告撰写过程中提供了关键的信息和帮助。当然，这些人中许多是爆料革命的战友。无论天气如何变换，太阳总会升起，请战友们保持信念，对世界和爆料革命的胜利抱有信心。

**两个白皮书的公布将等同于全世界向中共宣战**

**Two White Paper Reports Are Equivalent to the Declaration of A War Against the CCP**

尊敬的战友们好！3月13号。哎呀，真快啊，我刚才差点说3月12号，3月13号了。继昨天文贵推出盖特之后，好像这个世界发生很多大事，这两个白皮书，很多人意识到了，它是多么的重要，但很多人也没有意识到它有多么的重要。

Dear fellow fighters, today is March 13th! Time flies! I almost mistakenly took today as March 12th. It’s March 13th already. After I posted the Getter yesterday, it seems that many big events are happening in the world. Many people have realized how important the two “white paper” reports are, but others still do not understand their importance.

我告诉大家一个简单的例子，特别像法国，法国这种非常硌涩的这种国家，那种成天装硬骨头、装个性的这种国家，实际上一打就跪下的这种国家，然后平常还有很多发明的这些国家，经济体系在那摆着那。听说他们这些人以后啊，咋说那？别说漏了。听说他们参与到这个写白皮书的人当中，两三波都退掉了，都不敢参与了。为啥呀？战友们去想想，**这个白皮书出来，就等同于全人类向共产党宣战。**那法国的政要们，所谓现在还买疫苗呐，还搞疫苗经济，疫苗安全卡，疫苗健康卡，这不是一场生物大战嘛，那你不是在帮助别人战你自己的国民吗？所以说很多人写着写着就不敢写了，还有人就越想越害怕，就回家抱孩子去了。

Let me give you a simple example. France – a bizarre country like France – always pretends to be tough, unconquerable, and full of personality. Yet in fact, it is easy to be knocked down. There are also countries known for their great inventions and also the limitations in their particular economic structures. I heard some people in these countries – I should be more cautious and do not disclose any secrets – I heard that two or three waves of them who initially participated in the writing of the “white paper” have withdrawn. They dare not participate anymore. Why, fellow fighters? Think about it. The publication of this white paper is equivalent to the declaration of a war by all mankind against the CCP. French politicians are still buying the CCP’s fake vaccines, and promoting the fraudulent vaccine economy – vaccine safety cards and health cards – aiming at controlling people, even after the virus has been confirmed as a biological warfare. Then are you helping the enemy attack your own people? Many participants did not dare to continue after participating for a certain period. Some became more and more afraid that they simply quit the job and went to live ordinary people’s lives.

也听说美国各个机构都盼望着这个白皮书的正式出来。大家可以看到一个问题，这个不是拜登总统新政府搞什么事情，是川普总统的最后一年，一直到现在没有停。这也是美国这个国家的伟大，都乱成这样了，这样的大事没停，都在收集证据。

I have also heard that many U.S. organizations are looking forward to the official release of this white paper. Everyone should know that this was not started by the new administration of President Biden. The development of this paper has been continued from the last year of President Trump’s term to the present time, which shows the greatness of the U.S. as a country. Even though the country has become so chaotic, a major initiative like this was never stopped. Evidence continues to be collected.

难能可贵的事情，我们中国同胞有重要的科学界、知识界、生物界、医药界，有人参与，这给我们中国人在未来，在世界上的形象，挣来了不可估量的巨大的正面的影响力，是用钱不能估量的。我相信这个报告出来时候，上面会写上：该报告得到来自于中国内部的体制内，知识界、医学界、科学界，等等等等，善良有良知的中国人的支持、帮助和提供信息。记住我今天说的话。

Ah, a rare and commendable thing: among the participants that wrote this “white paper”, there are important Chinese compatriots from the fields of science, academia, and biology, and the pharmaceutical industry. Consequently, Chinese people’s positive image has been greatly improved, the influence of which cannot be measured by anything including money. I believe the following will be acknowledged in the report when it is released: Conscientious Chinese people from academia, medical field, scientific community, and other fields inside China have supported, helped, and provided information for this report. Please remember what I said today.

另外一个香港报告，香港的人权，我们要感谢香港有良知的警察。这个报告现在听说：这个最关键的就是得到了香港的警察和香港政府内部人提供的信息。当然有我们爆料革命的战友了，是吧？提供的信息，提供的巨大的帮助，未来也会写上：要感谢来自于香港的，有良知的警察和政府公务员，以及冒着生命危险的，有良知的人士提供的信息。这都得有。所以说战友们，对这个世界永远要充满着信心，不管是打雷、下雨、阴天，你要想到：这些都是雨过天晴，太阳还会从东边升起来。这是目前我认为从爆料革命到现在，对共产党最大的伤害的是这么一个国际上的公约和国际上的法律。

Regarding the Hong Kong report – the Hong Kong human rights white paper report, we would like to thank the Hong Kong police officers who have a conscience. As the report is being compiled, we have been told that the critical elements are supported by the information provided by Hong Kong police and Hong Kong government insiders. Of course, there are contributions made by our fellow fighters of the Whistleblower Movement, right? The information they provided and the tremendous help they offered, will also be acknowledged in the future: Thanks to the conscientious police and government officials from Hong Kong and the conscientious people who risked their lives for the information. It has to be included. So, fellow fighters, we must always be full of confidence in this world. Whether facing thunder, rain, or cloud, you should have confidence that all these will pass. The sun still rises from the east. According to international conventions and international laws, this will cause the greatest harm to the CCP since the beginning of our Whistleblower Movement.

当然在这之前，对共产党最大的伤害，是川普总统政府，美国优先，中美贸易摩擦，等等等等，包括对中国企业在美国的整个处置，这都是对它的重大的伤害，接近于软脱钩走向硬脱钩，这是对它最大的伤害。最后一年是真正的就是把它定为种族大屠杀、反人类罪，这是致命的伤害。当然爆料革命这个刀每天都是往那扔，是吧？劈里啪啦的没停过，这是重中之重，咱就不吹了，是吧？咱不自恋了。

Of course, before this, the biggest harm to the CCP was the American First policies of the Trump administration. Sino-U.S. trade frictions, including the broad sanctions on the military-linked CCP companies in the U.S. have caused serious harm to them. Soft decoupling and complete decoupling inflict the greatest damage on the CCP. In the last year [of his administration], the most severe harm was to designate the CCP as having committed genocide and crimes against humanity. This is fatal to them. Of course, the Whistleblower Movement is throwing knives towards the CCP every day, which has never stopped. This is the top priority. We will not brag too much, right? Let’s stop being narcissistic.
