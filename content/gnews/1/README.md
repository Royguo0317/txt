由第一夫人梅拉尼婭·川普撰寫

It was two weeks ago when I received the diagnosis that so many Americans across our country and the world had already received—I tested positive for COVID-19. To make matters worse, my husband, and our nation’s Commander-in-Chief, received the same news.

兩周前，我接到了全國乃至全世界許多美國人都曾接到過的診斷—我的COVID-19測試呈陽性。更糟糕的是，我的丈夫，國家的總指揮官，也收到了同樣的消息。

Naturally my mind went immediately to our son. To our great relief he tested negative, but again, as so many parents have thought over the past several months, I couldn’t help but think “what about tomorrow or the next day?” My fear came true when he was tested again and it came up positive. Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms. In one way I was glad the three of us went through this at the same time so we could take care of one another and spend time together. He has since tested negative.

很自然的，我立刻想到了我們的兒子。令我們感到欣慰的是，他的測試呈陰性。但是，如同過去幾個月許多父母所想過的那樣，我忍不住想「明天或者後天會怎麼樣？」當他再次測試的時候，我的恐懼變成了現實，他被檢測為陽性。幸運的是，他是一個強壯的少年並且沒有任何症狀。在某種程度上，我很高興我們三個人同時經歷了這個過程，因為我們可以互相照顧，一起度過這段時光。他隨後測試為陰性。

I was very fortunate as my diagnosis came with minimal symptoms, though they hit me all at once and it seemed to be a roller coaster of symptoms in the days after. I experienced body aches, a cough and headaches, and felt extremely tired most of the time. I chose to go a more natural route in terms of medicine, opting more for vitamins and healthy food. We had wonderful caretakers around us and we will be forever grateful for the medical care and professional discretion we received from Dr. Conley and his team. It was an unfamiliar feeling for me to be the patient instead of a person trying to encourage our nation to stay healthy and safe. It was me being taken care of now, and getting first-hand experience with all that COVID-19 can do. As the patient, and the person benefitting from so much medical support, I found myself even more grateful and in awe of caretakers and first responders everywhere. To the medical staff and the residence staff who have been taking care of our family—thank you doesn’t say enough.

我很幸運，因為剛診斷出時的症狀極少，雖然這些症狀同時來襲，並且在之後的日子里症狀反應猶如過山車。我經歷了身體酸痛、咳嗽和頭痛，並且在大多數時候感覺極其疲倦。我選擇了相對自然的醫藥療法，選擇更多的維生素和健康食物。我們周圍有許多優秀的護工，我們會永遠感激 Conley 醫生及其團隊提供的醫療保健及專業判斷。自己成為病人，而不是那個竭力鼓勵我們的國家要保持健康和安全的人，對我而言，是一種令人陌生的感覺。我現在是被照顧的人，並且獲得了 COVID-19 一切的第一手經驗。作為患者，以及從如此多的醫療支持中受益的人，我發現自己甚至更加感激，並且敬重各地的護工及急救人員。對於一直照顧我們家人的醫務人員和住所員工的感激之語，言之不盡。

Recovering from an illness gives you a lot of time to reflect. When my husband was taken to Walter Reed as a precaution, I spent much of my time reflecting on my family. I also thought about the hundreds of thousands of people across our country who have been impacted by this illness that infects people with no discrimination. We are in unprecedented times—and with the election fast approaching, it has been easy to get caught up in so much negative energy.

疾病恢復過程帶給您許多時間去反思。當我丈夫為保險起見被帶到 Walter Reed 時，我用了很多時間來對家庭進行反思。我還想到了全國成千上萬的人受到這個疾病的影響，這個疾病無孔不入。我們正處於前所未有的時代，並且，隨著選舉的臨近，我們很容易陷入如此多的負能量當中。

It also cheered me to think of all the people I have met across our country and the world—and the goodness and compassion that exists if you seek it out. Our country has overcome many hardships and much adversity, and it is my hope COVID-19 will be another obstacle we will be able to tell future generations we overcame—and learned from in the process.

想到在我們國家和世界上我遇到的所有人，也讓我感到高興 — 如果你去尋找，就會發現他們的善良和同情心。我們的國家已經克服了許多困難和逆境，我希望我們將能夠告訴後代， COVID-19是我們克服的另一個障礙，並從中吸取了教訓。

I encourage everyone to continue to live the healthiest life they can. A balanced diet, fresh air, and vitamins really are vital to keep our bodies healthy. For your complete well-being, compassion and humility are just as important in keeping our minds strong. For me personally, the most impactful part of my recovery was the opportunity to reflect on many things—family, friendships, my work, and staying true to who you are.

我鼓勵每個人繼續過自己能及的最健康的生活。均衡的飲食、新鮮的空氣和維生素確實是保持我們身體健康的關鍵。為了你的全面健康，同情心和謙遜對保持我們心靈的強大同樣重要。對我個人來說，康復過程中對我影響最大的部分是有機會反思很多事情：家庭、友誼、工作，以及保持真我。

I am happy to report that I have tested negative and hope to resume my duties as soon as I can. Along with this good news, I want people to know that I understand just how fortunate my family is to have received the kind of care that we did. If you are sick, or if you have a loved one who is sick—I am thinking of you and will be thinking of you every day. I pray for our country and I pray for everyone who is grappling with COVID-19 and any other illnesses or challenges.

我很高興地報告，我的檢測結果已經為陰性，同時希望盡快恢復工作。除了這個好消息，我想讓人們知道，我明白我的家人得到這種照料是多麼的幸運。如果您生病了，或者您有親人生病了，我在想著您，而且每天會想著您。我為我們的國家祈禱，也為每一個正在與COVID-19以及任何其它疾病或挑戰作鬥爭的人祈禱。

Thank you to everyone who reached out, and offered well wishes and prayers for our family. You remain in ours as well.

感謝每一位伸出援助之手的人，為我們的家庭祝福和祈禱的人。你們也是我們的家人。

Sincerely,

真誠的，

Melania Trump

梅拉尼婭·川普
