川普总统1月13日在白宫的电视讲话【1】，根据讲话录音整理，仅供参考。

我的美国同胞们，

今晚我想和你谈谈过去一周的麻烦事。正如我所说，我们共和国的心脏，美国的国会受到了冲击。

它激怒和震惊了数百万的美国人和各个政治阶层。

我想说清楚，我毫不迟疑地谴责上周我们看到的暴力，暴力和破坏在我们国家和我们的运动中绝对没有一席之地。使美国再次伟大一直是为了捍卫法治，支持执法人员，维护我们国家最神圣的传统和价值观，暴民的暴力行为违背了一切。

我相信，我们的运动所代表的一切，我的真正支持者永远不会赞同政治暴力；我的真正支持者永远不会不尊重执法部门，也不会不尊重我们伟大的美国国旗；我的真正支持者永远不能威胁或骚扰他们的美国同胞。如果你做这些事，你就不是在支持我们的运动，你在攻击我们的运动，你在攻击我们的国家，我们不能容忍这样的悲剧，

在过去的一年里，中共国病毒使我们如此困难，我们看到政治暴力的失控，我们看到了太多的骚乱，太多的暴徒，太多的恐吓和破坏行为。无论你是右派，还是左派，民主党还是共和党，都必须停止。

暴力是没有任何理由，没有借口，没有例外，美国是一个法制国家，上周参与袭击的人将被绳之以法。

现在，我要求每一个相信我们（有正义）程序的人都要想办法缓和紧张局势，平息情绪，帮助促进国家的平和。

有报道称，未来几天在首都华盛顿，以及全国各地正在计划更多的示威游行，特勤局向我通报了潜在的威胁。

每个美国人都应该以一种尊重与和平的方式表达自己的意见，你是在履行第一修正案，对吗？但我强调不能有任何暴力、违法和任何形式的破坏行为，每个人都必须遵守我们的法律，服从执法部门的指令。

我已经命令联邦机构动用一切必要资源维持秩序，在华盛顿特区，我们请来了数千名国民警卫队，

以确保城市的安全和不出意外的过渡。

像你们所有人一样，我对上周发生在首都的灾难感到震惊和悲痛。

我要感谢数以亿计的美国公民，他们以冷静、温和以及优雅的态度回应了这一时刻，我们会像往常一样，战胜这个挑战。

我还想说几句关于对言论自由受到的前所未有的攻击，这几天我们看到了，现在是审查、取消和列入黑名单的紧张和困难时期，我们的同胞错了，他们很危险。我们现在需要的是彼此倾听，而不是噤声，我们都可以选择，通过我们的行动来超越障碍，找到共同点和共同目标。

我们必须着眼于增进国家的利益，制造奇迹般的疫苗，战胜流行病，重建经济，保护国家安全，维护法治，而不是让你噤声。

今天，我呼吁所有美国人克制当前的激愤，团结起来，争作一名（合格的）美国公民。

让我们携手向前，为了我们的家庭，我们的社区，我们的国家。

谢谢您！

上帝保佑你！

天佑美国！

英语原文：

My fellow Americans.

I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of the past week. As I have said, the incursion  of the US capital struck at the very heart of our republic.

It angered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum. I want to be very clear. I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement. Making America great again has always been about defending the rule of law supporting the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation’s most sacred traditions and values.

Mob violence goes against everything, I believe in, and everything our movement stands for.

No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence.

No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement, or our great American flag.

No true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans If you do any of these things, you are not supporting our movement, you’re attacking it, and you are attacking our country.

We cannot tolerate it tragically, over the course of the past year, made so difficult because of CCP Virus.

We have seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs, too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop whether you are on the right, or on, the left, a democrat, or a republican. There is never a justification for violence. No excuses. No exceptions. America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will be brought to justice.

Now, I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of ways to ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country.

There has been reporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days.

Both here in Washington, and across the country. I have been briefed by the us secret service on the potential threats, every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful and peaceful way.

That is your First Amendment, right? But I cannot emphasize that there must be no violence, no law breaking, and no vandalism of any kind. Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement. I have directed federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order.

In Washington, DC we are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensure that a transition can occur safely and without incident.

Like all of you, I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the capital last week.

I want to thank the hundreds of millions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm, moderation and grace. We will get through this Challenge, just like we always do.

I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on Free speech.

We have seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times the efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist. Our fellow citizens are wrong. and They are dangerous.

What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose

by our actions to rise above the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose.

We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic, rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security, and upholding the rule of law.

Today, I’m calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and joined together as one American people.

Let us choose to move forward united for the good of our families, our communities, and our country.

Thank you.

God bless you.

And god bless America.
