## 中共挑战SWIFT美元支付系统相当于找死
` Himalaya Rose Garden Team` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/1078695/)

**简述：在2021年4月7日的盖特视频中，郭先生分析中共挑战SWIFT系统是自己作死。人民币国际交易系统的全球交易额只占国际市场的2%，但是中共却想以此挑战美元国际支付系统，虽然中共国每年的粮食进口和出口产业都离了SWIFT系统不能活。他还透露美国只有灭共，美国经济才能重回强大，会不惜一切代价动用SWIFT、比特币、世界银行、IMF货币组织、世界贸易组织，全面对中共开战。也当然不会有美景冬奥会了。**

**中共挑战****SWIFT****美元支付系统相当于找死**

**CCP Challenging SWIFT Is Equivalent to Committing A Suicide**

你说，全世界SWIFT，也就是美元支付系统，这个支付系统在全世界大家知道每年来来往往将近上百万亿美元交易，上百万亿美元。共产党要挑战SWIFT，结果整了一个CIPS，就是所谓的人民币的国际支付系统，发动了几十个国家，上百个国家，非洲啊，是吧？俄罗斯啊，东欧啊……然后自己做自己，就这么做。一年做了3万多笔，3万多笔还是300多万笔我忘了，加在一起全年3亿多美元。SWIFT一天做300万甚至达到800万笔，一天做多少呢？4万亿或者3万亿美元。过去折腾了几年了，CIPS人民币的国际货币交易系统在全世界占2%，全世界占2%。然后呢要挑战SWIFT。找死呢吧？找死呢吧！

You know about the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) system, which is a network tracking transactions in U.S. dollars. You all know that this system handles transactions in the order of trillions of dollars per year. Now the CCP is trying to challenge the SWIFT system and has launched the CIPS system (Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System), a so-called RMB international payment system. The CCP has mobilized about a hundred countries, including African countries, Russia, and Eastern Europe. Then they operate the system within themselves. But there are only approximately 30,000 transactions through the CIPS system a year. I am not so sure whether it is 30 thousand or 3 million transactions. Anyway, the total amount is about 300 million U.S. dollars per year. In comparison, the SWIFT system handles 3 million to even 8 million transactions per day. How much money in total per day? Four trillion or 3 trillion U.S. dollars per day. The CIPS RMB international transaction system has been around for a few years already, but it accounts for only 2% of the global market share. Nevertheless, the CCP still wants to challenge the SWIFT system. Does the CCP want to commit a suicide? They are arranging their own demise.

这还不说，跟中国人民息息有关的（是）中国人买粮食，中国一年最低买5亿吨（粮食），像去年（的情况）到现在要买8亿吨甚至9亿吨（粮食）。（如果）不买这些粮食中国人就得饿死人，这是一定是这样的。它（共产党）买粮食要通过什么？阿姆斯特丹有SWIFT交易中心，纽约有SWIFT交易中心，比利时有SWIFT交易中心，总部在比利时，SWIFT。（因为）也逃税啊，是吧？

In addition, China’s food importation is an issue that affects Chinese people directly. China must buy at least 500 million tons of grain per year. In a dire situation like last year, China has to import as much as 800 million or even 900 million tons of grain. If they do not import this much food, Chinese people will die due to the lack of food. It cannot be otherwise. How does the CCP complete its transactions for food purchases? There is a SWIFT trading center in Amsterdam, one in New York and one in Belgium. The headquarter is in Belgium for the sake of tax evasion, right?

你动任何一分钱SWIFT都知道。这是真正的沼泽地大佬：SWIFT，还有美国的美联储。世界上国际三大机构：WTO国际贸易（组织），世界银行美国人说了算，IMF世界货币组织（是）一个欧洲人说了算，世界国际组织这三大机构，再加上SWIFT。你去想一想兄弟姐妹们，共产党挑战它（能）有机会吗？

The SWIFT system tracks every penny of U.S. Dollar transaction. The real “swamp” tycoons are  SWIFT and the U.S. Federal Reserve. There are three major international organizations in the world: the WTO (World Trade Organization), the World Bank controlled by Americans, and the IMF (International Monetary Fund) by Europeans. Think about these three major international organizations and the SWIFT system, brothers and sisters. Does the CCP have a chance to challenge them?

8亿吨的粮食不拿美金买拿什么买，啊？拿啥买？关键是最夸张的（共产党）一年的出口20万亿人民币，大概4万亿美元，大概每年出口4万亿美元，所有的（加一起）啊。那么这些是多少钱呢，战友们知道不？相当于6亿人口，（这6亿人）所有人靠这活着。如果1.8亿到2亿人的就业，按一家两三口人（算），就是5、6亿人靠这活着。你（共产党）这个要整不成，这一、二十万亿人民币（的出口量）就死球蛋了，你拿啥挑战美国？所以共产党它就（是在）作死呢，跟着俄罗斯要搞一个所谓的支付系统。俄罗斯搞支付系统一年搞下来多少钱知道不？6亿美元。丢死人了吧？！

In what currency could the CCP pay for the 800 million tons of grain if it is not in U.S. dollars? In what currency can the CCP pay for it? The most absurd thing is that the CCP’s exports are about 20 trillion yuan a year. That is equivalent to 4 trillion U.S. dollars. So, Chinese exports are about 4 trillion U.S. dollars in total a year. What does that mean, my fellow fighters? It is like 600 million people relying on this to survive. Let’s assume 180 million to 200 million workers rely on these jobs, and each of them has two or three family members. That would mean 500 to 600 million people live on these exports. If the CCP failed to do 10 to 20 trillion yuan of exports every year, it would be difficult for them to survive. So how can they challenge the U.S.? It’s really committing a suicide. They intend to create a payment system together with Russia. Do you know the value of all the transactions that the Russia’s system has handled in one year? The answer is $600 million U.S. dollars, which is too embarrassing, right?

我想告诉大家什么，今天？共产党[面临的]是：如果很快世界银行剔除中共，IMF世界货币组织剔除中共，世界贸易组织剔除中共，支付系统美元SWIFT剔除中共，然后给共产党更加致命一击[的是]比特币被列为全世界的犯罪货币或比特币被美国所接受成为合法流通货币但是要接受这个条件 – 就是透明化。共产党高官的洗钱基本完球蛋！

What do I want to tell everyone today? What situation will the CCP be facing if the World Bank kicks it out soon, the IMF kicks it out, the WTO kicks it out, and the SWIFT system kicks it out? And then a fatal strike to the CCP would be the Bitcoin being designated as an international criminal cryptocurrency or alternatively, being accepted by the U.S. as a legal currency, but with the condition that it must go transparent. If that happens, the money laundering scheme of the CCP’s high-ranking officials will be basically over.

那就不是脱钩啦，那就是直接把钩（子）喂到了共产党这个愚蠢的猪的嗓子里边儿去啦！人家是钓鱼，这是钓猪！钓中共（这头）猪！所以说兄弟姐妹们，到那时候你们再看这个世界。所以现在你看这个世界多疯狂？

That is not just decoupling. It would be like pushing the hook directly into the throat of the stupid pig, the CCP pig. People typically fish. Yet, this is fishing for a pig, fishing the CCP pig. So, brothers and sisters, let us wait and see. So you see how crazy the world is right now.

美国内部所有的激励措施都用完，美元一定完球蛋。（美国）没有任何机会和余地阻止美元和美元经济下滑。共产党是垂死挣扎。只有灭共，美国经济才能重回强大，（但）也得（度得）过这个震荡期，这就是事实。（大家）坐好，坐好家里的椅子吧，兄弟姐妹们，没事儿把你家椅子多钉几根儿钉啊，（因为）这个世界现在很疯狂。

When the U.S. is running out all its stimulus plans, the U.S. dollar is bound to collapse. There is no chance for it to stop the U.S. dollars from declining or the downturn of the U.S. economy. The CCP is putting up a last-ditch struggle. Only by taking down the CCP can the U.S. economy regain its strength. Even if they do this, they must still go through a turbulent period. That is a fact. Everybody should sit still in your chair, brothers and sisters. When you have time, you’d better put a few more nails in your chair to make it more stable because the world is so crazy right now.

当昨天、前天了解到美国要采取这些行动的时候，全面调查病毒必须调查真相，告诉世界谁不配合谁就是我的敌人，然后不惜一切代价动用SWIFT、比特币、世界银行、IMF货币组织、世界这个贸易组织，全面对中共开战。当然没有冬季奥运会了，啥概念，兄弟姐妹们？

I learned yesterday and the day before that the U.S. will take some actions. The U.S. will conduct a comprehensive investigation of the origin of the virus to find out the truth. Whoever does not cooperate will be treated as an enemy. Then the U.S. will initiate full-scale warfare against the CCP via the SWIFT, Bitcoin, the World Bank, the IMF, and the WTO. Of course, there will be no [Beijing] Winter Olympics. What does that mean, brothers and sisters?
