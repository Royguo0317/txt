1211晚间要闻-NewYork Time

LuDe Media 20201211 Evening News New York Time

**联邦最高法院7:2驳回德州诉讼**

**Federal Supreme Court Dismissed Texas lawsuit 7-2**

包括川普最新任命的Coney Barrett等3人在内的7名最高大法官驳回的理由是，德州缺乏能够起诉其他州的宪法地位。2名布什政府提名的法官Samuel Alito和Clarence Thomas则支持受理该起诉讼，理由是该案件属于联邦最高法院的管辖范围，最高大法官无权否决德州提交的诉状。

Seven top justices, including three of Trump’s most recent appointees, including Coney Barrett, dismissed the case on the grounds that Texas lacked the constitutional standing to sue other states. Two Bush administration nominees, Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, upheld the case on the grounds that it fell within the jurisdiction of the federal Supreme Court, which has no authority to overrule a lawsuit filed by Texas.

**读懂最高法院判决背后内容，川普总统连任无悬念**

**Understanding the Content Behind the Supreme Court Decision, President Trump’s Re-election is Not in Doubt**

如果联邦最高法院同意受理德州诉讼案，那民主党州也可以反过来起诉共和党州，目前川普占据主动的法律战将变成一场混战，短时间分不出胜负，反而打乱川普团队的整体战术。

川普团队的战术，是在临近1月6日前，放出大招绝杀，让对手没有时间翻盘。若提前放出大招，会给对手反击时间，让自己陷于被动挨打局面、极易被攻破。

川普提名的3名大法官都否决了共和党州的诉讼，在民主党和中间派选民中极大地提升了公正性，为其以后判决的权威性奠定了坚实民意基础。

德州诉讼案，吸引了包括阿拉斯加在内的近20个州加入支持，引起了巨大轰动效应，唤醒了更多的民众。强大的民意将影响最高法院的最终判决。

If the federal Supreme Court agrees to accept the Texas lawsuit, the Democratic states can also countersuit the Republican states, and the current legal battle in which Trump takes the initiative will become a melee, hence the merits of the case cannot be divided in a short time, but to disrupt the overall tactic of the Trump team.

The Trump team’s tactic is to release a big move close to January 6, so that the opponent does not have much time to turn the tide. If the big move is released too early, it will give the opponent time to counterattack, which put themselves in a passive situation and will be easily broken.

The three justices nominated by Trump all overruled the Republican states’ lawsuit, which greatly enhanced its impartiality among Democratic and centrist voters and laid a solid public foundation for the authority of its future decisions.

The Texas lawsuit, which attracted nearly 20 states, including Alaska, to join in support, caused a huge sensational effect and awakened more people. The strong public opinion will influence the final decision of the Supreme Court.

**如何理解郭先生直播提到的沼泽地！**

**How to Understand the Swamp Mentioned by Mr. Guo in Live Broadcast**

就像江河湖泊，沼泽地也是自然生态的组成部分，美国政治沼泽地也是其政治生态的组成部分。它的存在，是因为其背后的力量、也就是决定美国和世界秩序的核心利益集团，他们需要这个沼泽地。

他们最看重的是实力，而不是民主、自由；同时，为了维持自己建立的这个世界秩序，他们需要有信仰、需要有底线。

这个力量如此强大，没有谁能抽干。谁想代表美国、谁想代表中国，都要与他们合作，他们决定着美国、也决定着中国的命运。

他们以前默许毛贼东制造的巨大人道灾难，是因为没损害他们利益，不会多管闲事；与邓、江、胡合作，是因为有巨大利益；但习近平在香港事件、病毒生物武器、大选操纵上挑战他们，让他们的利益受到巨大损害，他们真正感到了恐惧，遂下了决心灭共。

他们唯一担心的是，灭共后谁代表中国能给他们带来最大的利益。在最恰当的时间点，有信仰的新中国联邦横空出世，成了他们可选的、不一定是最佳的、但是唯一的选择。

Just as rivers and lakes, swamps are part of the natural ecology, so is the U.S. political swamp part of its political ecology. It exists because the forces behind it, the core interest groups that determine the U.S. and world order, need this swamp.

What they value most is strength, not democracy or freedom. and meanwhile, they have faith and bottom lines in order to maintain this world order that they built.

This swamp is so powerful that no one can completely drain it. Anyone who wants to represent the United States and anyone who wants to represent China has to cooperate with them, and they decide the fate of the United States and also of China.

They used to acquiesce to the huge humanitarian disasters caused by Mao because it did not harm their interests, so they would not meddle; they cooperated with Deng, Jiang, and Hu because there were huge interests; but Xi Jinping challenged them on the Hong Kong Affair, the virus bio-weapons, and the election rigging, which caused huge damage to their interests, so they felt a real fear and resolved to exterminate the CCP.

Their only concern is who can bring them the greatest benefit on behalf of China after the destruction of the CCP. At the most opportune moment, the New Federal State of China with faith emerged and became their choice, not necessarily the best, but the only one.

**黑名单上的王晨在北京参加美国商会晚宴**

**Blacklisted Wang Chen Attends American Chamber of Commerce Dinner in Beijing**

中共再耍无赖招数，派已经被美国列入制裁黑名单的人大副委员长王晨，参加了12月10日**在北京**举行的中国美国商会晚宴并致辞。该商会代表了与中共勾兑的主要美国企业。

In another rogue move, the Chinese Communist Party sent Wang Chen, vice chairman of the National People’s Congress (NPC), who has been blacklisted by the United States for sanctions, to attend and address a dinner at the American Chamber of Commerce in China in Beijing on December 10. The Chamber of Commerce represents major U.S. companies that have colluded with the Chinese Communist Party.
