## 美國國務卿蓬佩奧在7月8日新聞發佈會上的講話
`2020-07-12 12:58 GM31` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hant/263105/)

SECRETARY POMPEO:  Good morning, everyone.  Hope everybody had a great 4th of July celebrating the founding of this great country, and a week from today I’ll be in Philadelphia talking about the work of the Unalienable Rights Commission.  I’m looking forward to that.

彭佩奧國務卿：大家早上好。希望大家都度過了一個美好的獨立日，慶祝這個偉大國家的成立。從今天開始的一個星期，我將在費城發表“不可剝奪權利委員會”的工作講話。我很期待。

A belated happy birthday to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who celebrated his 85th birthday on Monday of this week.

祝達賴喇嘛尊者生日快樂，本週一是他85歲的生日。

And a big welcome to Mexico’s President Lopez Obrador, who is in Washington today to celebrate the landmark USMCA trade deal coming into force alongside President Trump.  I spoke with the foreign minister yesterday.  I’m looking forward to seeing him here in just a little bit as well.  I think we’ll have a great set of meetings over at the White House later on today.

熱烈地歡迎墨西哥總統洛佩玆·奧夫拉多爾（Lopez Obrador），今天在華盛頓與川普總統一起，慶祝具有里程碑意義的美墨加貿易協議（USMCA）的生效。昨天我與外交部長交談。我也很期待一會在這里見到他。我認為今天晚些時候，我們將在白宮舉行一系列很好的會晤。

On Monday, Egypt released U.S. citizen Mohamed Amashah, who had been detained since March of 2019. Mohamed is one of many Americans President Trump’s administration has worked tirelessly to get back home, and we thank Egypt for securing his release and his repatriation. But at the same time, we urge Egyptian officials to stop unwarranted harassment of U.S. citizens and their families who remain there.

周一，埃及釋放了自2019年3月以來一直被拘留的美國公民穆罕默德·阿瑪莎（Mohamed Amashah）。穆罕默德（Mohamed）是川普政府為他們回國而不懈努力的眾多美國人之一，我們感謝埃及確保釋放他和讓他归国。但与此同时，我们敦促埃及官员停止对留在那里的美国公民及其家人的无理骚扰。

**I want to start today with the Chinese Communist Party.**

**As with all unelected, communist regimes, Beijing fears its own people’s free thinking more than any foreign foe.** We were deeply troubled to learn this week that the CCP detained Xu Zhangrun for criticizing General Secretary Xi Jinping’s repressive regime and the CCP’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic.  He should be released.  He was simply telling the truth.  He should be released as soon as possible.

今天的發布會我要從中國共產黨開始談起。

**與所有不是由選舉產生的共產主義政權一樣，北京比害怕它的“外國敵人”更擔心自己人民的思想自由。** 令我們深感不安的是，本周得知中共拘留了徐章潤，因為他批評習近平總書記的壓迫人民的政權和中共對COVID-19大流行的不當處理。 他應該被釋放。 他只是在說實話。 他應該盡快被釋放。

I’ll repeat a theme I’ve been talking about for months:  **The CCP has an enormous credibility problem**.  They failed to tell the world the truth about this virus, and now hundreds of thousands of peoples all across the world are dead.  We need the truth; we still need the truth.  We need to open up.  We need to engage in a serious way with scientists around the world.  And they now say they’re going to allow the WHO to come in.  That’s great, but the WHO needs to be free to do its real work.  We need to make sure the right people are there to engage in this investigation, and we need real answers, not a perfunctory political solution.  This is about science, not politics, and the Chinese Communist Party needs to come clean with the world about this virus.

我將重復一個月來一直討論的主題：**中共存在巨大的信譽問題**。他們沒有告訴世界有關這種病毒的真相，現在全世界成千上萬的人死了。我們需要真相，我們仍然需要真相。我們需要他們開放。我們需要認真地與世界各地的科學家接觸。他們現在說他們將允許世界衛生組織（WHO）進入。那太好了，但是WHO必須有自由做真正的工作。我們需要確保合適的人在那里進行調查，我們需要真正的答案，而不是敷衍的政治解決手法。這是關乎科學的、而不是政治，中共需要與世界一起搞清楚這個病毒。

Beijing claimed for months that it reported the outbreak of the virus to the WHO.  Now we know that’s not true, too.  We know that the WHO’s Country Office in China reported the outbreak only after it picked up a media statement from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.

北京几個月以來一直聲稱向世界衛生組織報告了該病毒的爆發。現在我們知道這也不是真的。我們知道，世衛組織駐中國國家代表處只有在從武漢市衛生委員會獲得媒體聲明后才報告該疫情。

Again, Beijing describes Xinjiang’s internment camps as vocational training camps.  New reports of forced abortions and sterilizations add to a body of evidence that contradicts that.

北京再次將新疆的集中營描述為職業訓練營。關於強迫墮胎和絕育的新報道增加了大量證據證明他們說的與事實相反。

And Beijing said that for 50 years they’d give the people of Hong Kong “a high degree of autonomy.”  And you all have seen what’s happened after only 23 years – empty promises made to the people of Hong Kong and to the world.

北京方面說，五十年來，他們賦予香港人民“高度自治權”。你們都看到了僅僅23年之后發生的事情，對香港人民和全世界的承諾都是假的。

I want to give kudos to Google, Facebook, and Twitter for refusing to surrender user data to the Hong Kong government – other companies should follow them and do the same.

我想表揚Google、Facebook和Twitter拒絕將用戶數據交還給香港政府的做法，其他公司也應像他們那樣做。

And a shoutout to our Canadian friends as well.  Canada has been strong in its response to Beijing’s crackdown.  We think that’s the right course for the entire world to take.

還要表揚我們的加拿大朋友。加拿大對北京的鎮壓反應強烈。我們認為這是整個世界都應該釆取的正確做法。

We’re heartened to see too the United Kingdom have their vigorous debate now on the risk presented to the British people from Huawei technology being in their systems.  As FBI Director Wray said yesterday, Huawei is, quote, “a serial intellectual property thief, with a pattern and practice of disregarding both the rule of law and the rights of its victims.”

我們也很高興看到，英國現在也開始激烈辯論關於華為技朮存在於他們的通信系統中，會給英國人民帶來的風險。正如聯邦調查局局長雷（Wray）昨日所說，華為是“一連串的知識產權竊賊，其行為模式和實踐都無視法治及其受害者的權利。”

I commend to you Director Wray’s entire speech yesterday.  It is worth the time to watch.  Attorney General Barr will deliver a set of remarks in the coming days, and then I’ll give what will be the fourth in a series of remarks.

我評論一下雷主任昨天的講話全文。值得花時間觀看。司法部長巴爾（AG Barr）將在未來几天發表一系列講話，然后我將發表一系列講話的第四次講話。

I want to direct everyone also to a letter that Under Secretary Keith Krach drafted to CEOs, boards of directors, trade groups, commercial investment firms alerting them to the CCP’s use of slave labor in Xinjiang, and providing them with a set of governance recommendations for how they should ensure that they are not part and parcel of this terrible practice.

我還要讓所有人關注基思·克拉奇（Keith Krach）副部長給首席執行官、董事會、貿易集團、商業投資公司的一封信，提醒他們注意中共在新疆使用奴工，并為他們提供了一系列建議，以確保他們自己不是這一可怕行徑的一分子和幫凶。

Last China item:  The CCP recently filed a boundary dispute with Bhutan at a meeting of the Global Environment Facility.

關於中國的最后一個話題：中共最近在全球環境基金會議上向不丹提出了邊界爭端。

From the mountain ranges of the Himalayas to the waters of Vietnam’s Exclusive Zone, to the Senkaku Islands, and beyond, Beijing has a pattern of instigating territorial disputes.  The world shouldn’t allow this bullying to take place, nor should it permit it to continue.

從喜馬拉雅山脈到越南專屬區水域，再到尖閣諸島，乃至其它地區，北京都有引發領土爭端的一貫模式。世界不應該允許這種霸凌行為，也不應允許這種情況繼續下去。

To the Middle East:

On Monday, Iraq tragically lost a patriot, prominent scholar, and journalist when Hisham al-Hashimi was brutally assassinated in front of his home in Baghdad.

Dr. Hashimi had devoted his life to a free and sovereign Iraq, and gave voice to the aspirations of the Iraqi people.  In the days leading up to his death, he was repeatedly threatened by Iran-backed armed groups.

And the United States joins partner nations in strongly condemning his assassination, and call for the Government of Iraq to bring to justice the perpetrators of this terrible crime and bring them swiftly to justice.

關於中東：

星期一，當哈希姆·哈希米在他位於巴格達的家門前遭到殘酷暗殺時，伊拉克悲慘地失去了一名愛國者，杰出的學者和記者。

哈希米博士一生致力於建立一個自由和主權的伊拉克，并表達了伊拉克人民的願望。 在他去世之前的几天里，他多次受到伊朗支持的武裝團體的威脅。

美國與伙伴國家一道強烈譴責他的暗殺行動，并呼吁伊拉克政府將這一可怕罪行的肇事者移送法辦，并迅速將他們繩之以法。

In Syria, the actions of the Assad regime, Russia, and China to constrict the flow of lifesaving supplies, medicine, and food have exacerbated an already terrible humanitarian situation on the ground.

在敘利亞，阿薩德政權、俄羅斯和中國限制救命物資、藥品和食品的流通的行動，加劇了當地本已可怕的人道主義局勢。

Just yesterday, Russia and China once again vetoed action at the UN Security Council that would have maintained humanitarian access to desperate Syrian communities.

就在昨天，俄羅斯和中共再次否決聯合國安理會的行動，本來可以在維持釆取人道主義方式進入絕望的敘利亞地區。

Over the last several months, Russia and the People’s Republic of China have repeatedly abused their veto powers in the council to support the Assad regime strategy of starving its own people.

Their calculus is clear.  They believe there is no price to pay for their actions to the Security Council.  They believe their partnership with the Assad regime will render political and economic benefits that outweigh any cost of conscience or moral obligation.

在過去的几個月中，俄羅斯和中共一再濫用安理會的否決權，來支持阿薩德政權餓死自己人民。他們的槃算很清晰。他們以為在安理會的行為是沒有代價的。他們以為，與阿薩德政權的伙伴關系會帶來政治和經濟利益，而這超過了良心或道德義務的任何成本。

It’s our job, the responsible nations of the world, to increase those costs, document the human impact of these decisions, and use this example to remind the world of what these two regimes stand for.

這是我們的職責，作為世界上負責任的國家來增加这些成本，记录下这些决策對人類的影響，并用這個例子來提醒這個世界這兩個極權代表什么。

I also want to address the deteriorating and immobile oil storage vessel, the *Safer*, that’s floating off in the Red Sea.  Some of you will remember I have spoken about this before, I think.The tanker contains four times the oil spilled in the Exxon Valdez disaster.

我還想談一談日益惡化且無法移動，漂浮在紅海上的儲油船“薩菲爾號”(Saffir)。我想你們中的一些人還記得我曾經講過這個問題。油輪中的石油是埃克森·瓦爾迪茲（Exxon Valdez）災難中洩漏的四倍。

If it ruptures, it will devastate the Red Sea ecosystem and disrupt key shipping lanes in the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb.  A disaster like that could prevent desperately needed food aid from reaching a Yemeni population already in terrible, dire conditions.

如果它破裂，它會毀壞紅海生態系統并破壞紅海與巴巴蒙德布間的主要航線。像這樣的災難可能會阻止迫切需要的糧食援助運抵已經處於可怕的嚴峻條件下的也門人口。

The Houthis have blocked UN officials who need to board the vessel and to do – in order that they may do the work necessary to prevent massive environmental damage throughout the region.  The Houthis must grant access before this ticking time bomb explodes.

可怕的嚴峻條件使胡塞武裝封鎖了需要登船和這樣做的聯合國官員，以便他們進行必要的工作，以防止整個地區遭受嚴重的環境破壞。胡塞武裝必須這個定時炸彈爆炸之前打開通道。

And speaking of the Houthis, and bombs:

Last week, a United Nations report confirmed that the weapons shipments the United States interdicted back in November of 2019 and then again in February of this year were of Iranian origin.  You’ll recall that when we said that, the Iranians denied it.  The UN has now confirmed this.  Iran is not abiding by the UN arms embargo restrictions that are due to expire in less than four months now.

說到胡塞武裝和炸彈：上周聯合國的一份報告證實，美國在2019年11月攔截的武器運輸和今年2月攔截的武器都是來自伊朗。你會記得當時我們是這么說的，當時伊朗否认了，現在聯合國已經確認這一點。伊朗沒有遵守還剩4個月到期的聯合國武器禁運限制。

Now, we have interdicted another shipment of weapons heading to the Houthis.

On June 28th, U.S. and partner forces interdicted a vessel off the coast of Yemen with illicit cargo including 200 RPGs, more than 1,700 AK rifles, 21 – 21 surface-to-air and land-attack missiles, several anti-tank missiles, and other advanced weapons and missiles.

現在，我們攔截了另一批運往胡塞的武器。6月28日，美國和伙伴部隊封鎖了一只也門非法，其中內藏200輛RPG，1,700多支AK步槍，21枚地對空導彈和21枚對地攻擊導彈，數枚反坦克導彈以及其他先進的武器和導彈。

The Security Council must extend the arms embargo on Iran to prevent further conflict in the region.  No serious person can possibly believe Iran would use any weapon it receives for peaceful ends.

安理會必須延長對伊朗的武器禁運，以防止該地區進一步的沖突，沒有任何一個人會相信伊朗會使用收到的任何武器來實現和平的。

Contrast the Islamic Republic of Iran’s illegal gun running with America’s work to help our allies and partners defend themselves:

On Monday – on Monday we notified Congress of $7.5 billion worth of defense sales.  From new rotorcraft capabilities for countries like Lithuania and Indonesia, to new ISR platforms for NATO ally France, to increased infantry mobility in the Stryker platform for Argentina, the United States is meeting the high demand for our allies and partners for American gear to defend their nations.

將伊斯蘭共和國關於非法槍支走私的問題與美國幫助我們的盟友和伙伴自衛的工作進行對比：

周一，我們將75億美元的國防銷售額通知了國會。從立陶宛和印度尼西亞等國的新型旋翼機性能，到北約盟國法國的新ISR平台，再到增強阿根廷的Stryker平台步兵機動性，總價值達5,000億美元的國防銷售額。美國正在滿足對盟國和合作伙伴的強烈要求，用美國裝備來保衛他們的國家。

We are strengthening our security partnerships, building capacity, and supporting the American manufacturing base.

我們正在加強我們安全伙伴關系，提升產能來鞏固美國制造業的基礎。

And now turning to Africa:

We’re making progress in helping Sudan’s transition to a more democratic and peaceful way of life.

現在談到非洲，我們在幫助蘇丹過渡到更加民主和平的生活方式方面取得了進展。

At the Sudan Partnership Conference back on June 25th, the United States announced it will provide $356.2 million to support the Sudan democratic transition, including more than $85 million in development and COVID-19 assistance.

在6月25日舉行的蘇丹伙伴關系會議上，美國宣布將提供3.562億美元支持蘇丹民主過渡，包括超過8500萬美元在發展和支援對抗新冠病毒疫情。

And finally – I’ll close here – as one of our expanding security relationship with the Republic of Cyprus, for the first time, the Department of State intends to provide International Military Education and Training funding to that country, contingent on congressional appropriations and our notification of Congress.

最后的一個話題。作為我與塞浦路斯共和國不斷擴大的安全關系之一，美國國務院打算首次向該國提供國際軍事教育和培訓資金，這要視國會撥款和我們的情況而定。

This is part of our efforts to enhance relationships with key regional partners to promote stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Happy to take some questions.

最這是我們與主要區域伙伴加強關系以促進東地中海穩定的努力的一部分。很高興回答一些問題。

MS ORTAGUS:  Nadia, go ahead.

Nadia，請提問。

QUESTION:  Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

國務卿先生，早上好。

SECRETARY POMPEO:  Nadia, hi.

Nadia，你好。

QUESTION:  You oppose the release of Mr. Kassim Tajideen although you said that you abide by the court decision.  Does this hinder your effort to go after high-target violence here of Hizballah, like Mr. Tajideen?  And what does it say to the people who oppose Hizballah and the people who are trying to give them – support them financially?  And in that regard, for the first time we hear Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the group, yesterday saying that he welcomes U.S. assistance to the Lebanese Government.  Do you see that – although he said U.S. is an enemy.  But do you see this as a way of trying to open some kind of dialogue with the U.S., considering that they release this person, Mr. Tajideen?

盡管您說您遵守法院的裁決，但您反對釋放卡西姆·塔吉德恩先生。這是否會阻礙您努力像塔吉德恩先生一樣追隨真主黨在這里的高目標暴力？這對反對真主黨的人和試圖給予真主黨的人意味着什么？在經濟上支持他們嗎？在这方面，我们第一次听到该集团领导人哈桑·納斯拉拉昨天說，他歡迎美國對黎巴嫩政府的援助。您又聽說嗎？盡管他說美國是敵人。但是您認為這是試圖與美國展開某種對話的一種方式，考慮到他們釋放了塔吉德恩先生這個人？

SECRETARY POMPEO:  Yeah.  So we do everything we can to enforce the sanctions that we have put in place against terrorist figures, including those who have been designated under Hizballah designations.  We’ve urged other countries to designate Hizballah terrorist organization as well.  We continue to believe that they present an enormous risk, and their behavior indicates that they are in fact a terrorist organization that is intent on causing harm to the West, and most in particular to our partner and ally in the region, Israel.

是的因此，我們將竭盡全力執行對恐怖主義分子，包括由真主黨指定的恐怖分子的制裁。我們惇促其他國家也判定真主黨為恐怖组织。我们一直認為，它們搆成了巨大的風險，其行為表明他們實際上就是恐怖主義組織，其意圖是危害西方世界的，尤其是對我們在該地區的伙伴和盟友以色列會造成伤害。

Second, I didn’t see the remarks that you described from Nasrallah.  I did see him say that they should take Iranian oil.  That I saw.  That would be unacceptable for them to do that.  It would be sanctioned product for sure, and we’ll do everything we can to make sure that Iran cannot continue to sell crude oil anywhere, including to Hizballah in the region so that the resources that fund and underwrite the world’s largest state sponsor of terror won’t be made available to them because they were able to sell some crude oil product or some petroleum product to Hizballah.

第二，我沒有聽過您說關於納斯魯拉描述的言論。我聽過他說過他們要接收伊朗原油。我們無法接受他們這樣做。可以肯定的說，這將是經過制裁的產品，我們將盡一切努力確保伊朗不會繼續在任何地方出售原油，包括向該地區的真主黨出售原油，那么就截斷資助和包銷世界最大的恐怖主義的國家的資金鏈，因為他們會向真主黨出售一些原油或石油產品。

QUESTION:  Sorry, just to follow up quickly.  But many people will see the release of Mr. Tajideen as a victory for Hizballah and he might – they might be using it as that and this is why he said we welcome any U.S. assistance and we don’t mind it.

抱歉，很快地跟進一下。但是許多人會看到釋放塔吉德恩先生是真主黨的勝利，他可能會以此為借口，這就是為什么他們說：我們歡迎也不介意美國的任何援助。

SECRETARY POMPEO:  Yeah.  There can be no mistake what the United States has done and will continue to do to put pressure on Hizballah and also to try and assist the people of Lebanon at building out a successful government.  The other component here of course is Lebanon’s incredible struggle to conduct the reforms that are necessary to make sure that the Lebanese people who have been protesting in the streets, simply demanding a government that’s not corrupt, that is engaged in behavior that benefits the Lebanese people – that’s our mission set.  Hizballah is a terrorist organization and we are supportive of Lebanon as long as they get the reforms right and they are not a proxy state for Iran in Lebanon.  It would be a very bad thing for the people throughout Lebanon and we hope that doesn’t happen in Beirut.

是的毫無疑問這就是美國所做的也會繼續對真主黨施加壓力，并試圖幫助黎巴嫩人民建立一個成功的政府。這里的另一個組成部分絕對是黎巴嫩进行了令人难以置信的斗争，以进行必要的改革，以确保一直在街头抗议的黎巴嫩人民只要求一个没有腐败的政府，该政府將做有益於黎巴嫩人民的事，這是我們的任務。真主黨是一個恐怖組織，只要黎巴嫩進行正確的改革，我們就支持黎巴嫩，他們不是黎巴嫩在伊朗的代理國。對於整個黎巴嫩的人民來說，這將是一件非常糟糕的事情，我們希望在貝魯特不會發生這種情況。

MS ORTAGUS:  Nick Schifrin.

尼克·希弗林。

QUESTION:  Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

早上好，國務卿先生。

SECRETARY POMPEO:  Hey, Nick.

QUESTION:  Thank you very much.  Can we do WHO and Iran, if I could.

非常感謝。我們可以談世界衛生組織和伊朗嗎，如果可以的話？

SECRETARY POMPEO:  Sure.  Give it a shot.

好，問吧。

QUESTION:  U.S. law mandates that the administration follow through on the financial pledges to the WHO before the withdrawal next year.  Can you tell us how much the U.S. has paid of that and whether you intend to follow through on the commitments?

And Iran, what’s the message Iranian leaders should draw from the explosion at Natanz?  Do you believe it was accidental or deliberate?

美國法律規定，政府必須在明年撤出之前對世界衛生組織的財務承諾。您能告訴我們美國已經支付了多少錢？您是否打算遵守這些承諾？

伊朗領導人應從納坦玆爆炸案中汲取什么信息？您認為這是偶然的還是故意的？

SECRETARY POMPEO:  I’m not going to talk about the second question.  With respect to the first one, we provided notice yesterday to Capitol Hill of our intent to withdraw from the World Health Organization, something we had talked about.  We had communicated to Congress, even in the informal process, that this was our intention. The President – we formally did that from the State Department yesterday consistent with the President’s guidance.  We will work with Congress with respect to the appropriated funds.  We’ll get it right.  But the President has made very clear we are not going to underwrite an organization that has historically been incompetent and not performed its fundamental function.

我不打算談論第二個問題。 關於第一個問題，我們昨天已經通知國會山，我們打算退出世界衛生組織，這是我們之前已經談論過的。即使在非正式過程中，我們也已經向國會傳達了這是總統的意圖。我們昨天按照總統的指示從國務院正式進行了這項工作。我們將在撥款方面與國會合作。我們做的是正確的，但是總統已經明確表示，我們不會為曆史上無能為力且未履行其基本職能的組織提供擔保。

There’s a real focus on the failures that took place around Wuhan and the World Health Organization’s fundamental inability to perform its basic core mission of preventing a global pandemic spread.  But don’t forget the history.  This is an institution that got it wrong on SARS, it got it wrong on Ebola.  The United States had to create its own system, PEPFAR, to do the work to prevent and come up with solutions to the HIV/AIDS problem.  We did that.  The United States did that.

真正應該关注的是武汉周圍發生的失敗，以及世界衛生組織根本無法履行其預防全球瘟疫的基本核心任務。不要忘記曆史。這是一家在SARS上已經做錯的機搆，在伊波拉病毒上也做錯了。美國必須建立自己的PEPFAR系統來開展工作，以預防艾滋病毒/艾滋病并提出解決方案。我們做到了。美國做到了。

The World Health Organization has a long history of corruption and politicization.  And it’s not that it doesn’t get some pieces of their program right.  That’s certainly true.  But on balance, this is an organization that has not been able to deliver on its core mission for decades.

世界衛生組織的腐敗和政治化曆史悠久。這并不是說它的某些程序不正確。這是絕對的事實。但總的來說，這是一個數十年來一直無法實現其核心使命的組織

We tried, Nick, desperately, and we in fact got some reforms through back a handful of years ago.  But the WHO leadership clearly has been unable to execute and implement them in a way that can prevent the kind of global pandemic that has destroyed hundreds of thousands of lives and cost the global economy trillions and trillions of dollars.  That is not an organization that the administration has any intention of underwriting.

尼克，我們努力嘗試了，實際上，前几年我們也進行了一些改革。但顯然世衛組織的領導人沒有能力執行和實施這些措施，以預防像現在這種全球性的流行病摧毀數百萬的生命和全球數億萬的經濟損失。這個組織的主管們连一点保險意識都沒有。

MS ORTAGUS:  Marina, go ahead.

瑪麗亞娜，請提問。

QUESTION:  Sir, about Brazil.  Do you think President Jair Bolsonaro should change his approach to the virus now that he has tested positive?  And also, when will U.S. allow people who are traveling from Brazil to enter the country?  Is there a number of cases or deaths that Brazil needs to reach in order to that?

問：關於巴西。您是否認為總統賈巴爾·塞納多在已經測試對病毒呈陽性后應該改變其應該改變對這種病毒的治療方法？而且，美國何時才能允許從巴西旅行的人進入該國？為此，巴西是否需要處理一些案件或死亡？

SECRETARY POMPEO:   So President Bolsonaro’s perfectly capable of making his own decision about how to proceed with the health situation in his own country.  I spoke with the Foreign Minister Araujo yesterday about that and many other things with respect to our relationship.  They are a great partner and friend of ours.

因此，博爾索納羅總統完全有能力自行決定如何應對自己國家的衛生狀況。昨天，我與外交部長阿勞霍談了有關我們關系的其他問題。我們是很好的合作伙伴和朋友。

As for when we can get travel back open between our two countries, the relationship with Brazil’s no different than any other country.  We are putting in place a set of metrics that will determine when it’s appropriate and safe for the American people to allow travel to come from other countries.  We’ll evaluate each country separately and make informed decisions based on science and reason, not politics.  We’re going to get this right.  We’re going to make sure that we do everything we can to get our economy back open just as quickly as we can.  We have a big team here at State.  We have a big team at Department of Transportation and DHS, the Vice President’s task force all looking at this challenge.  We want to get international travel back up and going just as quickly as we can.  That includes with our great friends in South America, including Brazil.

至於何時重開兩國間的旅行禁令。我們與巴西的關系與其他任何國家一樣。我們正在制定一套指標，以決定美國人民何時何地適合和安全地來往其他國家旅行，我們將分別評估每個國家/地區，并根據科學和理性而非政治做出明智的決定。我們將做對這一點。我們將確保盡我們所能，盡快恢復經濟。我們在州立有一支很大的團隊。我們在運輸部和國土安全部擁有一支龐大的團隊，副總統的工作组都在应对这一挑战。我们希望尽快恢复国际旅行。其中包括与我们在南美（包括巴西）的好友。

MS ORTAGUS:  Christian.

克里斯丁。

QUESTION:  Thanks, Mr. Secretary.  A couple of questions.  First on COVID, curious if we could get some updates on the negotiations to end the travel restrictions with the European Union.

And then secondly, you said yesterday the administration’s looking at banning TikTok.  I’m curious how serious this ban consideration is.  India banned it almost overnight with very little thought.  And how soon can we expect that to go into effect?

問：謝謝國務卿。我有几個問題。首先新冠病毒，我想知道，就終止與歐盟的旅​​行限制的談判有何最新進展？其次，您昨天說過，政府正在考慮禁止抖音。我非常想知道禁的嚴重性？考慮到印度几乎在一夜之間就禁止使用抖音了了。我們的這項禁令預計多久會生效?

SECRETARY POMPEO:  So with respect to the conversations with the EU, we’ve actually made some progress thinking about how to do that.  So it’s unlikely to be the case that it will be on and off – that is, we will attempt to put in some procedures and protocols that protect both citizens here in the United States from the spread.  And it’s a global challenge and we want to make sure that the European citizens aren’t impacted adversely by travel from the West as well.  Lots of people not only come from America but transit through America to Europe, so we’ve got to deal with all the complexity that comes with it.

在與歐盟的對話方面，我們實際上在考慮如何做到這一點上取得了一些進展。因此，開啟和關閉的可能性不大，也就是說，我們將嘗試制定一些程序和協議，以保護美國境內的兩國公民不會受病毒傳播影響。這是一項全球性挑戰，我們希望確保歐洲公民也不會受到來自西方國家的旅行的不利影響。許多人不僅來自美國，而且從美國過境到歐洲，因此我們必須處理隨之而來的所有復雜性。

We’ve made some real progress, technical progress, and now we need to draw that to a conclusion.  And then there will be a system, a system to monitor and measure, to make sure that we get the timing right and we get the toggle switches right.  Both sides of the Atlantic want to get this back open.  Both sides understand that our economies depend on it, the deep important relation, the transatlantic relationship matters.  These are two Western democracies that have a lot of good work to do together and getting those travel nodes hooked back up and connected again is an important thing.

我們已經取得了一些實際的進步，技朮上的進步，現在我們需要得出一個結論，并創建一個系統，一個用於監控和測量的系統。以確保我們在正確的時間正確地打開開關。大西洋兩岸都希望重新開放。雙方都理解我們的經濟都有賴於此。跨大西洋的合作關系事關重大。兩個西方民主國家還有很多共同工作要做。將這些旅行節點重新連結起來是很重要的。

With respect to TikTok, I want to put it in the broader context.  We have been engaged in a constant evaluation about ensuring that we protect the privacy of American citizens and their information as it transits, so this doesn’t relate to any one particular business or company but rather to American national security, and we are striving to get that right.  The comments that I made about a particular company earlier this week fall in the context of us evaluating the threat from the Chinese Communist Party.  We’ve talked about it in the context of ZTE, we’ve talked about it in the context of Huawei, and we are now evaluating each instance where we believe that U.S. citizens’ data that they have on their phones or in their system or in their health care records – we want to make sure that the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t have a way to easily access that.

關於抖音，我想以一個更大的背景來討論。我們一直在評估怎樣保護美國公民的隱私，以及在信息傳輸中保護個人信息。這與任何一個特定的企業和公司無關，這事關美國的國家安全。為此我們一直在努力。本周早些時候我對某家公司的評論，是在我們評估來自中共的威脅的背景下提出的。我們已經對中興的問題進行了討論，我們也就華為的問題進行了討論，現在我們對每個案例進行評估。對於美國公民手機上、系統上、或醫療紀錄中的個人數據，我們要確保中共無法輕易獲得。

And so what you’ll see the administration do is take actions that preserve and protect that information and deny the Chinese Communist Party access to the private information that belongs to Americans.  We have a – it’s a big project because we’ve got partners all around the world where infrastructure crosses Chinese technology and then comes to the United States, so one should think about this as a project of real scale and real importance.  We must get this right.  The infrastructure of this next hundred years must be a communications infrastructure that’s based on a Western ideal of private property and protection of private citizens’ information in a transparent way.  That is not the model that Chinese Communist Party software and hardware companies are engaged in.

因此，你會看到我們政府將釆取措施來保存和保護這些信息，嚴防中共對美國人的私人信息的入侵。我們有一個重大的項目，因為我們在世界各地都有合作伙伴，他們的基礎設施都與中國技朮有關，然后進入美國。因此，我們必須將其視為具有實質規模和重要性的項目。我們必須把這個項目做好。未來一百年的基礎設施建設必須是基於私有財產和以公開透明的方式保護公民隱私的西方價值理念。不是中共的軟件和硬件公司所釆用的模式。

MS ORTAGUS:  Hudson.

哈德遜。

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

問：謝謝國務卿先生！

SECRETARY POMPEO:  Hi.

蓬佩奧：你好。

QUESTION:  Disparate countries —

問：不同的國家……

SECRETARY POMPEO:  You look like you’ve got a great question – just all over your face.  (Laughter.)  I can just see it.

蓬佩奧：你看起來好像要提出一個不錯的問題，從你的臉上我都可以看到。

QUESTION:  I try to bring some Midwest optimism to all (inaudible).

問：我想問一些關於中西部地區……

SECRETARY POMPEO:  Fantastic.  That’s awesome.  Me too.  (Laughter.)

蓬佩奧：太好了，我也是……

QUESTION:  Good.  Good.

So disparate countries from Taiwan to Germany have managed to flatten the curve, but the U.S. has the highest number of cases of COVID in the world.  Do you still believe the U.S. is a world leader on the pandemic?

And just to put it directly, was the U.S. involved in any way in the Natanz explosion?

問：好的，好的。你知道，從台灣到德國，不同的國家都已經設法使曲線變平，但美國是全球新冠病毒病例最多的國家。您是否仍然相信美國是全球抗擊疫情大流行的領導者？讓我們直接地說，美國是否以任何方式參與了納坦玆的爆炸事件？

SECRETARY POMPEO:  Take your first question – of course the U.S. remains the world leader in the pandemic.  It almost goes without saying, and there are multiple dimensions and I’ve talked about each of them.  Certainly the Vice President’s task force talks about them as well.  But whether that is the technical, scientific solutions both to how to stop the spread; whether that’s therapeutics or vaccines, the world turns its eyes to the best scientists and researchers and practitioners of the sciences that will ultimately bring resolution to this problem.

蓬佩奧：關於你的第一個問題，美國依然是全球抗疫的領袖，這一點無庸置疑。這是一個多維度的問題，我已對每个维度討論過了。當然，副總統的特別工作組也討論過這些問題。但是，無論從技朮上還是科學上，都是解決了如何阻止病毒繼續傳播的問題，全世界的眼光都投向最優秀的科學家、研究人員和科學從業者。相信他們最終會很快地找到解決方案。

It’s the United States that the world looks to.  When it comes to countries, small countries, whether that’s in Central Asia or in Africa, their eyes turn to the United States.  It’s not remotely close who has provided the most assistance to these nations to try and solve what are vexing problems in their countries with very little medical infrastructure.  And so yes, there is no doubt that the United States has been and will remain the world’s leader when it comes to not only pandemic response but global health care infrastructure, systems, and processes that take down the very risks that we described.

全世界都期待着美國。當談到國家，無論是中亞還是非洲的小國，他們的目光都轉向美國​​。在為這些國家提供最大的援助、并試圖解決棘手的問題方面，美國做出的貢獻是無國能及的。在這些缺乏醫療基礎設施的國家和地區，是的，毫無疑問，美國不僅是，而且仍將是全球領導者，而且不僅是在病毒大流行的應對處理上，更是我們對全球衛生保健基礎設施系統的建設，以及我們提到的那些降低危險所釆取的一系列措施上。

It’s good we have friends and partners in this too.  The Western democracies – that model is the one that is most likely to prevail and prevent this kind of thing from happening again.  What we found in China is the Chinese Communist Party was simply incapable – and you see it with the arrest that I referred to in my remarks – they’re incapable of being transparent, of accepting criticism, of allowing reporters to ask them questions that they find uncomfortable that elicit the truth and the facts.  We still have significant questions about who patient zero was.  We’re now six months on at least from when this began and the Chinese Communist Party – that authoritarian model – simply can’t prevent the kind of inquiry or has to prevent that kind of inquiry because they’re afraid.  They’re afraid that the truth will be something that will not shine a happy light on what took place, and so instead they chose to hide and obfuscate and deny basic truth, basic scientific truths about what took place.  This is the – this is a fundamental and fatal flaw for authoritarian regimes and it’s why the Chinese Communist Party has to be held accountable.

幸運的是，在這些方面我們還有朋友和合作伙伴。西方民主國家的模式，是最有可能盛行，并阻止類似此次疫情的再次發生的模式。我們發現中共在中國的無能。你可以從我的講話中提到的逮捕事件中看到，他們沒有能力做到透明，他們無法容忍批評，也不允許記者問任何讓他們不舒服的問題，任何可能引出真相和事實的問題。對於誰是零號病患，我們仍然有很多重大疑問。你知道，病毒開始后至少六個月，中共獨裁政權都無法停止這樣的質問，或者因为害怕而阻止这样的質問。他们害怕揭示真相，担心真相不是那么光彩，相反他们选择了混淆视听、否认基本事实和否认基本的科学事实。这是独裁政权的致命缺陷。这就是为什么中共必须对此承担责任。你的第二个提问关于纳坦兹爆炸事件，我没有什么可以回答的。

QUESTION:  Do you think the Israelis were involved?

問：您認為以色列人參與了嗎？

SECRETARY POMPEO:  I just don’t have any comment.  Thanks.

蓬佩奧：對此我不做評論，謝謝。

MS ORTAGUS:  Victor, go ahead.

維克多，請提問。

QUESTION:  Thank you.  Now, on the visit of the Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the Mexican delegation has been clear that they want to (inaudible) coronavirus, but I’d like to know if you will put on the table issues like the human rights or human trafficking, your concerns on freedom of the press, for example.  And if I may, I’d like to know the status of the Merida Initiative and the need to upgrade or review the cooperation on antinarcotics or security, especially after the attack to a Mexican official in Mexico City.

問：謝謝。 現在，在墨西哥總統安德烈斯·曼努埃爾·洛佩玆·奧夫拉多爾的訪問中，墨西哥代表團已經明確表示他們想（聲音不清）冠狀病毒，但我想知道您是否會把諸如人權或販賣人口之類的問題放到明面上，例如您對新聞自由的關注。 而且，如果可以的話，我想知道《梅里達倡議》的現況，以及是否需要升級或審查在禁毒或安全方面的合作，特別是在墨西哥城一名墨西哥官員遭到襲擊之后。

SECRETARY POMPEO:  Yeah.  So it’s the President’s meeting.  He’ll put on the table precisely what he chooses to, and I’m sure President Obrador will do that as well, but I’m confident the meeting will talk about the full range of issues that we work on with the Mexican Government, certainly the economic issues.  We want to talk about our border, how we make sure that we keep that border, that commercial traffic up and successful, very important to American supply chains, Canadian supply chains that you can see come into full force under the USMCA.  We’ve got to make sure we get that right, and so I know they’ll talk about that.

蓬佩奧：他在總統會議上明確表達了他的觀點，我相信奥夫拉多尔总统也会这样做。但我相信，这次会议将讨论我们与墨西哥政府合作的所有问题。当然经济问题也是我们想要讨论的。如何确保边境、社区、商业交往畅通和成功，是非常重要。美国的供应链，加拿大的供应链，都将在美墨加协议下全部生效。我们必须确保这一点是正确的。所以我知道他们会讨论这些，我们相信是全方位的。

I’m confident that the full range of issues – I’m sure we’ll talk about issues that aren’t – that expand beyond bilateral as well, things in the hemisphere, right: what’s taking place in Venezuela today, challenges that we find to narcotics trafficking on – in both the Pacific and the Atlantic, places where Mexico can help.  So I’m confident that the full range of issues you asked – you mentioned several others.  I’m very confident that the discussion will be complete and comprehensive.  I expect we’ll have a good set of meetings with him today in the afternoon and then again this evening at the working dinner as well.

With that, I’ve got time for one more.

我相信我們也會討論一些超出雙邊關系的問題。今日委內瑞拉位於的半球上，太平洋和大西洋地區的毒品交易是我們面臨的挑戰，墨西哥能提供幫助。因此對你提出的所有問題我充滿信心。你還提到了其它一些問題。我非常有信心，此次討論將會是完整和全面的。我預期我們將在今天下午與他有一系列會議，以及今晚的工作晚宴上再次會面。

好了，我還可以回答一個問題。

MS ORTAGUS:  Lalit, go ahead.

拉利特，請提問。

QUESTION:  Thank you, Secretary.  Following up on your remarks about Beijing’s pattern of instigating boundary dispute, you know what has happened with – to India, China’s aggression, behavior against India in Leh, in Ladakh.  What is the – what is the assessment of the situation between India and China right now?

問：…您對引發邊界爭端的看法。您知道在印度發生了什么，您對中國最近針對印度和內陸拉達克的行為，當前的形式、印度與中國之間的局勢有何評價？

SECRETARY POMPEO:  So I’ve spoken with Foreign Minister Jaishankar a number of times about this.  The Chinese took incredibly aggressive action.  The Indians have done their best to respond to that.  I’d put this in the context of General Secretary Xi Jinping and his behavior throughout the region, and indeed, throughout the world.  It’s – I don’t think it’s possible to look at that particular instance of Chinese Communist Party aggression in isolation.  I think you need to put it in the larger context.

蓬佩奧：關於這個問題，我已多次與外交大臣尚卡爾討論過。中共釆取了令人難以置信的侵略行動，印度人竭盡全力對此做出回應。我把習近平總書記和他在該地區以及世界范圍內的行為聯系起來，作為對此事評估的背景，我不認為這次中共的入侵是一個孤立的事件。我認為你需要將其放到一個更大背景下來看。

When I was up here once before, we talked about the number of both maritime and boundary disputes that the Chinese Communist Party has engaged in.  I think it’s unequaled anyplace else in the world.  There aren’t many neighbors that could satisfactorily say that they know where their sovereignty ends and that the Chinese Communist Party will respect that sovereignty.  That’s certainly true now for the people of Bhutan as well.

之前我在這里講過中共的海上和國界爭端數量，我認為超過了世界上任何一個國家和地區。几乎沒有多少鄰國能滿意地說出自己的主權邊界在哪里，且令中共會給予尊重。對於不丹人民，現在更是如此。

This is what the world must come together to respond to.  This increasing revisionist effort that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in is something that President Trump has taken incredibly seriously.  The United States hadn’t done that in previous administrations.  We will respond to this in a way that we think is appropriate, and we have attempted to communicate to the Chinese leadership that we are serious about this.  When I say “we,” it’s not just the United States.  We will start very shortly a dialogue with our EU friends on how we collectively can respond to this challenge from the Chinese Communist Party.

這是全世界必須齊心協力應對的問題。中共釆取的這種越來越多的修正主義行為，是川普總統非常重視的事情。美國的前几屆政府對此都沒有作為。我們以我們認為適當的方式對此做出了回應。我們試圖向中共領導人傳達我們的重視，當我說到我們時，指不僅僅是美國。我們將很快開始與我們的朋友進行對話，討論如何共同應對來自中共的挑戰。

And I am confident, I’m confident that this – I think what’s happened with the spread of this virus from Wuhan, China – I think the world has seen the true colors of the Chinese Communist Party, and I am convinced more than ever that the free peoples of the world will come to understand the threat that’s presented not only internally inside of China, but importantly, that the impact that General Secretary Xi has on the world is not good for free peoples and democracy-loving peoples, and the world will come together to respond to that in a way that is powerful and important and will preserve sovereign nations operating under the rule of law in the way that we have all come accustomed to and benefits people all across the world.

我認為，伴隨着來自中國武漢病毒的傳播，背后一定發生了什么。我相信現在全世界都已經看到了中共的真面目。我比以往任何時候都更加堅信，世界上自由的人們都將認識到威脅不僅存在中國內部，更重要的是，習近平總書記對世界的影響，不利於熱愛自由和民主的人們。全世界應團結起來，以一種強大而重要的方式來應對這樣問題，在法治精神的指導下捍衛國家主權，以符合我們普世價值的方式惠及全世界人民。

MS ORTAGUS:  Okay.

好。

QUESTION:  May I do a follow-up on —

問：我可以繼續問嗎？

SECRETARY POMPEO:  Thank you.  I’m sorry, I’m going to have to take off.  Thanks, everybody.  Have a good day.

蓬佩奧：謝謝！對不起，我必須離開了。謝謝大家！
