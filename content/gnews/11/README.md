在2021年1月13日的盖特视频中，郭文贵先生就川普总统的弹劾案讲述中共和美国的叛国贼将要毁掉川普总统，使他不会有未来，还会把MAGA定义成恐怖组织。所有用在郭先生身上的招数都会全数用在川普总统身上，那是世界上所有邪恶势力的惯用招数。中共正在用3F计划毁掉美国。

**中英文对照全文**

Besides, brothers and sisters, everyone is anxiously watching the US House of Representatives and Senate impeaching President Trump right now. I told the people near President Trump a week ago. I said, “Remember, in the following week…” That was a week ago. I said, “In 2024, President Trump…” I said, “Let me tell you, they will definitely make you… if you leave the White House, they will make sure that you’ll never have a chance in 2024. And they will define your MAGA as a terrorist group.” It was more than a week now … It was before January 6, actually on January 2 when I said this. This is the first point.

另外兄弟姐妹们，大家都在紧张地看着现在美国众议院、参议院现在正在弹劾川普总统。川普总统在一星期前，我跟他旁边朋友、旁边人说，我说：你记住，接下来一个星期…大概一星期前，我说：2024川普总统 … 我说：告诉你，一定让你 … 如果你离开了白宫，一定让你永远不能有2024的机会，把你的MAGA定成恐怖犯罪集团。 这已经超过一个星期了… 就是一月六号以前，就一月二号我说的。这是一个。

Now, the second point. I said, “President Trump, they will impeach you or investigate your tax or suspect you of some economic crime.” “In China, these sort of things”, I said, “it’s not because I, Miles Guo, know better, anyone in China including those who sell candied haws, our cleaners and dishwashing staff at Pangu all know this trick, know how they will frame you, right? They will investigate your tax, and your relationships, right? And then you will be found to have committed economic crimes, involved with ganglands and told lies. Then you will be suspected of rape, attempted rape which only lasted for three seconds, right?” All of these tricks used on me, Miles, can be used as a textbook. I, Miles Guo, has personally proved to the world that this is not only the CCP’s usual trick.

第二个，我说：川普总统，弹劾你或者是税务调查你，或者你涉嫌什么经济犯罪。我说：这是在中国呀，不是我郭文贵水平高，我说上中国随随便便卖糖葫芦的，我们的清洁工，我们盘古的刷盘子的都懂这一套。咋弄呢？是吧？查你的税、有男女关系…是吧？然后你经济犯罪、涉黑、撒谎不诚实。然后涉嫌强奸，然后强奸未遂还三秒，对吧？这些招儿所有用在我文贵的招儿，都可以当教科书用，我用我郭文贵本人证明给了全世界。

This is the common trick of all the evil groups and evil politics in the world. This is the common trick of all evil people in the world. It’s not only happening this year, or in the last 70 years in China. It has existed on Earth right since the beginning where human beings have been living for 10,000 years. This is the concrete symbol of justice and evil. It is a basic means, isn’t it? All bad people know how to use these approaches. I said, not only this, they will induce you to commit crimes via your MAGA, or plant agents to get you to commit crimes, like in Hong Kong, like in the Tiananmen Square protests, like during the Cultural Revolution, like how they treated Peng Dehuai, Liu Shaoqi and the Kuomintang.

它不仅仅是共产党的惯用招数，这是世界上邪恶集团、邪恶政治一惯的招数。这是世界上邪恶的人一惯用的手法，不是今年，不是70年在中国。 人类在1万年的地球上，从开始就有，这是正义和邪恶的具体象征。它这个基本手段，对吧？谁是坏人都走这些招儿，我说：不但如此，把你MAGA给你诱使让你犯罪，或者掺沙子让你犯罪，像在香港，像在六四，像在文化大革命，像对待彭德怀、刘少奇，像对待国民党。

In my earliest broadcasts, I mentioned the CCP’s 3F plan more than once, including their specific approaches, which are controlling the US with the US, messing up the US economy with the US currency, messing up the US with the US technology. Now you see it’s Americans screwing Americans, right? American technology screwing Americans, right? Use the American dollars to mess up the American economy, right? And what the CCP believes to be the strongest (weapon) against the US is not nuclear weapon. What is the core then? It is social media, followed by the US dollar economy, and then the virus, and the unrestricted warfare. They all have happened. In the last few days, many … Yesterday, several of my American friends said, “Miles, you’re all correct. You’re like god! It’s so incredible!” I was not interested in listening at all. I did not want anyone to use these to prove how great I am because human beings have paid a price too high.

然后我最早在直播中，不止一次说共产党3F计划，包括具体手段，以美制美，以美元搞乱美国经济，以美国的科技搞乱美国。然后你看这是美国人搞美国人吧？美国人的科技搞美国人吧？以美元搞美国经济吧？然后共产党相信的现在对待美国最强大的不是核武器，最核心的什么？社交媒体。然后才是美元经济，然后才是所谓病毒、超限战。全发生了。 这几天很多 … 昨天我给几个美国朋友说：“Miles 你全说对了，你简直是神啊，太不可思议了。” 我一点兴趣都没有听进去，我不想任何人在这方面说，用此证明我伟大，因为人类付出的代价太大了。

The greed, hatred, delusion, arrogance and doubt of human beings, when they reach their extreme and turn to evil in the end, you will see what you see today. The CCP attacks Miles. The CCP and the traitors of America attack President Trump and the American people, ruling the country with falsehood. America is ruled with falsehood at the moment. The country is ruled by gangland. Can everyone see that clearly? What is in the core of all these? Fighting against corruption with corruption. All of these are under the signboard of three words: it’s good for you … democracy, rule of law. It’s always this, rule of law… rule of law… It’s good for you, justice, upholding the rule of law, maintaining the safety of the people and human beings. It’s always that this is good for you, democracy and rule of law. How many years have we been treated like this? For 70 years already, 100 years strictly speaking! It started since 1317. It was already budding in 1313. We’ve been cheated till today, so pathetic, detestable and regretful, but not funny at all.

人类的贪、嗔、痴、慢、疑，最终走到极端的时候，走到邪恶的时候，就是用今天你看到的这些。共产党对付文贵，和共产党和美国的叛国贼们，对付川普总统和对付美国的人民，以假治国。现在美国是以假治国，以黑治国，以黑治国。大家看清楚了吗？最核心的是什么？以贪反贪，所有这些名义都打着三个词儿，为你好…民主、法制。都是这个，法制..法制..为你好公平嘛，维护法制嘛，维护人类的安全、人民的安全嘛，永远是这样为你好，民主法制。 我们被这样对待了多少年？70年了，严格讲100年了，从1317年就开始了，1313年也有萌芽了，骗到今天了，可悲、可恨，真是可叹，但是一点也不可笑。

This is why we say we want ‘the rule of righteousness in the land’. When you say “I want democracy! I want rule of law!”, and when you fight for justice, do you have the capability to enjoy democracy, rule of law and justice? Do you possess the quality to comprehend what democracy, rule of law and justice mean? Do not think that democracy means ‘yours is mine and mine is also mine’? ‘Yours is mine and mine is mine’, this is called selfishness. What do you think justice means? Does it mean that you should have everything that other people possess? You cannot have bad things that other people have? I cannot lose a leg or be disabled like other people do? But I can make you … That person’s nose is pretty. I want it too. That is not called justice. And that is not what you truly own. That will be a disaster, that is called greediness. Everyone wants to be the emperor. Everyone wants to be the pope. Everyone wants to assault women without going to jail. That is not called the rule of law. What direction human beings should pursue really?  Our ‘rule of righteousness in the land’ has a very simple interpretation. Telling truth from falsehood, telling the good from the evil. The difference between good and evil is a standard that the majority agree upon. The difference between truth and falsehood should based on scientific and physical evidence. A stone is a stone. A stone is not an egg.

这就是为什么我们说要正道主义？一张口我要民主！我要法制！一闹我要公平，你具不具备享受民主、享受法制、享受公平的能力？你是否具备理解民主法制和公平的这个素质？你别以为你的是我的，我的是我的是民主，你的是我的，我的是我的。这叫自私。你以为啥叫公平？人家有的你都的有？人家有的坏东西，你不能有。人家缺个腿，残废，我不能有，但是我可以让你..那个人鼻子很漂亮，我要有。那不叫公平，那也不是真正你所拥有，那是灾难，那是贪婪，每个人都想当皇帝，每个人都想当教宗，每个人都想搞双修不犯法，那不叫法制。真正的一个人类所追求的走向是什么？咱们正道主义说的非常简单，真和假的分别，善和恶的分别。善和恶的分别是让所有的人们，绝大多数都认同的标准，真和假的分别是有科学和物理现象。石头是石头，石头不是鸡蛋。
