**宾州立法机构正式决议，要求州务卿撤回大选认证**

The PA Legislature has formally resolved to ask the Secretary of State to withdraw the election certification

该决议称，州行政和司法部门篡夺了美国宪法赋予立法机构的制定选举规则的权力；敦促州务卿撤回对总统选举结果的过早认证，并推迟其他选举的认证；宣布2020年大选结果是有争议的。

The resolution stated that the executive and judicial departments of the state usurped the power granted to the legislature by the U.S. Constitution to make election rules; urged the Secretary of State to withdraw the premature certification of the presidential election results and to delay the certification of other elections; and then declared the results of the 2020 election  to be controversial.

**宾州行政和司法部门如何篡权更改选举规则？**

How did the PA executive and judicial departments usurp the power to change election rules?

9月17日，宾州最高法院非法且单方面地延长了接受邮寄选票的最后期限，规定没有邮戳的邮寄选票可被视为及时选票，并允许接受签名未经核实的选票。

On Sep 17, the PA Supreme Court illegally and unilaterally extended the deadline of mailed-in votes, stipulating that mailed-in votes without postmarks could be regarded as timely votes, and accepting votes with unverified signatures.

10月23日，宾州最高法院根据州务卿的请求，裁定邮寄选票上的签名不需要经过验证。

On Oct 23, on request of the Secretary of State, the PA Supreme Court ruled that the signatures on the mailed-in votes could not to be verified.

11月2日，州务卿鼓励某些县在发现邮寄选票有缺陷后，通知政党和邮寄选民的候选人代表。

On Nov 2, the Secretary of State encouraged some counties to notify political parties and candidate representatives of mailed voters when they discover flaws on mailed-in votes.

**州选举结果是如何认证的？**

How are state election results certified?

州选举结果必须由政府和立法机构同时认证才有效，州政府认定是由州务卿具体负责认证、然后交州长签字确认。如果双方意见不一致，要么打官司到联邦法院进行判决，要么该州放弃选举认证。如果该州放弃认证，川普和拜登都不能获得本州的选举人票。

State election results must be certified by the government and legislature at the same time. The Secretary of State is responsible for the certification and then submits it to the Governor for signature at the state government. Shall there be any disagreement, either a lawsuit is filed in a federal court, or the state abandons the election certification. If it is the latter one, neither Trump nor Biden can get the state’s electoral votes.

**川普法律团队的四线作战**

The four-front battles of Trump’s legal team

这四条战线的法律战，只要有一处获胜，川普就获胜：起诉作废无法监票的选票，宾州翻盘；起诉作废所有州邮寄选票；起诉的Dominion选举系统造假；秘密战线的刑事犯罪起诉。

Trump will win if one of the four-front legal battles wins: prosecuting to void  uncountable votes with PA’s flipping; prosecuting to void all state mailed-in votes; prosecuting Dominion election system fraud; prosecuting the criminal offenses on secret front.

**乔治亚州对外州人员在本州的投票进行调查**

GA investigates votes casted by out-of-staters

该州已经对一个名为“美国投票”的组织进行调查，该组织向1994年以来从未在该州居住过的人发送邮寄选票。在该州，非本州居民的非法投票属于重罪。该调查，为下一步该州不认证选举投票结果奠定了基础。

The state has started investigation on an organization called “America Votes”, who sent mailed-in votes to people that have never lived in the state since 1994. It is a felony to vote illegally by non-residents of the state there. The investigation has laid the foundation for the decertification election results of the state.

Joe Low’s Identity Revealed

刘特佐养母吴玉幼亲口说，刘特佐是孟建柱在文革时期，与情人（和其他男人）的私生女所生的儿子。孟建柱与其情人也生了一个女儿。

孟建柱因为其隐藏在东南亚的金钱，还没有全部被收回，所以暂未被抓捕，目前处于监视居住的状态。

**马六甲皇京港超级工程被叫停**

The Melaka Gateway super project halted

这个号称要取代新加坡港的、由中共投资的金额高达100亿美元的深水港码头工程，因为涉及中共军事用途，一直备受争议。在实际投资金额超过20亿美元后，近期被马六甲州政府以未能如期完成填海作业为由正式叫停。

The $10 billion deep-water gateway project, which was claimed to replace the Port of Singapore, has been controversial because of its military use by the CCP. After the actual investment amount exceeded $2 billion, the project was recently halted by the Melacca state government for failing to complete the refilling operation as scheduled.
