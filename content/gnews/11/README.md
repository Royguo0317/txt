**简述：郭文贵先生在2021年4月9日的直播中分析中共在红海、霍尔木兹海峡、苏运士运河、马六甲的一系列动作，最终目的是击垮美元，最直接的受害者是日本和印度。印度跟英国合作，日本和美国合作，最终各国合作灭掉共产党是唯一的选择。**

**英国、日本和印度是接下来对抗共产党的最核心力量**

**Britain, Japan, and India Will Be the Most Important Forces for Fighting the CCP**

这就是日本现在正在民间一个最大的民间开始爆发，都在思考谁是我们的威胁——共产党，中国人一定要成为我们的朋友，无论从经济、无论从文化、无论从军事、无论从地域都应该和中国人民友好相处，但是共产党在，日中友好的可能性是没有的。

Japanese people have started to think about who is their threat, which is the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). They believe that the Chinese people definitely are their friends, considering the economy, the culture, the military, and the location. However, as long as the CCP exists, there will be no possibility of Sino-Japanese friendship.

包括印度，现在印度，我跟大家说过。记住七哥一再说的话，印度在24小时以前我说过一句话，我说吉布提、红海，记得吧？我发盖特，盖特上我发完以后，吉布提的伊朗的船就给炸了，七哥第一个说的吧？你看上去以色列炸伊朗的船是一个军事船，在吉布提，这是一个所谓的冲突。大家千万别忘了，这里边儿都有着各种战略的一种行动的结果。

Now let me talk about India. I have told you before. Remember that I, Brother Miles have said this over and over again. About 24 hours ago, I talked about Djibouti and the Red Sea. Remember that? After I posted the Getter, the Iranian ship in Djibouti was blown up. Brother Miles was the first one who said this, right? It seemed that the ship bombed by Israel in Djibouti is an Iranian military ship and this was a so-called military conflict. But don’t forget, this is a result of various strategic actions.

为什么我说吉布提？吉布提现在四股力量在那儿，美国人多年来二战以后一直有军事基地，俄罗斯的军事基地、中共的军事基地、日本的军事补给基地全在那儿。伊朗人想参与，当然了它太近了，红海，是不是啊？霍尔木兹海峡、苏运士运河，咱简称吧就霍尔木兹海峡—马六甲供给线，几乎是亚洲的生命线。

Why did I mention Djibouti? There are four different driving forces in Djibouti now. The Americans have had military bases there for many years since World War II. The Russian military bases, the CCP’s military bases, and the Japanese military supply bases are all there. The Iranians also want to be a player because, for the obvious reason, it is too close. The area of the Red Sea, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Suez Canal – let’s just call it the Hormuz-Malacca Supply Line – is the lifeline of Asia.

共产党一带一路，要把人民币国际化，马六甲的供给线拿下，这就是它所有的一切嘛，就是新殖民主义嘛，是不是啊？就是大陆的文明要挑战海洋文明，从亚洲开始亚洲说了算，然后掐住全世界的能源供给线、掐住亚洲的供给线，它就说了算。然后制造亚币，制造亚洲的所有的现代化数字金融，控制全世界，干掉美元，就这一切嘛！

The CCP’s Belt and Road Initiative, the globalization of the RMB, and the seize of Malacca’s supply line, are everything that it [the CCP] wants. It’s essentially the neo-colonialism, right? It’s essentially the continental civilization challenging the maritime civilization. It [the CCP] will start this with dominating Asia first, and then it will snatch the energy supply lines of the world and the supply lines of Asia, so it can have the final say there. And then it will make Asian currencies, make all modern digital finances in Asia, control the world, and eventually get rid of the U.S. dollar. And that’s the whole plan!

吉布提这个地方是整个叫中东非最最关键的地方，第二个霍尔木兹海峡，也是马六甲海岸线最关键的能源补给基地。在这个地方的利益是什么，以色列很关键，以色列在那儿有重大的利益。伊朗想抢，伊朗后边儿是有共产党支持着呢。然后一拐过来叙利亚、戈兰高地，是吧？沙特、科威特是吧？就这些地方它必占！

Djibouti is the most critical place in the entire Middle East and Africa. The second one is the Strait of Hormuz, which is also the most critical energy supply base on the Malacca coastline. Whose interests are in this place? Israel is a key player, and it has significant interests there. Iran wants to seize it, and it has the CCP behind its back. And then Syria, the Golan Heights, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, right? It must occupy all these places!

所以共产党在这个地方它搞完苏运士运河、搞完马六甲、搞完这个大船，它接下来还会再搞，那再搞的时候就会把以色列和伊朗、沙特，把这所有的…特别是大家现在要看到的、伊朗的现在被美国解除制裁以后，这一切整个穆斯林世界会爆发起来。在这个里边儿就有一个以色列，以色列再跟中共之间不清不楚，这就热闹了。

So in this region, after the CCP screwed the Suez Canal, Malacca, and this big ship, it will do it again. When it does it again, it will stir up Israel, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, and everyone. You should especially see that after the sanctions on Iran are lifted by the U.S., the entire Muslim world will be stirred up. There is also Israel in this region, whose relationship with the CCP has been vague. So it will be really fun.

共产党最想的事情在此地造成麻烦，在此地造成能源争夺，能源争夺那就是局域性战争，局域性战争共产党就在中间有说数：这面儿跟着伊朗有一系列的千亿万亿的投资计划、能源天然气；这边儿跟沙特、跟阿联酋最大的、长期的、全天的24小时的特殊伙伴关系；然后在吉布提、中东非、安哥拉，安哥拉占了中国20%的能源供给，然后把这些全部控制；然后日本、印度就完球蛋了。

What the CCP wants the most is to create troubles in this region and to make everyone compete for energy in this region. Competing for energy will lead to a regional war, so the CCP can find leverages in the midst of all this. It can have a series of trillions of dollars of investment in Iran and purchase its oil and gas, and at the same time it can have the largest, long-term, 24-hour special partnership with Saudi Arabia and the UAE; and then it can control Djibouti, the Central and East Africa, Angola, which accounts for 20% of China’s energy supply, and after it controls all these, Japan and India will be finished.

它针对的是亚洲的日本和印度。日本和印度接下来会怎么办？日本和印度只要活下去，没有任何选择，必须和中共干！大家，要干的时候，千万别忘了，印度要想干的时候它一定联合英国，很多个人的话我就不说了，这有些秘密，只有咱局部战友知道，涉及到个人的问题。为什么这样？因为印度和英国之间的文化、法律、金融的联系，一定联英抗中；日本一定是联美抗中。

It targets Japan and India in Asia. Then what will Japan and India do next? As long as Japan and India want to survive, they have no choice but to fight against the CCP! Everyone, please don’t forget, when India is ready to fight, it must unite with Britain. (There are many things that I can’t say here. There are some secrets that I can only share within a small circle of our fellow fighters because of some privacy issues.) Why is that? Because of the cultural, legal, and financial ties between India and Britain, it [India] must be united with Britain to fight against China, and Japan must be united with the U.S. to fight against China.

在这种情况下大家要记住，英国、日本和印度是接下来抗共产党的最核心的，大家会看到一系列的奇怪的事情都会发生。较量在马六甲，最终打的是美元。美元在这个时候就热闹了。

In this case, everyone should remember that Britain, Japan, and India will be the most important forces for fighting the CCP. You will see that a series of bizarre things will happen. The competitions are in Malacca, but the target is the U.S. dollar. The fate of the U.S. dollar will be interesting by that time.

现在大家看到比特币，比特币就两个选择，一个是彻底被国家化，就是过去的最牛的就是秘密去中心化，找不着老板，所以大家是绝对洗钱、绝对的避税的一个最佳的货币。大家要看到所有的比特币它最大的使用的地方叫深网、非法的交易。大家记住那个犯罪组织 “丝绸之路” 当时在深网被查的时候，在深网比特币一下子就跌下去了，百分之几十的交易没了。现在的比特币就是中共控制的，中共控制的比特币就是要打击美元，就是在深网运作的，就是要洗黑钱。暗钱有比特币，明的数字货币有共产党的中央银行搞的虚拟货币叫人民币数字化的人民币。

Now, everyone has realized that there are only two options left for Bitcoin. One is to be completely nationalized. The best thing about it in the past is its secrecy and decentralization. Since no one can find the boss, it’s absolutely the best currency for money laundering and tax avoidance. Everyone should see that Bitcoins are most frequently used in a place called the deep web for making illegal transactions. Everyone should remember that when the criminal organization called Silk Road was investigated on the deep web, Bitcoin’s price fell suddenly, and tens of percent of transactions were gone. Bitcoin is currently controlled by the CCP. The CCP controls the Bitcoin in order to attack the U.S. dollar, it’s meant to be operated on the deep web, and it’s meant to launder money. So, under the ground there is Bitcoin, and above the ground there is the CCP’s virtual currency of the CCP’s central bank, called the digitalized RMB.

在这种情况下，美国现在想想，石油美元、石油被共产党干掉了、被共产党控制了，你还有美元吗？所有虚拟货币、比特币被共产党控制了，还有人民币数字化，你还有数字化美元吗？你没啦！然后你美元、你美国人现在你要跨过阿拉斯加给中共做油、做汽，你跟俄罗斯较量、你跟中东较量，你有机会吗？能源供给，你想磕头的机会都没有。因为它想要你的命，你磕头是没有用的。那这种情况下，美国能跟谁合作？美国只能跟日本、英国、印度去合作。合作前提是什么？他不能把14亿中国人给灭了哇，他只能灭掉共产党，这是没有选择的唯一选择。

Under such circumstances, the U.S. should think about the oil-based dollar. If the oil supply is destroyed by the CCP or controlled by the CCP, would there still be dollars? If all virtual currencies and Bitcoin are controlled by the CCP and the RMB is digitized, would still there be digitized dollar? No! When you, Americans, make oil and gas for the CCP across Alaska and compete with Russia and the Middle East, do you have a chance? You won’t have a chance even if you are willing to kowtow to it. If it [the CCP] wants your life, it’s useless for you to kowtow. In that case, who can the U.S. cooperate with? It can only collaborate with Japan, Britain, and India. What is the premise for this collaboration? It can only be taking down the CCP because it’s not possible to take down all 1.4 billion Chinese people. This is the only option when there are no other options.

这就是为什么你看到了现在拜登，你看到了拜登他可以给伊朗松绑，他绝对不会给病毒松绑。他可以在能源上给各国让步，他给共产党让步的可能性绝对没有。他给共产党什么都松绑，在美元地位上绝对不会松绑。这是为什么你看到制裁中共的这七家企业，七哥都不想多说了。七哥几年前就说了，它一定的，这一百多家国有大企业和三百六十多家的中概股企业，100%都得拿走。

This is why you see that Biden can let Iran get away, but he will never let the virus go. He is willing to compromise with other countries in terms of energy, but there is absolutely no possibility that he will compromise with the CCP. Even if he is willing to compromise with the CCP on certain things, he will never compromise on the position of the U.S. dollar. This is why you’ve seen the sanctions on seven enterprises of the CCP. I, your Brother Miles don’t want to say this again because I have said it a few years ago. There are more than one hundred large, state-owned enterprises and more than three hundred and sixty China Concept Stocks, and 100% of them will be kicked out of the U.S.

接下来，SWIFT 支付系统一定是被踢出中共的，一定美元支付踢出去。这是没有任何的…世界上的三大国际组织——WTO把它踢出去，IMF货币组织把它踢出去，世界银行要给它要钱要把它踢出去，这是一定的结局。然后你还相信有港币吗？你还相信有国际人民币吗？

Next, the SWIFT will definitely kick the CCP out of its system and stop it from using the U.S. dollars for any transactions. This is without question. Among the three major international organizations in the world, the WTO will kick the CCP out, the IMF will kick it out, and the World Bank will kick it out. This is a definite ending. Then do you believe Hong Kong dollars will still exist? Do you still believe there will be the internationalized RMB?
