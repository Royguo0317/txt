Another thing, about the many BIAs living in China who are in trouble. Their families have been kept from going outdoors and their residence areas have been completely cut off [by lockdown], that is to say, they can’t go outside, buy food, or make phone calls. Beloved brothers and sisters, for the BIAs I can help, I will say no more here. Those BIAs I can’t reach out to and help, to my brothers or sisters who are watching this video: if that BIA in trouble needs help, and you truly can provide the help that they need, no matter if it’s food, or medicine, or money you have helped them with, as long as it has really happened, Brother Seven, the ROLF and the ROLS will do our utmost to reimburse you.

另外一个，关于国内很多[遭难的]战友。就是[那些]在疫区，[他们自己]或者家人被关起来[的]。[他们所在的]小区所有的[与外界的沟通渠道]被封锁，已及[出现了]不能出门，不能买粮食，不能打电话等[情况]……亲爱的兄弟姐妹们，我能帮助的战友们，我就不在这[里]多说了。不能帮的和帮不到的，能看到这个视频的兄弟姐妹们，如果有战友需要帮助的话，[而且]你真的能帮助咱们战友的话。[你们帮的东西]无论是食品，无论是药，无论是钱。只要是事实，七哥，和法治基金、法制社会，会尽全力给你们报销。

Remember the words I’ve just said. Sincere and genuine help does not include additional living costs. If you buy diapers or video games, that doesn’t count. Things that count are medicines given when someone is in imperative conditions, or helping the BIA with other practical and effective measures, like the type of cost for caring and rescuing. As long as [the person you help is] a donator of ROLF or ROLS, or an investor of G Series, or a BIA who has been supporting the Whistleblower Movement for a long period of time, if you have helped these people who are in trouble, come to Brother Seven for your reimbursement. For contact information, check out Himalaya Embassy group’s Discord server, okay?

记住我现在说的话。真心的帮助，不包括生活设施。你买尿不湿，你打游戏机了，这不算数。[算数是指]在危机时刻的药，和对战友切实有效的帮助，包括救死扶伤的这[类]成本。只要是法治基金、法治社会的捐款者，和G系列的投资者，和长期支持爆料革命的战友。只要你帮助这些人，到七哥这[里]来报销。联络方式，到Discord喜马拉雅大使馆群，好不好？

As long as you can get in touch with the BIAs in trouble, one-on-one and confidentially. If both parties can confirm that it has happened, and you also have testimony of a witness and physical evidence, Brother Seven will think of ways to reimburse you. Is that okay? What has especially touched me was that some BIAs really wanted to help, but they didn’t have the money or the resources needed, and some even had to pay out of pocket. The money spent will be reimbursed by Brother Seven, but like what I’ve just said, it must follow the standards I’ve just set. Do remember clearly.

你只要联系上[落难战友]以后，单对单的，在保密的情况下。[如果]能证实，双方证实，有证据有人证，七哥想办法负责，中不中？特别让我感动[的是]，有些战友确实想帮，但没钱、没资源，有些要垫上。垫上的，七哥付。但是我说的是[这样]，一定是[按照]刚才的标准，记清楚啊。

The good days have long gone, and only when the new China comes shall they return. The bad days haven’t begun yet! The shortage of food, power, water and money, as well as the future outbreaks of the virus [will all come]. The worst time hasn’t come yet. Be mentally prepared for that!

好日子，早就过去啦。只有新中国到来的时候，才能回到好日子。坏日子，还没有开始呐！缺粮、缺电、缺水、缺钱，和病毒[的]再爆发[都可能来]。这个时候，最坏的时候，还没有到来呢。做好心理准备吧！
