> 3. **Homologous recombination. **Lines 18-19: The report states that the low sequence identity between beta coronavirus and other coronaviruses that contained a furin cleavage site would be too low to allow homologous recombination to occur. If recombination had occurred, it would not have had to have occurred in the immediate area of the sequence coding the furin cleavage site; it could occur in other, more homologous regions.


【评议者】

同源重组。第18-19行，报告表示，β冠状病毒和其他含有弗林酶切位点的冠状病毒之间的低序列一致性太低，不被允许发生同源重组。如果发生了重组，它就不必直接发生在弗林酶切位点序列的区域，它可以发生在其他更加同源的位置。


> Response: Warmbrod et al. are mistaken here because the scenario described by them is an impossible one.
> 
> In our report, we have reasoned that, since no Spike protein that contains a furin-cleavage site is more than 40% identical to SARS-CoV-2 Spike, recombination could not be responsible for the natural emergence of the furin-cleavage site (FCS) at the S1/2 junction. Here, Warmbrod et al. indeed agreed with this analysis of ours, admitting that recombination could not have occurred within the spike gene.
> 
> They then implied that recombination could have happened in a way that a region greater than just the spike gene is swapped in from an FCS-containing coronavirus, through which the FCS within Spike is acquired. However, when such a swap takes place because FCS-containing coronaviruses are highly divergent from the lineage B β coronaviruses that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to, the whole spike gene of SARS-CoV-2 must exhibit very low sequence similarity to the spike of other lineage B β coronaviruses while the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 genome share much higher sequence similarity with other lineage B β coronaviruses. However, the reality is that the S2 of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a similar level of divergence with other lineage B β coronaviruses as the rest of the genome does. Therefore, the scenario described by Warmbrod et al. is not possible. More importantly, it once again proves our point – this furin cleavage site could not have come from nature.
> 
> Consistent with the above notion, genetic evidence (tandem rare codons; FauI restriction site) also suggests that this FCS should have been inserted artificially. In fact, introducing a human protease-cleavage site into the Spike protein of coronaviruses to enable cross-species transmission into the human population has been proven by a study published in 2015 by Lanying Du, Shibo Jiang, Zhengli Shi, Ralph Baric, and Fang Li. Clearly, at that time, they have already acquired the most essential knowledge in Spike engineering:
> 
> “Viral adaptation to human cellular proteases is critical for viral infection of human cells because human cellular proteases, particularly endosomal proteases, are more reliable sources than some extracellular proteases to activate viral entry. Previous research also identified two mutations in the SARS-CoV spike that led SARS-CoV to transmit from palm civets to humans. These mutations increased the capability of the SARS-CoV spike to bind human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Thus, different entry factors appear to have played the most critical roles in the cross-species transmission of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV: adaption to human cellular proteases by MERS-CoV and adaption to the *human receptor by SARS-CoV.*“
> 
> Intriguingly, this understanding by the above experts has been precisely mirrored in the reality of SARS-CoV-2 Spike: having a designed and engineered RBM and an inserted human protease-cleavage site.


【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人在此犯错是因为他们所说的设想是不可能的。我们在报告里已经推论出，因为没有一种含有弗林酶切位点的刺突蛋白与新冠刺突蛋白的一致性超过40%，重组不可能导致S1/S2联接处的弗林酶切位点的自然出现。在此，沃姆布罗德等人实际上是同意了我们的分析，即承认了重组不可能在刺突基因里发生。

然后他们暗示，重组可能以这样一种方式发生，即一个大于刺突基因的区域被一个含有弗林酶切位点的冠状病毒替换进来，由此刺突就获得了弗林酶切位点。可是，当这样一个替换发生时，因为含弗林酶切位点的冠状病毒是与新冠所属的B系β冠状病毒高度不同的，在新冠的其他部分与其他B系β冠状病毒有很高一致性时，新冠的刺突基因却会显示出与它们很低的一致性。然而事实是，新冠的S2与其他B系β冠状病毒的差别与其他部分的差别一样。所以，沃姆布罗德等人所说的是不可能的。更重要的是，这再次证明我们的观点，这个弗林酶切位点不可能来自于自然。

与以上论点一致的是，基因证据（FauI限制性切位点上串联的稀有密码子）也说明弗林酶切位点理应是人工插入的。事实上，人类酶切位点引入冠状病毒刺突蛋白以实现跨种传播人类这一理论，已经在2015年被杜丽英、姜世勃、石正丽、拉尔夫-巴里克和李放发表的论文所证明。显然，在那时，他们就已经获得了刺突基因工程的关键知识：

“病毒适应人类细胞蛋白酶是病毒感染人类的关键，因为人类细胞酶，尤其是核内体的蛋白酶，是比细胞外蛋白酶更可靠的促成病毒入侵的资源。过去的研究也认定了，SARS刺突的两个变异导致SARS跨种从果子狸跳到人类。这些变异促进了SARS的刺突绑定人类细胞受体血管紧张素转化酶2。”

有趣的是，以上专家的理解已经被现实的新冠刺突准确地反映出来：拥有设计和工程改造的RBM和入侵人类蛋白酶的切位点。


> 1. **On methods of a literature review. **Typically, the scientific description of the steps to create a transmissible virus (as per the chart on page 15) would require biosecurity review before publication in a reputable scientific journal, as this is a dual-use concern, which has the potential to lower barriers toward biological weapons development. However, it should be noted that the steps described by Yan et al are not individually novel and, in our judgment, do not present a biological weapons risk, particularly as the methods chosen have been supplanted by more accurate genetic engineering tools.


【评议者】

关于一份文献的评论方式。科学地描述一个创造传染性病毒的典型步骤（像15页的每个图表）是，先进行生物安全评议，然后再发表在著名科学杂志上，这是也是有另一种顾虑，即可能降低发展生物武器的壁垒。然而，值得注意的是，闫等人描述的步骤并不独特新鲜，而且以我们的判断，并不具有生物武器的危险，尤其是他们选择的方法都已经被更精确的基因工程工具取代了。


> Response: This comment by Warmbrod et al. showcased their poor judgment and inability of logical thinking.
> 
> First, the experimental steps being novel or not has nothing to do with whether or not the postulated pathway is valid. There is no logical connection between the two; using novel methods is not a prerequisite for the creation of a novel pathogen.
> 
> Also, Warmbrod et al.’s description that other genetic engineering methods are more accurate than the ones presented in our report is mistaken. Both the traditional and the newer genetic engineering tools are accurate. Furthermore, as shown in our above responses, top experts in coronavirus research continue to use the methods we described in their work.
> 
> The pathway that we illustrated in our report was our postulative reconstruction of the laboratory creation of SARS-CoV-2, which was based on the genetic evidence we identified, literature support, as well as our expertise in virology, molecular biology, and structural biology.
> 
> Importantly, as implied in this review comment, Warmbrod et al. had to agree with our conclusion that the laboratory creation of SARS-CoV-2 is convenient and can be accomplished by following proven concepts and using established techniques. The validity of our postulated pathway is therefore irrefutable.
> 
> Second, in our first report, which Warmbrod et al. “reviewed” here, we had not, for once, described SARS-CoV-2 as a bioweapon. Note that, although we concluded SARS-CoV-2 as an unrestricted bioweapon in our second report, that report was published after Warmbrod et al. published this “peer review.” It is therefore interesting that Warmbrod et al. brought the term “bioweapon” out twice in this comment of theirs. Their denial of the possibility that this “bioweapon” (a term we never brought up in our first report) could be created in a lab using established methods is clearly baseless. However, the fact that they publicly stated this denial despite that it is baseless is intriguing. In fact, this comment of theirs may be the most important clue for uncovering Warmbrod et al.’s motives in “volunteering” as “peer reviewers” here.
> 
> Finally, as shown in their comment, it is their judgment that the postulated steps, which they essentially admit as valid and would successfully yield SARS-CoV-2, “do not present a biological weapons risk.” This judgment is clearly at odds with the reality, where SARS-CoV-2 had led to a worldwide pandemic, over 2 million deaths, and devastating social and economic disorders. Their judgment could not be poorer.
> 
> In our second report, we have defined SARS-CoV-2 as an unrestricted bioweapon, which was based on the evidence of lab creation, the planned cover-up by the CCP government before the initial outbreak, and the characteristics of COVID-19 disease. Importantly, we also described in section 4.3 there how SARS-CoV-2 meets all criteria of a bioweapon described in 2005 by a military bioweapon expert, Dr. Ruifu Yang:


【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人这条评议显示出他们低下的判断力和逻辑思考的无能。

首先，实验步骤新鲜不新鲜与假设的方法有效与否毫无关系。这两者间没有逻辑关系，用新的方法并不是制造一种新病毒的先决条件。

而且，沃姆布罗德等人说，其他基因工程的方法比我们报告里提供的更加准确也是错误的。传统的和新的基因工程工具都是准确的。更进一步的是，如我们前面的回应所示，顶级冠状病毒研究专家在他们的研究中仍继续使用着我们所说的方法。

我们报告里图示说明的方法是对实验室制造新冠的假设重建，这是基于我们认定的、文献支持的基因证据以及我们在病毒学、分子生物学和生物结构学上的专业知识。

重要的是，如评议中所暗示的，沃姆布罗德等人不得不同意我们的结论，即实验室制造新冠是便利的，并可基于已被证实的观点，用完善的技术来完成。所以，我们假设的方法的有效性无可辩驳。

第二，沃姆布罗德等人评议的关于我们第一篇报告中的部分，我们还没有一次把新冠称作生物武器。注意，在沃姆布罗德等人发表此同行评议之后，我们才发表了第二篇报告，其中总结新冠为超限生物武器。所以很有趣，是沃姆布罗德等人在他们的评议中两次用到了“生物武器”这个词汇。他们否认这“生物武器”（我们在第一篇报告中从未使用的词汇）可以在实验室里用完善的方法来制造，这显然是没有根据的。然而事实是，尽管毫无根据，他们还是公开否认，这更有趣。事实上，他们的评议是揭露沃姆布罗德等人“志愿地”充当“同行评议者”的动机的最重要的线索。

最后，如他们评议中所示，按他们的判断，即这些他们实质上承认是有效且能成功产生新冠的假定的步骤，并不造成生物武器的危险。这判断明显地与事实背道而驰。新冠已经造成全球大流行，导致超过两百万人死亡，以及不可估量的社会和经济混乱。他们的判断差劲到无以复加。

在我们第二篇报告里已经定义新冠是超限生物武器，那就是基于实验室制造的证据，和中共政府在初始爆发前的有计划的掩盖，以及新冠肺炎的各种特征。重要的是，我们在4.3中描述了为什么新冠符合2005年生物武器专家杨锐富所述的超限生物武器的所有标准：


> • *It is significantly virulent and can cause large scale casualty.*
> 
> • *It is highly contagious and transmits easily, often through respiratory routes in the form of aerosols. The most dangerous scenario would be that it allows human-to-human transmission.*
> 
> • *It is relatively resistant to environmental changes, can sustain transportation, and is capable of supporting targeted release.*
> 
> Among the four “peer reviewers” here, Nancy Connell and Gigi Gronvall both carry titles, which suggest that they are experts in biodefense. However, as evident in these comments, both of these “experts” are highly deficient in their knowledge in all relevant areas of biology: virology, molecular biology, structural biology, biochemistry, and evolutionary biology. It is also clear that they lack the ability of logical thinking and have very poor judgement. Not only they could not see the genetic, structural, evolutionary evidence that clearly show a laboratory origin of SARS-CoV-2, but also they failed miserably in recognizing SARS-CoV-2 as a bioweapon when it meets the criteria and has fundamentally disrupted the world’s social and economic orders. Connell and Gronvall are clearly not what their titles suggest. They are completely incompetent and far behind their times.


【闫博士】（接上）

•它有显著的毒性，能引起大范围伤亡。

•它高度可感染和易传播，通常通过呼吸道以气溶胶的形式。最危险的情况是能够人传人。

•它比较能适应环境变化，能够被携带，能支持定点靶向的散播。

在四位评议者中，南希-康奈尔和吉吉-格龙瓦尔都有着生化防御专家的头衔。然而如评议所示，这些专家们在相关的生物领域，即病毒学、分子生物学、生物结构学、生物化学和进化生物学方面有严重的知识缺陷。同样清楚的是，他们缺乏逻辑思维能力，因而判断力极差。他们不仅未能看到新冠实验室起源的基因的、结构的、进化的清楚证据，而且还可悲地未能认识到新冠是生物武器，哪怕在它已经符合判定标准且已经彻底破坏了世界社会和经济秩序之后。显然，康奈尔和格龙瓦尔与其头衔不相符。他们彻底无能且落后于时代。


> 1. **On troubleshooting molecular cloning. **Line 16: The authors’ statement that there is “almost no risk of [molecular cloning] failing” contradicts experience with the technique, as it can be a finicky method requiring keen problem-solving skills.


【评议者】

关于解决问题的分子克隆。第16行，作者说，分子克隆“几乎没有失败的风险”，与技术经验相悖，因为这是苛刻的方法，需要敏锐的解决问题的技巧。


> Response: This is another laughable comment by Warmbrod et al. Molecular cloning is a routine laboratory technique. It is not exaggerating to say that molecular cloning is only finicky to under-trained hands. Any experienced molecular biologist would be competent to accomplish this cloning swiftly. These “reviewers” from the *Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security*clearly have no hands for molecular biology. Again, they have no qualifications at all as reviewers here.


【闫博士】回应：

这是沃姆布罗德等人又一个可笑的评议。分子克隆是常规实验室技术，说它只对未经训练的人有难度是毫不夸张的。但任何有经验的分子生物学家都能胜任并顺利完成这种克隆。这些约翰霍普金斯健康保障中心的“评议者”显然不懂分子生物学。他们又一次完全不够资格当评议者。


> 2. **Virology protocol inaccuracies. **Lines 25-29: The report inaccurately describes some common laboratory techniques. For example, the report states that sequence information for short segments of coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is possible due to the availability of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol used to identify coronaviruses. However, PCR is not a sequencing method, it only amplifies existent sequences. PCR is a common tool, used to determine if a specific DNA sequence is in a sample and, if so, how many copies of that sequence are in the sample. Using PCR to detect the presence of coronaviruses in a sample is a standard practice in research and clinical laboratories using standard coronavirus-specific primers, as the RdRp is highly conserved between coronaviruses. Approximately 28 current SARS-CoV-2


【评议者】

病毒方案不准确。第25-29行，报告没有准确描述一些普通的实验室技术。例如报告说，因为可以识别冠状病毒的聚合酶链式反应(PCR)，冠状病毒RNA依赖性RNA聚合酶（RdRp）短片段的基因序列数据是可能被获取的。然而，PCR不是测序方法，它只用于放大已存在的序列。PCR只是一个用于确定样本中是否含有某段DNA的普通工具，以及它能确定该样本中含有多少该段DNA的复制。用PCR来侦测样本中冠状病毒的存在是研究中的标准做法，并且是临床实验室所用标准冠状病毒特异性引物，这也是因为RdRp在冠状病毒间是高度保守的。


> Response: This comment is mistaken and shows that Warmbrod et al. lack the most basic knowledge in biological research. We have never said or implicated that PCR alone was a sequencing method. However, it is common knowledge that DNA products after PCR amplification can be conveniently sequenced. More importantly, when detecting coronaviruses from raw fecal samples, PCR amplification is the necessary first step before DNA sequencing. This protocol (RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing) has been used by the Shi lab consistently and has been described numerous times in Shi’s publications. Our description in the report was consistent with this fact:
> 
> “*Dr. Zhengli Shi’s laboratory uses a PCR protocol, which amplifies a particular fragment of the RdRp gene, as their primary method to detect the presence of coronaviruses in raw samples (bat fecal swap, feces, etc). As a result of this practice, the Shi group has documented the sequence information of this short segment of RdRp for all coronaviruses that they have successfully detected and/or collected.*“
> 
> Based on Shi’s published work, any qualified scientist would agree that the Shi lab routinely obtains the sequence information from such PCR products. Clearly, Warmbrod et al. are not such scientists.


【闫博士】回应：

这条评议是错误的并显示出沃姆布罗德等人缺乏大部分生物学研究的基础知识。我们从未说过或暗示过PCR是一个测序方法。然而，经过PCR放大后的DNA可以被便利地测序，这是普通常识。更重要的是，从未经处理的粪便样本中侦测冠状病毒时，PCR放大是DNA测序前必要的第一个步骤。这一方案（RT-PCR，然后是DNA测序）曾被石正丽实验室一直使用，并在石的发表作品中数次被描述过。我们报告里的叙述与如下事实相符：

“石正丽博士的实验室用PCR方案，通过放大了的RdRp基因的特定片段，作为他们在未经处理的样本（蝙蝠粪便等）中侦测冠状病毒的最初方法。这一做法的结果是，石的研究组已经记录下他们成功收集或发现的所有冠状病毒的这一RdRp的短片段的基因序列信息”。

基于石正丽的工作，任何有水平的科学家都会同意，石的实验室例行从这种PCR产物中获得序列信息。显然，沃姆布罗德等人不是这类科学家。

【译者浅释】

在闫博士还原的新冠假想制造流程图中有两条平行的线路，一条是大家都已经知道的，把模板病毒的绑定域用SARS的绑定域替换，以使它能感染人类，并插入弗林酶切位点，令其功能增强。另一条线路是，用RT-PCT技术把RaBtCoV/4991的RdRp和Orf1b的其他片段进行增扩，然后把加工后的这两个部分：刺突蛋白和Orf1b，再和模板病毒的其他剩余部分合并进行整体组装，再经过连续传代，新冠就做好了。其中，Orf1b部分之所以重要，是因为它的RdRp是病毒自我复制的关键组成部分（关系到新病毒是否有足够强的自我增殖能力），所以制作中用RaBtCoV/4991（这个才是石正丽真正发现的病毒，而不是RaTG13，后者是伪造的）的RdRp来担任。这样做还有其他“好处”：1）因为科学界通常以RdRp序列来给冠状病毒分类、分组，把RaBtCoV/4991的RdRp引入新冠，就能使新冠和它的模板病毒ZC45被分在不同的组别，掩盖其人造痕迹；2）这个RdRp十分独特，中共科学家很可能就是用它作为伏笔，把它作为靶点来开发抗病毒药物（解药）。


> 1. **Serial passaging and virulence. **Lines 19-20: Serial passaging refers to a process wherein a stock viral population is used to infect an animal, then a virus from that animal is collected and used to infect another animal for a designated number of “passages.” Serial passage of a virus causes the population to adapt to the animal or cell type in which it is being passaged. Passaging would lead to adaptation to another animal (if passaged in vivo) or, if in vitro, to the specific cell type used. Most human cells used in laboratory culture have significant differences compared to the commensurate cells in humans. Serial passage, then, would not necessarily make a virus more pathogenic to live humans. Additionally, the passage does not necessarily increase the fitness of a viral population. The report mischaracterizes the complexity of these processes and projects outcomes from passaging that are not supported by laboratory techniques.


【评议者】

连续传代和毒性。第19-20行，连续传代指将原始病毒种群感染动物的一种过程，从那种动物体内收集的病毒被用于感染另一种动物，如此往复循环的过程。连续传代使病毒种群适应它经过的那种动物或细胞。该流程将导致病毒适应另一种动物（如果是活体中的流程）或者，如果是在活体里，适应某种特定的细胞。实际上，大部分实验用途的培植人类细胞与等量的真人细胞有显著的差异。所以，连续传代未必能让病毒对活人更有毒性。另外，流程未必能增强病毒种群的适应性。报告错误描述了这些流程的复杂性，并且实验室技术并不支持的这种流程作用下的产物。


> Response: Here, Warmbrod et al. overstated the uncertainty of serial passage. If this comment reflects their honest opinion, then their misjudgment must be due to their complete lack of wet lab experience in the serial passage.
> 
> There are plenty of examples where serial passage has allowed the successful adaptation of a virus to infect a novel host with significant lethality. Using serial passage, Dr. Li-Meng Yan had previously converted influenza A H3N2/Hong Kong/1/68 virus, which is not lethal to mice, to a novel strain that causes efficient infections and high lethality in mice. Dr. Ralph Baric also used the serial passage to successfully convert a strain of the SARS virus into a desired mouse-adapted strain. Warmbrod et al.’s knowledge on serial passage is completely out of line with the reality as evidenced by the literature.
> 
> In addition to driving the viral strain(s) toward optimal fitness and desired lethality, the serial passage also has the benefit of partially mimicking natural evolution and thereby can possibly remove some traces of genetic manipulation.
> 
> The basis for high affinity and high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 may have been determined at an earlier stage, specifically the genetic manipulation of Spike (RBM swap and FCS insertion). The serial passage further optimizes the adaptation of the virus toward human ACE2 receptor in vivo, however, without the need to significantly improve affinity and/or pathogenicity; the molecular basis for both properties should have been established previously.
> 
> Using hACE2 mice for serial passage, as postulated in our report, would be the most convenient, efficient, and inexpensive way of driving the hACE2-oriented adaptation. However, not all pathogenic properties of SARS-CoV-2 associated with human infections could be shown faithfully in this mouse model because of the species differences. Transmissibility is one such property. Dr. Li-Meng Yan has shown that golden hamsters are a great animal model for characterizing the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. If the CCP scientists responsible for the SARS-CoV-2 creation and validation had used golden hamsters to evaluate the viral transmissibility, they might have then come to a more accurate estimation of the transmissibility and would not have described the initial outbreak in Wuhan as “controllable.”


【闫博士】回应：

于此，沃姆布罗德等人夸大了连续传代的不确定性。如果这条评议反映了他们的真实意见，那么他们的错误判断一定是源于他们完全缺乏湿实验室连续传代实验的经验。

在大量的实例中，连续传代曾经使病毒成功适应且以显著的杀伤力感染一个新宿主。闫丽梦博士曾把对鼠类不致命的香港流感A H3N2/Hong Kong/1/68病毒引入了一个新菌株，经过连续传代，合成病毒对鼠类产生有效感染并高度致命。拉尔夫-巴里克博士也曾用连续传代成功地把一个SARS菌株转变为期望的适应鼠类的菌株。沃姆布罗德等人的连续传代知识完全与有文献证据的现实脱节了。

除了驱使病毒株朝最佳适应性和期望的杀伤性发展之外，连续传代也在一定程度上营造出自然进化的假象，因而可以消除基因改造的痕迹。

新冠的高亲和力和高致病性的基础也许已经在之前的阶段被注定了，尤其是刺突（RBM替换和弗林酶切位点插入）的基因变异。连续传代进一步优化了病毒对活体人类细胞受体的适应性，然而，连续传代未必用于提高病毒的亲和力和致病性。这两个属性的分子基础，在连续传代之前已经被确立。用有人类细胞受体的白鼠做连续传代，如我们报告中假设的，是极便利、有效和便宜的手段，用以促进病毒对人类细胞受体的适应。然而，因为物种差异，不是所有新冠的致病或与感染人类相关的属性都是在这种白鼠模式中体现出来的——传递性就是其中之一。闫丽梦博士已经揭示了，对于塑造新冠的传递性来说，金仓鼠是个很大的动物模式。如果负责有效制造新冠的中共科学家当初是用金仓鼠来演进病毒传递性，他们也许就能更准确地估算传递性，就不会说病毒在武汉最初的爆发是“可控的”了。


> 1. Unrealistic timelines. Lines 25-29: The timeline offered for how an entirely novel protein can be engineered in a little-studied virus, circa 2019, is not scientifically realistic.


【评议者】

不切实际的时间线。第25-29行，报告提供的时间线——关于如何在一个没怎么被研究的病毒里（“大约2019”）人为加工一个全新的蛋白——在科学上不现实。


> Response: Contrary to the reviewers’ comment, coronaviruses are well studied. The lack of knowledge by Warmbrod, West, Connell, and Gronvall has been consistently shown in every comment and throughout the review.
> 
> In fact, the Spike proteins of coronaviruses are well studied. So much has been learned on Spike, including atomic details of its interaction with hACE2 revealed by high-resolution structures, that the Spike from ZC45/ZXC21 should not be considered entirely novel. Importantly, genetic engineering of Spike has been done repeatedly in the past, where a Spike of a bat coronavirus would be successfully converted into a novel Spike capable of binding hACE2 and thereby establishing infection in human cells. Dr. Fang Li used less than two months to accomplish the following: RBM-swapping, Spike (RBD) engineering, and solving the crystal structure of the novel RBD in complex with hACE2 (their manuscript was submitted to *Nature*on Feb 16th, 2020). In our report, we estimated the time for completing the RBM swap as 1.5 months. Note that our postulated step here does not involve protein crystallization, diffraction data collection, structure solution, model building, refinement, or manuscript preparation, which Dr. Fang Li and colleagues did go through for their *Nature*publication. The timeline we offered is scientifically sound and reasonable. Warmbrod et al.’s comment here, however, is clearly mistaken.


【闫博士】回应：

与评议者的评议相反，冠状病毒是被很好地研究了的。沃姆布罗德、韦斯特、康奈尔和格龙瓦尔始终一致地在每条评议中显露其缺乏知识。

事实上，冠状病毒的刺突蛋白是被深入研究了的。研究者关于刺突已经知道了很多，包括其与人类细胞受体相互作用的原子细节都已经被高分辨率的结构学揭露出来。因此，ZC45/ZXC21的刺突不可以被看作是全新的。重要的是，刺突的基因工程已经在过去被反复做过，比如，一个蝙蝠冠状病毒的刺突蛋白能成功被转为一个新的能绑定人类细胞受体的刺突，因而能感染人类细胞。李放博士用不到两个月的时间完成了如下工作：RBM替换、刺突绑定域基因工程、解决新绑定域晶体结构和人类细胞受体的复合（他们的作品于2020年2月16日发表在《自然》杂志上）。我们在报告里估算了，完成新冠的RBM替换要1.5个月。注意，我们此处假定的步骤不包括蛋白结晶化、衍射数据收集、结构解析、模型建立——李放博士和同事们在《自然》上发表作品时的确做了这些步骤。我们提供的时间线是科学上充分的和有理由的。沃姆布罗德等人的这一评议怎么说都是错误的。


> **Methods of genetic modification in viruses. **Lines 11-12: The authors incorrectly state those reverse genetics systems are commonly used to assemble coronaviruses. Reverse genetics can be used in other virus syntheses, such as influenza. The paper the authors cite, from Thao and colleagues, did use reverse genetics in a yeast-based system to synthesize full-length SARS- CoV-2. However, previous research had identified that coronaviruses can be particularly difficult to engineer using reverse genetics systems, as the large size of Nidovirus genomes, replicase activity, and requirement for large transcript synthesis create obstacles. Certain methods require the insertion of mutations elsewhere in the genome to manage the T7 transcription termination signals or require helper viruses to coinfect cells to aid in cloning. Recent work in dengue viruses and MERS has shown the promise of Gibson assembly in synthesizing positive-strand viruses.


【评议者】

病毒基因改造的方法。第11-12行，作者不正确地说，反向基因系统通常被用于组装冠状病毒。反向基因可以被用于其他病毒的合成，例如流感。作者引用的论文，邵与其同事确实在一个基于酵母的系统里用反向基因合成了全长度的新冠。可是以前的研究已经确认，冠状病毒用反向基因系统可能加工起来特别困难，比如巢病毒基因组这样大的规模，酶的复制和获取、大的合成副本都会产生障碍。这些方法需要在基因组的其他地方插入变异，用于给T7转录终止信号，或需要辅助病毒共同感染细胞，给克隆提供辅助。最近的有关登革病毒和MERS的工作显示，合成正链病毒的吉布森组装是可靠的。


> Response: This is yet another ignorant comment made by these “reviewers.” Reverse genetics has been used repeatedly to assemble the coronavirus genomes. Our statement was accurate and supported by the vast literature. Warmbrod et al. have no qualifications whatsoever in serving as reviewers here.


【译】（闫博士的回击）

回应：这是这些“评议者”又一条无知的评议。反向基因系统已经被反复用于组装冠状病毒基因组。我们的说法是准确的并被大量文献所支持。沃姆布罗德等人于此没资格当评议者。


> 2. **Reverse genetics tools (and limitations). **Lines 22-24: Reverse genetics and synthetic biology provide technological tools to synthesize SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by the methods section of the Thao paper. The yeast used for this synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 used a specific platform that depended on a mouse hepatitis virus. The description in Yan et al of pooling the DNA fragments together and “transforming” them into yeast will not work, as it would require a method known as transformation-associated recombination, calling into question the Yan analysis.


【评议者】

反向基因工具（及其局限性）。第22-24行，反向基因和合成生物学提供了技术工具来合成新冠，如邵的论文所示的方法。用于此新冠合成的酵母用了一个小鼠肝炎病毒的特定平台。闫等人描述的把DNA片段联接起来转化为酵母是行不通的，因为它会需要像转换联系重组这样的方法，所以对闫的分析表示怀疑。


> Response: If this is an honest comment, then Warmbrod et al. had no idea what they were talking about. They argued that “*pooling the DNA fragments together and ‘transforming’ them into yeast will not work, as it would require a method known as transformation-associated recombination*.” This judgment is proven wrong. The reference we cited here did just that to construct the SARS-CoV-2 genome: they pooled the DNA fragments together and transformed them into yeast.

> To readers who were misled by Warmbrod et al., this yeast-based reverse genetic system relies on the homologous recombination machinery in yeast cells to synthesize the full genome of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, as long as viral genomic DNA fragments with the overlapping sequence that shares homology on both ends and the YAC vector fragments are co-transfected, the homologous recombination machinery in yeast will assemble the whole viral genome. Vectors containing the desired whole viral genome can then be selected, amplified, and isolated. Contrary to what has been suggested by Warmbrod et al., this method is independent of any viral platform because it is a cloning method to synthesize DNA by using the *in vivo*recombination machinery of budding yeast. As mentioned in the reference in our report, this method had been used, before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to successfully synthesize a DNA virus with a large viral genome. The same method had also been used in 2020 to synthesize the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

【闫博士】回应：

如果这是一条诚实的评议，那么沃姆布罗德等人对他们正在说的东西一无所知。他们争辩说，“把DNA片段联接起来转化为酵母是行不通的，因为它会需要像转换联系重组这样的方法。”这个判断被证明是错误的。我们引用的资料就是这么干的，并且他们建成了新冠基因组：他们把DNA片段联接起来把它们转为酵母。这个精确的过程被称作“酵母的转换联系重组”。沃姆布罗德等人能让自己这么下不来台真是惊人。

（我想）对被沃姆布罗德等人误导的读者（说），这基于酵母的反向基因系统是依靠酵母细胞里的同源重组机制来合成新冠的全长度基因组的。所以，只要病毒的携带重叠序列的基因片段在两端都同源，且YAC载体片段是共转染的，酵母中的同源重组机制就会组装整个病毒基因。带着期望的整个病毒基因的载体就会被选中、放大和提取。与沃姆布罗德等人所说的相反，这个方法不依赖任何病毒平台，因为它是用出芽酵母的活体重组机制合成DNA的克隆方法。如我们报告的参考资料所述，这个方法在新冠大流行之前就已经被使用了，（研究者）成功合成了一个基因组很大的DNA病毒。同样的方法也在2020年被用来合成新冠基因组。

另外，除了基于酵母的方法，我们在报告里也说了，其他反向基因技术也很完善，可被善用。文献清楚显示，有许多反向基因技术已经被冠状病毒专家成功地运用过了。

沃姆布罗德等人又一次想在自己一窍不通的事情上搅混水。考虑到这个主题有关公共健康和国家安全，他们的行为可以用不负责任，甚至卑鄙来形容。


> 3. **On viral passaging and adaptation. **Lines 34-35: Adaptation for receptors likely improves the infectability of a virus, but it does not necessarily make the virus more transmissible, pathogenic, or virulent. Even if the virus adapts to the receptor, it does not mean that the virus will be able to cause viremia or transmit to other hosts. The report falsely asserts that serial passage would “validate the virus’ fitness and ensure its receptor-oriented adaptation toward its intended host” and also argue a contradictory theory on page 3 that the virus *was not*serially passaged. While viral passaging can optimize viral fitness, this is never a guarantee and has to be scientifically demonstrated.


【评议者】

关于病毒传递和适应。第34-35行，适应受体可能增强病毒的感染力，但是这未必使病毒更具传递性、致病性或毒性。即使病毒适应了受体，不意味着病毒能引起对其他宿主的病毒血症或传递性。报告错误地断言，连续传代能“使病毒具备有效的”适应性，进而确保它对设定的宿主的受体的导向性，却又在第三页立起一个相反的理论，即病毒没有经过连续传代。病毒传代能令其适应性最佳化，这不是万无一失的，而是需要科学的证明。


> Response: Warmbrod et al. once again distorted our report and at the same time were mistaken in every single point they raised here.
> 
> First, we never described receptor-oriented adaptation in the serial passage as the sole step to decide transmissibility, pathogenicity, or virulence. As we have described in one of our earlier responses, the molecular bases of high affinity, pathogenicity, and virulence should have been largely set by the genetic engineering of Spike. However, serial passage would be set up in a way that strains with improved affinity and virulence could be selected and developed further. This process, which enhances affinity, could have, to some extent, also enhanced transmissibility. Also, importantly, the serial passage is necessary as it ensures that the virus is optimized as a whole (individual components of it have been derived separately) for *in vivo*replication and fitness. It also ensures that the genome is stabilized. For an artificial viral pathogen aimed at destruction, it is important that its genome is stable and the virus does not attenuate quickly in the intended host. Therefore, our statement that serial passage would validate the virus’ fitness and ensure its receptor-oriented adaptation to its intended host is justified and accurate.
> 
> Second, Warmbrod et al. distorted our description on page 3 and thereby created room to insert their otherwise unjustified criticism. Our original description was that the furin-cleavage site “*must have been inserted into the SARS-CoV-2 genome artificially by techniques other than simple serial passage ……*” Clearly, we meant that the artificial insertion of FCS could not be done using the serial passage. We have never said that the virus was not serially passaged. The intentional distortion of our report by Warmbrod et al. had shown repeatedly in their comments, which spells out the sinister nature of their motives in “volunteering” as “reviewers” here.
> 
> Finally, Warmbrod et al. argued that the classical method serial passage would not be able to guarantee optimization of viral fitness. This is a pretentious comment, which shows Warmbrod et al.’s superficial understanding of the serial passage. We would bet that Warmbrod et al. will not be able to optimize viral fitness using the serial passage in a lab. However, it would be so only because they are clearly incompetent scientists and have no wet-lab experience in the serial passage. We remain fully confident in stating that serial passage can be used to improve and optimize viral fitness.


【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人又来歪曲我们的报告，同时，他们在所说的每个点上都犯了错。

首先，我们从未说过，连续传代中的获得受体导向性的适合性是决定传递性、致病性或毒性的唯一步骤。如我们之前的一条回应中所说，高亲和力、致病性和毒性的分子基础绝大部分是由刺突蛋白的基因工程确立的。然而，连续传代会某种程度上令毒株亲和力增进，并令毒性具选择性，从而得到进一步的发展。这个提高亲和力的过程某种程度上也会提高传递性。以及，重要的是，连续传代是必要的，因为它确保病毒作为整体（各个部分的能力已经分别单独获得）对于活体的复制和适应得到最优化。它还确保基因组是稳定的。对于一个致力于毁灭的人造病毒，病毒的稳定以及在它蓄意瞄准的宿主体内不会快速减弱是重要的特性。所以，我们说连续传代能令病毒对它蓄意瞄准的宿主的适应性有效，并确保它针对的受体趋向性的适应性，是准确的和正当的。

第二，沃姆布罗德等人歪曲我们报告的第三页，来给他们塞入不公正的批评制造空间。我们原本的叙述是，弗林酶切位点“一定是被用连续传代以外的技术人工插入到新冠基因里的……”显然，我们的意思是，弗林酶切位点的人工插入不可能用连续传代来完成。我们从未说过病毒未经连续传代。沃姆布罗德等人这种对我们报告的故意歪曲已经在其评议中反复地出现，这凸显其阴险的本质和“志愿”充当“评议者”的动机。

最后，沃姆布罗德等人辩称，连续传代的典型方法不能够保证病毒适应性的最优化。这是狂妄的评议，显示出沃姆布罗德等人对连续传代的肤浅理解。我们敢打赌，沃姆布罗德等人没本事在实验室用连续传代来最优化一个病毒的适应性。然而，这只是因为他们显然是无能的科学家，并且没有湿实验室做连续传代实验的经验。我们仍充满自信地说，连续传代可以被用来提高和最优化病毒的适应性。


> 4. **SARS-CoV-2 animal models. **Line 39: Finding an animal model for SARS-CoV-2 has been difficult and, before 2020, there was not a good animal model for SARS-CoV, so the idea of “serial passage in laboratory animals” would have been challenging.


【评议者】

新冠的动物模型。第39行，找出新冠的一种动物模型是困难的，且2020年之前，对新冠没有好的动物模型，所以，提出“连续传代的实验室动物”是有争议的。


> Response: This is yet another shockingly ignorant comment by Warmbrod et al. Many animal models have been used for studying SARS. Many models have also been used to study SARS-CoV-2 right after the pandemic started4, which is clearly at odds with their comment that “*(f)inding an animal model for SARS-CoV-2 has been difficult*.”

> Their comment that serial passage in laboratory animals would have been challenging is also mistaken. The opposite is true as evidence by the literature.
> 
> It is noteworthy though that, although animal models are readily available, no single animal model would be perfect and show all pathogenic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. It is, after all, a model.
> 
> The comment once again shows the complete lack of qualification of Warmbrod et al. as reviewers.


【闫博士】回应：

这是另一次沃姆布罗德等人的惊人无知的评议。许多动物模型被用于研究SARS，就在大流行爆发之后，许多动物模型也被用于研究新冠，这显然与他们“发现新冠的一种动物模型是困难的”这一评议相悖。

他们说实验室动物的连续传代是有争议的评议是错误的。相反的，这些是被文献所证明了的。

值得注意的是，尽管动物模型真的是有，但是没有任何一个单一动物模型是完美的且能显示新冠感染人类的所有特征。所以，说到底，它只是个模型。

这条评议又一次显出沃姆布罗德等人作为评议者的完全不合格。


> 1. **Serial passaging and virulence. **Lines 2-4: The authors incorrectly assert that serial passage of a virus only leads to increased virulence. The report asserts that 10 to 15 rounds of passage would improve the viral Spike protein’s binding affinity and the infectivity and lethality of the virus. However, serial passaging does not always lead to genome stabilization, as some viral populations may die off. Of the strains that do stabilize, infection efficiency is only enhanced for the model species used for passaging, not for all species. Some of these (millions of) virions may be more lethal or infectious, just as many may be less so. Passaging cannot guarantee an outcome of viral evolution. The life cycle of a virus and infection efficiency depends on more than just receptor binding, and adaptation to 1 organ or 1 type of receptor may come at the expense of reduced ability to spread to other organs, cause viremia, shed from 1 host, or cause pathogenicity.


【评议者】

连续传代和毒性。第2-4行，作者不正确地宣称，病毒的连续传代只导致增进毒性。报告说，10到15轮传代会增进刺突蛋白的绑定亲和力和病毒的感染力及致命性。然而，连续传代不总是导致基因稳定性，因为一些病毒会相继死亡。至于确实稳定的毒株，感染效果只对被用来传代的模型物种所提高，而非所有物种。一些（数以百万计）病毒也许不会变得更致命或更有感染性，许多会更弱。传代不能保证病毒演进会出现的预期结果。病毒的生存周期和感染力依靠许多因素，远多于仅仅是受体绑定，而适应一个器官或一种受体可能伴随着降低传播给其他器官的能力的代价，比如，导致病毒血症，或者从宿主脱落后具有致病性。


> Response: Warmbrod et al. showed, once again, their lack of understanding of the serial passage. The serial passage is not an experiment that runs on a natural course. There is a targeted experimental design (e.g. the use of hACE2-mice), which sets a direction for viral adaptation. There is also selection, which filters out the unwanted strains and enriches the ones with the desired property. Depending on the goal of the experiment, one can select more lethal strains or less lethal ones. Unlike what Warmbrod et al. described here, we have never said that serial passage of a virus only leads to increased virulence. However, we do assert that, if increased virulence is the goal, it can be successfully achieved by a proper serial passage experiment. The comment by Warmbrod et al. here is, once again, false and misleading.
> 
> Also, we have never stated that receptor binding dictates transmissibility or pathogenicity. We have commented on receptor-binding, transmissibility, and pathogenicity in previous responses and will not repeat it here again.
> 
> However, we do want to reiterate that, although receptor-binding is an important goal of the adaptation, the serial passage does not only optimize the virus on receptor-binding. It is also a necessary step to optimize the overall fitness, replication efficiency, and pathogenicity of the virus *in vivo*.


【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人再一次显示出对于连续传代的缺乏理解。连续传代不是一种在自然条件下进行的实验。这是有目的的实验设计（例如人类细胞受体小白鼠的使用），它设立了一个病毒适应的方向。其中也有选择性，即过滤掉不想要的毒株并增多有需要属性的毒株。这取决于实验的目的，人们可以选择更致命的毒株或致命性低一些的毒株。不像沃姆布罗德等人所说的，我们从未说过一个病毒的连续传代只会导致毒性增强。然而，我们确实宣称，如果增强毒性是目的，它一定能通过一定的连续传代实验来成功获得。沃姆布罗德等人的这一评议又是错误的和具有误导性的。另外，我们从未说过受体绑定规定了传递性和致病性。我们已经在之前的回应中评议了受体绑定性、传递性和致病性，在此就不再重复了。

然而我们确实想要再次重申，尽管受体绑定性是适应性的一个重要目标，连续传代并不只是要最优化病毒的受体绑定性。它对于整体性的最优化、复制的有效性和在活体内的致命性也是必要的步骤。


> **On laboratory adaptation leading to increased virulence. **Lines 16-21: Viral adaptation can include attenuation. That is one reason why viruses and bacteria are sometimes serially passaged for attenuation to be used in vaccines. It cannot be stated as Yan and colleagues do that there is a “lack of apparent attenuation” so far in this pandemic because the global incidence of COVID-19 (especially asymptomatic cases) is unknown, or that viral adaptation, in vitro or in vivo, led to increasing transmissibility or virulence.


【评议者】

关于实验室适应性导致毒性增强。第16-21行，病毒适应性包括衰减。这是为什么病毒和细菌有时经连续传代来衰减以用在疫苗中的原因。不可能像闫和她的同事们说的那样，目前在大流行中“没有明显衰减”，毕竟新冠肺炎的全球影响（尤其是无症状病例）还不清楚，或者说活体内或活体外的病毒适应性导致增强传递性或毒性（还不清楚）。


> Response: Contrary to Warmbrod et al.’s criticism, our description that there is a “*lack of apparent attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 so far despite its great prevalence*” has been proven to be the reality. The pandemic has been going on for over a year and yet there is no apparent attenuation of the virus. In fact, a very recent finding strengthened our point even further: the later emerged, the dominant strain showed enhanced infectivity, fitness, and transmission. It is again clear which side has the truth and which side has been consistently mistaken.


【闫博士】回应：

与沃姆布罗德等人的批评相反，即我们的“尽管如此广泛，目前在大流行中没有明显衰减”的说法已经被证明是事实了。大流行已经持续了一年多，病毒确实还没有明显衰减。事实上，最近的发现甚至更加强了我们的论点：越是后出现的、主流的毒株越显示增强的感染力、适应性和传递性。是哪一方拥有真相，而哪一方始终如一地犯错，再次一目了然。


> **Viral mutation rates. **Line 24: The authors state that if the serial passage is confined to 1 species, less random mutations occur, but this is incorrect. Mutation rates are a function of the RdRp, as well as the ExoN proofreading enzyme, and so repeated passage will not inherently make a virus more or less likely to mutate. However, the passage does affect which mutations become fixed in the viral population. Coronaviruses form a quasispecies, where each variant within the population can be different from the others and have different fitnesses. Together, the population of variants infects a host, disseminates from the initial infection site, and causes pathogenesis. During a passage, the viral variants best suited for infection and pathogenesis within the model organism are selected, but the rate of mutations occurring does not change. Because mutations can still occur, there is a possibility the virus can adapt, unless the mutations cause so many deleterious mutations that the population collapses.


【评议者】

病毒变异比例。第24行，作者说，如果连续传代限于一个物种，较少会出现随机变异的现象，但这是不对的。变异比例是RdRp以及外显子校正酶的功能， 这样反复的传代不会固定地令病毒或更多或更少地变异。然而，传代确实影响了那些在病毒里固定下来的变异。冠状病毒们来自许多准种，每一种都不同且有不同的适应性。它们一起感染一个宿主，从最初的感染点散播，并产生病原体。在传代中，模型器官里最佳适应感染和病原体的变异被遴选出来，但出现变异的比例不变。因为变异可能继续出现，有可能病毒会适应，直到变异造成太多有害变异而使该种崩溃。


> Response: We have never stated or implicated in our report that, “if the *serial passage is confined to 1 species, less random mutations occur*.” We never linked the number of species in serial passage to the rate of mutation. This is, again, another shameful distortion of our report by Warmbrod et al. The rest of the comment seems to be a pointless muttering rather than an articulation of anything.


【闫博士】回应：

我们在报告中从未说过或暗示过，“如果连续传代限于一个物种，较少会出现随机变异”。我们从未把连续传代的物种数量和变异的比例联系在一起。这又是沃姆布罗德等人对我们报告的可耻的歪曲。评议的其余部分似乎只是无意义的喃喃自语，等于什么都没说。


> ** (Conclusion)**
> 
> While the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on global public health is undeniable, the pathogenic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection at an individual or cellular level are not unprecedented. Many viruses are capable of causing high morbidity and mortality, infecting several organs, and/ or presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission.61 Additionally, other viral infections (eg, chikungunya) also induce long-term sequelae. Humans have contended with many scourges and it is a certainty that COVID-19 will not be the last.


【评议者】

总结：当新冠对全球公共健康的冲击无可质疑时，新冠感染个体或细胞的致病性效果水平并非史无前例。许多病毒能够引起高发病率和高死亡率，感染数个器官，并且/或者有症状或无症状传染。另外，其他病毒性感染（例如基孔肯雅病）也会引起长期后遗症。人类已经战胜过许多灾难，并且可以肯定，新冠不会是最后一个。


> Response: Warmbrod et al. again distorted the meaning of our report, although this time they did it more subtly. Our exact words here were:
> 
> “*The characteristics and pathogenic effects of SARS-CoV-2 are unprecedented. The virus is highly transmissible, onset-hidden, multi-organ targeting, sequelae-unclear, lethal, and associated with various symptoms and complications.*“
> 
> Clearly, the word “*unprecedented*” here was used to describe the collective characteristics and pathogenic effects caused by SARS-CoV-2. Warmbrod et al., however, listed different viruses, each showing one or two of these effects, and used them as counter-evidence of our argument. The fact that they could not come up with a proper example to support their own argument indeed proves our statement that the characteristics and pathogenic effects of SARS-CoV-2 are unprecedented.
> 
> Furthermore, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 is not limited to just pathogenicity and global health. The scale of destruction in social orders and the economy caused by COVID-19 is also unprecedented. For a novel pathogen with such an impact, the question of its origin should not be answered lightly.
> 
> However, unfortunately, since the beginning of the pandemic, the theory of SARS-CoV-2 having a natural origin has been promoted widely even though the evidence for it is very weak and often omitted in such promotions. Gigi Gronvall, one of the four “peer reviewers” here, is among the scientists who were engaged in pushing the natural origin theory since the beginning of the pandemic. A great deal of their efforts here was directed at suppressing the lab origin theories and degrading them into “conspiracy theories” to mislead the public. This review published by Gronvall and colleagues here serves the same purpose.
> 
> However, as revealed by these comments, Gronvall and the three other “reviewers” have a severe deficiency of knowledge in every branch of biology that is relevant to our report: virology, molecular biology, structural biology, biochemistry, and evolutionary biology. It is shameful and utterly irresponsible for Gronvall et al. to produce a review on our report when they are completely unqualified to do so. They also intentionally distorted our reports on multiple occasions and then inserted their otherwise-unjustified criticisms. Importantly and aggravatingly, what is being muddled by their despicable behaviors is the most urgent question that the world is facing – what is the true origin of the COVID-19 pandemic.
> 
> Through these comments, Gronvall and her three colleagues have thoroughly proved that they are shoddy scientists who should not be trusted in the discussion of the origin of SARS-CoV-2. It has also become evident that there is no evidence to prove a natural origin for SARS-CoV-2.


【闫博士】回应：

沃姆布罗德等人再次歪曲我们的报告，尽管这次做得更加巧妙。我们实际上说的是：

“新冠的属性和致病效果是史无前例的。病毒高度可传播、起病隐蔽、以多器官为目标、后遗症不明、致命且症状多样兼多并发症。”

很清楚，“史无前例的”这个词是用来描述新冠的许多属性和致病效果的。沃姆布罗德等人好歹罗列了不同的病毒，每种病毒显示了一两个效果，就把它们当作我们论点的反证。事实是，他们无法举出一个合适的样例来支持他们的论点，这实实在在证明了，我们所说的新冠的属性和致病效果是史无前例的。

更进一步的是，新冠的冲击不仅只限于致病性和全球健康。新冠肺炎造成的社会秩序和经济破坏的范围也是史无前例的。对一个造成如此冲击的新病毒，它的起源问题不应被如此轻易地作答。

然而，不幸的是，从大流行开始之后，尽管证据微弱，新冠自然起源理论却被广泛抛出，有时甚至不讲证据。吉吉-格龙瓦尔，四位评议者之一，是自大流行开始后参与并推动自然起源理论的科学家之一。他们的大量努力被用于压制实验室起源理论，并把它们贬为“阴谋论”来误导公众。这份由格龙瓦尔和其同事发表的评议为的是同一个目的。

然而，如这些评议所示，格龙瓦尔和其他三位评议者在与我们的报告相关的生物学的每个分支上都有严重知识缺陷：病毒学、分子生物学、生物结构学、生物化学和生物进化学。格龙瓦尔等人在完全不够格的情况下，对我们的报告炮制这样的评议，是可耻的和完全不负责任的。他们还在许多地方故意歪曲我们的报告，否则就无法塞入他们的不公正的批评。更重要且令人愤怒的是，被他们的卑鄙行为搅浑的，是全世界面对的最紧迫的问题——新冠的起源真相。

通过这些评议，格龙瓦尔和她的三位合作者证明了，他们是低劣的科学家，在讨论新冠起源问题上绝不可信。同样明显的是，新冠自然起源说毫无证据。


> **The other thing that Gronvall et al. succeeded in achieving here is to prove to the world that the Yan reports are unshakable scientifically**.
> 
> As we have concluded in our second report, the evidence collectively indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is an *Unrestricted Bioweapon*developed by the CCP government and that its release to the human population was a planned execution. The world has to face this truth and treat SARS-CoV-2 for what it really is. Compromising on this issue entails prolonged suffering of the human race and continued social and economic loss. It would also signify the success of the CCP’s “perfect crime,” which may encourage the CCP and possibly other regimes to launch future attacks using other *Unrestricted Bioweapons*.
> 
> Our two reports, which so far could not be challenged by anybody scientifically, hold the truth to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our upcoming report will be produced to this same standard. These reports need to be treated seriously if the world wants to look in the right direction to find the true origin of this pandemic.


【闫博士】

格龙瓦尔等人成功做到的另一件事就是，向全世界证明，闫博士的报告在科学上无可动摇。

如我们在第二篇报告中总结的，把证据综合起来即显示出，新冠是中共政府开发并散布到人群中的超限生物武器，这是有计划的行动。世界必须面对现实，把新冠以其本来面目来应对。在此事上妥协，将引起人类苦难的拖延和社会及经济损失的继续。它也将意味着，中共“完美犯罪”的成功——那将鼓励他们，以及其他可能的政权，将来更进一步用其他超限生物武器发起攻击。

迄今为止，我们未能被任何人科学地挑战的两篇报告，含有新冠大流行的真相。我们将来的报告也将以同一标准写就。如果世界真的想要找到追溯大流行的真实起源的正确方向，这些报告必须要被严肃地对待。
