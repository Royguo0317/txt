## 文贵给国内战友的两条建议，希望大家务必珍惜、务必小心
` Himalaya Rose Garden Team` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/742274/)

新闻简述：在2021年1月9日的盖特视频中，郭先生给国内的战友们提出了两点忠告。一、中国的经济崩溃在即，苦日子还远没有来到，必须做好充分的准备。二、病毒的灾难还没有开始，绝不可忽视。最终只有中国人依靠爆料革命，以共灭共、以中国人灭共，中国人才可能有好日子过，此外中国人别无选择。最后他说：“世界上最后强大的一定是美国”、“灭共事业上，我们会有奇招，会有奇迹给大家，走着看！”

There are two things that I haven’t told you guys yet. In the past two days, we have seen the great power of our fellow fighters, especially those in mainland China. Our fellow fighters in mainland China are truly under all kinds of threats. Compared with them, our fellow fighters overseas should take a knee and thank God everyday. Especially our fellow fighters in Hebei, Dalian, and Shenyang, I see that many families and loved ones of theirs have contracted with the CCP virus.

我还有两件事没给大家说。就是这两天啊，咱们真是看到了我们战友伟大的力量，特别是国内的战友。国内的战友现在是处在真的是各种威胁之中。我们海外的战友要跟国内的战友比，我们就天天磕头，感谢上天吧。特别是河北、大连、沈阳的战友，现在看到很多家人、亲人，都染上了共产党的 CCP 病毒。

Let me tell you this again. All of our fellow fighters in mainland China, if you can connect with each other and have the ability to help others, please do help each other. Seriously, the worse days haven’t come yet, the disaster of the virus hasn’t really begun yet. There is something that I really dare not to tell you directly. After all, this is in a public platform, on social media, but you will understand. I have proved to you in the past year. Fellow fighters in China, including all who trust me, my friends, relatives, and families, please trust what I said: year 2021 is much much worse than year 2020. This is one thing.

我再次给大家说，所有国内的战友们，互相之间你们能联系的，能互相帮助的一定要帮助。真的苦日子还没来呢，这个病毒的灾难还没开始呢。我有些话真是不敢直接说，毕竟在公众场合、媒体，你们会明白的。过去一年证明给你们看了，国内战友们，包括所有相信文贵的，朋友、亲人、家人，要相信我说的话，2021年比2020年要糟糕的多的多的多，这是一个。

Another thing is that, my brothers and sisters in arms, I want to tell you about the domestic economy and real estate. Brothers and sisters, the CCP’s “land sale” economy, i.e., real estate economy, and the CCP’s trading economy which totally relies on the 100 billion dollars per year’s trade with the US are over, absolutely over.

另外一个兄弟姐妹们，我要给大家说的，关于国内的经济情况和房地产。兄弟姐妹们，共产党的卖地经济、房地产经济，还有一个这种共产党的完全就是依靠一年1000多亿在美国搞的那个贸易经济，还有国内的卖地经济，绝对结束了，绝对结束了。

So, food and the survival in China and the living environment are the things that you should consider the most. You don’t need to trust Miles, but with your suitable ability, you should make a proper arrangement. Many fellow fighters sent me messages asking me questions. I can’t reply each and everyone of them, and I shouldn’t reply everyone because everyone’s environment is different. Nevertheless, there is one thing that is in common: the China kidnapped by the CCP is stepping into the worst disaster. If we could take down the CCP this year, the Chinese people may still have some good days to live, but if we can’t take down the CCP, then the Chinese people will live a life even worse than a dog or a pig’s. This is not to scare you guys, absolutely not.

所以说在国内今年粮食和生存，还有一个生存的环境是你最重要考虑的。你不一定要相信文贵，你在你合适的能力下，你要做一个妥善的安排。很多战友给我发来信息问我，我没法一一给你回，也不应该一一给你回，因为每个人的整个的你所处的环境不同，但有一样是同的：共产党这个所谓绑架的中国，将走向灾难的灾难。今年如果灭了共，中国人还能有好日子过，如果不灭了共，那中国人民真的是过着猪狗不如的日子。这不是吓唬大家。绝对。

Brothers and sisters, I hope what I said was all wrong because that would mean a better situation for our fellow fighters and compatriots. But everyone should remember [what I said]. After all, we hope to prevent those from happening. The Witshleblower Movement and the New Federal State of China are to make Chinese people to live a life which is safe, decent, with rule of law, belief, freedom, and independence, and most of all, we believe “only truth is unbreakable”. I believe what I said is true, so I hope you all to consider. China’s domestic economy, real estate, and trade are a mess, which you have felt yourselves.

希望兄弟姐妹们，我希望这种事情说的都是错的，因为错的对战友们对同胞们更好。但是大家要记住，我们毕竟要防范嘛。爆料革命、新中国联邦，就是让中国人过上安全的、体面的、法治、信仰、自由独立的生活，更重要是唯真不破。所以我说我认为是真的话，但是供大家参考。国内的经济、地产、贸易，一塌糊涂，你自己有感受。

Second, don’t underestimate the virus. It’s a huge deal. These two things [economy and virus] together are the greatest threats above everything else. Please remember this forever: taking down the CCP is our ultimate goal. We ask people to only take down the CCP within the limits of their ability and given that you can survive first. If you can’t even survive, how can you take down the CCP, brothers and sisters?

二、病毒决不可小觑，这是天大的事。所有这两样加在一起，比所有的一切威胁都大。永远要记住，灭共是我们的终极目标，让大家在力所能及可承受的范围内，再灭共，你活下去再灭共，你都活不下去，你咋灭共啊兄弟姐妹们？

Eventually, the strongest power in this world will be America, definitely America. To the fellow fighters who have arrived at the West, please hold on, hold on, and hold on! Please cherish the secured environment, the freedom, and the rule of law now. Compared with our compatriots in mainland China, we should feel thankful every minute and every second.

这个世界上最后强大的一定是美国，一定是美国。特别到了西方文明国家的战友们，撑住，撑住，撑住！珍惜现在安全、自由的、法制的环境。跟国内同胞比，我们每一分钟、每一秒钟都要充满着感恩和感激。

Another thing that we should always remember: Chinese people’s problems should be ultimately solved by the Chinese people. That is taking down the CCP by the CCP, taking down the CCP by the Chinese, and taking down the CCP by the Whistleblower Movement. That is the central theme that we should never forget. Brothers and sisters, everything has already begun, and no one can stop this. Do we have other choices? The only choice we have is to take down the CCP. Only for people who don’t take it for real, they may have other choices for the time being, but ultimately they will have no choices. Simple as it is.

还有一个，要永远记住，中国人的事，最终要中国人解决，就是以共灭共，中国人灭共，爆料革命灭共，这是核心的主题，永远不要忘了。兄弟姐妹们一切都已经开始，没有任何人可以停下。有更多选择吗？我们只有灭共。只有假灭共的人，你现在可以做任何选择，但是最后你也没选择。就这么简单。

6:54-end

Regarding taking down the CCP, we will have secret weapons, and will have miracles to show to everyone, wait and see!

灭共事业上，我们会有奇招，会有奇迹给大家，走着看！
