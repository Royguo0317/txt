1214晚间要闻-NewYork Time

**LuDe Media 20201214 Evening News, New York Time**

**美国成立专门委员会，负责制裁中共**

**U.S. Established Special Committee to Sanction CCP**

美国在国家安全委员会之上，成立了更高级别的国家紧急状态委员会，里面有两位华人（郭先生和谁？）和两位爆料革命的美国战友（朱利安尼、班农？）。在这个国家紧急状态委员会里面，有一个专门委员会，负责制定对中共的制裁方案。

Above the National Security Council, National Emergency Committee, a higher-level, has been established, which includes two Chinese (Mr. Guo and who?) and two American battle-companions of the Whistleblower Movement (Giuliani and Bannon?). Within this Committee, a special committee is set up to develop the sanctions program against the CCP.

**北约评估中共网络攻击，防火墙真的要倒了**

**NATO Assessed CCP Cyber Attacks, and CCP Firewall Going Down**

Zerohedge发推，北约正在评估中共刚刚发动的网络攻击的风险，意味着调查工作已经基本完成了。评估结果很快出炉，不管表面上是谁在攻击，最终必然证实是中共干的，因为找出真相的调查权、裁判权都在美国和北约手里。之前川普总统在打击中共上优柔寡断，是因为沼泽地背后的力量在犹豫，只要这股力量下决心灭共了，什么招都可以用。一旦正式认定中共发动了网络攻击，美国和北约自动还击，破掉防火墙指日可待。

Zerohedge tweeted that NATO was assessing the risks of the cyber-attacks just launched by the CCP, which means that the investigation has been almost completed. The assessment will come out soon, and no matter who launched the attacks appearingly, it will inevitably be confirmed that the CCP committed it in the end, for the power to investigate and adjudicate to find out the truth is in the hands of the United States and NATO. President Trump was indecisive in cracking down on the CCP previously because the forces behind the swamp was hesitant, and now as long as the forces resolved to exterminate the CCP, any trick could be applied. Once it is formally recognized that the CCP launched the cyber-attacks, the U.S. and NATO will automatically fight back and the CCP firewall will be pushed down soon.

**蓬佩奥：中共是世界安全的最大威胁**

**Pompeo: CCP is the Biggest Threat to World Security**

蓬佩奥接受采访时说：中共是美国人民安全的最大威胁，也是世界人民安全最大的威胁；中共用所谓的军民融合打造霸权主义，通过商业行为偷取美国上百万的就业机会，对美国人民造成了实实在在的威胁；用香港国安法夺走了香港人民的全部自由，破坏了对香港50年自由的承诺。

Pompeo said in an interview: the CCP is the greatest threat to the security of the Americans and people of the world; the CCP has used the so-called civil-military fusion to construct hegemony, stealing millions of jobs from the United States through commercial practices, posing a real threat to the American people; and the CCP took away all the freedoms of the HongKongers through the Hong Kong National Security Law, breaking its promise of 50 years of freedom for Hong Kong.

**司法部长Barr今天正式辞职**

**Attorney General Barr Officially Resigned Today**

川普总统随后任命了代理司法部长Jeffrey A. Rosen及其助手Richard Donoghue，确保司法部下一步行动在总统掌控之中。所有各州将在12月14日进行选举人投票，并由选举人签字证明选举结果，这意味着司法部将在这天拿到坐实选举舞弊的各州签字证据。12月15日以后，司法部的一系列行动就要开始。据路德了解，几个与拜登相关的重要人士已经被抓。

Barr原为老布什政府的司法部长，在川普内阁再次上任是各派妥协的结果，主要任务是完成通俄门调查。现在司法部重心转入灭共，Barr因为自己的利益纠葛，其身份已不再适合继续留任。

President Trump then appointed Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen and his aide Richard Donoghue to ensure that the Justice Department’s next move is under the president’s control. All states will conduct their electoral votes on Dec. 14, and the election results will be certified by their signatures, which means that the Department of Justice will obtain the signed evidences that substantiate election fraud from these states on this date. After Dec. 15, a series of actions by the Department of Justice will begin. According to LuDe Media, several significant figures related to Biden have been arrested.

Barr was formerly the Attorney General in the old Bush administration, and his reappointment in the Trump cabinet was the result of a compromise between various factions, with the main task to complete the Russia-gate investigation. Now that the focus of the Department of Justice has shifted to extinguishing the CCP, Barr’s status is no longer suitable to remain in office because of his own entangled interests.

**Rosen****上任第一天就给亨特拜登发出了24张刑事传票**

**Rosen Issued 24 Criminal Summonses to Hunter Biden on His First Day in Power**

所有左媒随Barr的辞职来了个180度大转向，一致报道亨特拜登与中共的勾兑，表明民主党正在抛弃乔拜登，将推出贺锦丽来填补总统候选人的空缺，而贺锦丽正是中共背后藏的那把刀。

With Barr’s resignation, all the leftist media made a 180 degree turn and unanimously reported Hunter Biden’s collusion with the Chinese Communist Party, indicating that the Democratic Party is abandoning Joe Biden and will introduce Kamala Harris to fill the vacancy of the presidential candidate, but Harris is the very knife hiding behind the Chinese Communist Party.

**WHO****总干事谭德塞被指控为群体灭绝罪**

**WHO Director General Tedros Charged with Mass Genocide**

曾获诺贝尔奖提名的美国经济学家David Stenman，近日向国际刑事法院起诉谭德塞犯有群体灭绝罪。谭德塞2005-2016年担任埃塞俄比亚卫生部长、外交部长，其所领导的组织提格里人民解放阵线（TPLF）被美国政府列为全球恐怖组织。谭德塞在2013-2015年间为控制该国安全部门的三大领袖之一，为政府的谋杀、酷刑、滥捕、抢地等暴行负责。

David Stenman, a Nobel Prize-nominated American economist, recently filed an indictment with the International Criminal Court against Tedros for mass genocide. Tedros served as Ethiopia’s Minister of Health and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2005-2016, and had led the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which is listed as a global terrorist organization by the United States. Tedros was one of the three leaders who controlled Ethiopian security services from 2013-2015 and was responsible for the government’s murder, torture, indiscriminate arrests, land grabbing and other atrocities.
