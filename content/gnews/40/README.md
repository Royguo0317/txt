President Donald J. Trump, Sudanese Chairman of the Sovereignty Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke today to discuss Sudan’s historic progress towards democracy and opportunities to advance peace in the region.

唐纳德·J·川普总统和苏丹主权委员会主席阿卜杜勒·法塔赫·布尔汉，苏丹总理阿卜杜拉·哈姆多克以及以色列总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡在今天发表了讲话，讨论了苏丹在实现民主方面的历史性进步以及能够促进该地区和平的机会。

After decades of living under a brutal dictatorship, the people of Sudan are finally taking charge. The Sudanese transitional government has demonstrated its courage and commitment to combating terrorism, building its democratic institutions, and improving its relations with its neighbors.

在残酷的独裁统治下生活了几十年之后，苏丹人民终于由自己掌握了国家权力。苏丹过渡政府在打击恐怖主义，建立民主制度和改善与邻国关系等问题上上证明了他们的勇气与承诺。

In light of this historic progress, and following President Trump’s decision to remove Sudan from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, the United States and Israel agreed to partner with Sudan in its new start and ensure that it is fully integrated into the international community.

鉴于这一历史性进展，和川普总统将苏丹从“国家恐怖主义赞助国”名单中删除这一决定，美国和以色列同意与苏丹合作，以确保苏丹能够完全融入国际社会。

The United States will take steps to restore Sudan’s sovereign immunity and to engage its international partners to reduce Sudan’s debt burdens, including advancing discussions on debt forgiveness consistent with the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.

美国将逐步采取措施以恢复苏丹的主权豁免权，并与其国际伙伴合作，减轻苏丹的债务负担，包括根据《重债穷国倡议》推进有关债务免除的讨论。

The United States and Israel also committed to working with their partners to support the people of Sudan in strengthening their democracy, improving food security, countering terrorism and extremism, and tapping into their economic potential.

美国和以色列还承诺与合作伙伴一道，支持苏丹人民加强其民主体制，改善粮食安全，打击恐怖主义和极端主义并挖掘其经济潜力。

The leaders agreed to the normalization of relations between Sudan and Israel and to end the state of belligerence between their nations. In addition, the leaders agreed to begin economic and trade relations, with an initial focus on agriculture.

两国领导人同意实现苏丹与以色列之间的外交关系正常化，并结束两国之间的交战状态。此外，两国领导人也同意以农业作为切入点开始建立双边经贸关系。

The leaders also agreed that delegations will meet in the coming weeks to negotiate agreements of cooperation in those areas as well as in agriculture technology, aviation, migration issues and other areas for the benefit of the two peoples.

两国领导人还商定，各代表团将在未来几周举行会议，商讨两国在这些领域的合作，此外还包括农业技术，航空，移民问题和其他领域的合作，以造福两国人民。

The leaders also resolved to work together to build a better future and advance the cause of peace in the region. This move will improve regional security and unlock new opportunities for the people of Sudan, Israel, the Middle East, and Africa.

两国领导人还决心共同努力，共创美好未来，促进该地区的和平事业。此举将改善区域安全，并为苏丹，以色列，中东和非洲人民创造新的机会。

This historic agreement is a testament to the bold and visionary approach of the four leaders. Prime Minister Netanyahu, Chairman al-Burhan, and Prime Minister Hamdok expressed their appreciation for President Trump for his pragmatic and unique approach to ending old conflicts and building a future of peace and opportunity for all the people of the region.

这一历史性协议证明了四位领导人的魄力和远见。川普总统为结束该地区由来已久的冲突，为该地区所有人民构建和平与充满机遇的未来而采取了务实且独辟蹊径的做法，内塔尼亚胡总理，布尔汉主席和哈姆多克总理对此表示赞赏。
