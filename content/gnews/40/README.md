**美日会谈达成秘密经济协议继续****QE  ****中共伺机囤积黄金**

**US and Japan Have Reached a Secret Agreement to Continue Their QE**

哎呀，兄弟姐妹们，这几天大家看到都在关注什么事件啊？大家注意着几个问题呀，兄弟姐妹们，7哥可以今天在这儿说世界即将迎来人类有史上最大的通货膨胀，严格讲叫“恶性通货膨胀”。过去这些天发生这个事儿对共产党的这个整个政策调整你就看得出来。咱的目的就是灭共，咱拯救不了全人类的经济，但是世界的经济的动荡，它绝对地直接地影响我们灭共的步伐。那么大家看到发生什么事情？

Ah. Brothers and sisters, what events have caught your attention these days? There are a few things you should be aware of, brothers and sisters. Your Brother Miles can say here that the world is on the verge of the most significant inflation in the history of humankind, technically called hyperinflation. The policy adjustment that has taken place in the last two weeks towards the CCP is evident. Our focused goal is destroying the CCP. We cannot save the entire human economy, but the economic turmoil of the world will directly impact the pace of taking down the CCP. Have you noticed what has happened?

过去这几天，美国拜登总统和日本的首相菅义伟的见面，发生了什么事情？这俩国家印钞现在都印得非常厉害，印钞印得可以说是两个印钞大国，学术上叫QE。QE严格讲就是放的假屁，就是放的假屁，就是骗人的屁，实际上就是印钞票。日本、美国都将迎来巨大的通货膨胀及恶性通货膨胀期。

What happened at the meeting between the US President Biden and Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga in the past few days? Both countries have seriously over-issued money, so we can call both countries as big “money printing” countries. Technically this is called QE (quantitative easing). Strictly speaking, QE is nothing but cheating, and it simply means printing money. Both the US and Japan will usher in a period of colossal inflation and hyperinflation.

这两人的见面，两事儿诞生了。第一个，亚洲的“小池塘”，本来是中共以为自己是老大：我是鳄鱼，“小池塘”里的鳄鱼，美国不别碰。它以为已经完成了，七哥以前说过，完成了，亚洲我是老大，你美国别碰，欧洲别碰，这个小池塘是我说了算。大西洋，这个美国这块儿我给你 negotiation 一下，看看能不能也有我一席之地？现在亚洲的“小池塘”里边儿出了仨鳄鱼：印度、日本，还有中共自己。

When the two (Biden and Yoshihide Suga) met, two things happened. First, the CCP used to believe that it is the crocodile (the boss) of the “small pond” (Asia), so the US is not allowed to touch this place. The CCP believed that this was a sure thing already. As I, your Brother Miles told you before, the CCP believes that it has become the “Asian hegemon”. According to the CCP, the US should not interfere, Europe should not interfere, and Asia is exclusively the CCP’s territory. With regards to the Atlantic sphere of interest, the CCP is also trying to convince the US to allow it to share some of the profits there. However, there are now three crocodiles in the “small pond” of Asia: India, Japan, and the CCP.

它以为自己说了算了，但是菅义伟和美国的见面，这一次就证明了亚洲，中共已经说了不算了。日本现在已经平衡做老大。印度肯定不服啊，印度说：那我也是老大，是吧？这仨这是亚洲的“池塘之争”已经开始。

The CCP thought that it was already in charge of Asia, but the meeting between Yoshihide Suga and the US proved that the CCP no longer is. Japan has now emerged as the other boss to balance the power in Asia. India may not be convinced though because India thinks it should also be a boss too. So, this means that the battle among the three countries has already begun.

第二，大家注意到，美国和日本达成了经济上的各种合作，桌子底下的协议，那就是你也印我也印，印钞票。你看这就是共产党已经早前得到了情报，共产党干了什么？最近大量的买进黄金，大量的在国内禁止黄金交易，大量的国企在外面悄悄地买黄金和黄金的一些金矿的股份。我的好朋友两个拥有金矿控股权的，最近以高出几倍的价格把金矿控股权转让给了华字头的海外公司。大家看明白了吧？

Secondly, you should notice that the US and Japan have secretly reached agreements under the table to cooperate in economy. That is we can both keep printing money. When the CCP became aware of this, what did they do? The CCP recently started to purchase large amounts of gold and imposed a widespread ban on gold trading among individuals in mainland China. At the same time, many state-owned companies secretly purchased gold and obtained shares of gold mines overseas. Two good friends of mine, who owned controlling stakes in gold mines, recently transferred their stakes to CCP-owned overseas companies at prices several times higher than market price. Do you understand what I mean?

所以说这个时候，你家里存点黄金没有用的，就黄金涨一倍你那么多有啥用啊？你兑现很难，千万不要乱买黄金。黄金根本不是你能买的玩意儿。你真有闲钱闲的怕老鼠咬了你才买点儿黄金，否则你不要去买那玩意儿，没用的。那么这是国家战略的东西，国与国之间。对我们老百姓没用，但是对咱G系列它就管用了，我们20%的钱去买黄金那就管用了，是吧？所以说看到这个大的变化。

But remember it is useless for you to keep gold at home. Even if the price of gold doubles, you won’t benefit from it. So what is the use, right? Besides, it is very inconvenient to exchange gold back into cash. So, I would not recommend that individuals buy gold because gold is not an investment asset for ordinary people. Only if you have large amounts of idle cash would it make sense to buy gold. Otherwise, don’t do it. It is useless. Gold is a strategic asset for countries to trade, not for ordinary people. But it is useful for our G-Series. We use 20% of our G-Coin money to buy gold, and that will work for our purpose. Right? You need be aware of this important global trend.
