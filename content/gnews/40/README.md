**摘要：在2021年4月30日的盖特视频中，郭先生说他半年之前就预测到了在川普总统竞选失败后，朱利安尼先生会被搜家，但是他说这只是一场大戏的开始，对爆料革命是好事。他透露这次的搜家促使更多的人更热切地要投资GTV，并暗示GTV有重大前景。（难道是有川普总统一类的大人物要加盟GTV吗？）**

**朱利安尼市长的案子是一场大戏的开场**

**Major Giuliani’s House Search Is the Opening of A Big Show**

现在很多王八蛋、欺民贼傻乎乎地庆贺朱利安尼所谓被搜家。在美国，这种官司大家想想。（哟，这风这么大呀）在美国这种官司大家记住啊，打的是什么？打的是钱。你见过在美国哪个官员被另外一个官员陷害进监狱吗？我告诉你：[如果有]，那是[因为]你真有事儿。

Now many bastards and pro-democracy phonies are so stupid to celebrate the so-called raiding of Giuliani’s home. In the United States, think about this kind of lawsuit – oh, it’s so windy – remember everyone. What is this kind of lawsuit in the U.S. fighting for? It’s money. Have you ever seen an official in the U.S. who was framed by another official and sent to jail? I tell you: if this happened, it is because you really did it.

[虽然对]朱利安尼[出手]，[但]打[击]的[目标]绝对不是朱利安尼，是美国真正的海外代理案的乌克兰，乌克兰！对咱们爆料革命太好了，为什么呀？[因为]他们越查朱利安尼，去搜个家算个鸟事儿啊？在美国谁没被“搜”过家呀？搜家[意味着]什么？[说明]他们就越要斗，越斗越反抗，对咱们灭共[事业]越关键，越好。

Although the strike is on Giuliani, but the target is definitely not Giuliani, it’s Ukraine, Ukraine, which is a real U.S. overseas agency case. It will be great for our Whistleblower Movement. Why? Note that the house search is nothing. Who hasn’t been “searched” in the U.S.? What does the house search mean? It means the more they search for Giuliani, the more he will fight, and the more resist it will result in. These are very critical and great for taking down the CCP.

另外拜登案子，朱利安尼案子一查，美国各个案子都出来了，对咱们是好事。你说那些欺民贼，这些脑子装了狗屎的东西他们有一次[的]高兴，所谓[他们的]幸灾乐祸正确过吗？昨天有战友说：“啊，他们幸灾乐祸！”我说幸灾乐祸你见过海外的这些欺民贼们，伪类们有一次幸灾乐祸正确过吗？从来没有过！他们如果有这个本事也算我们能看的起他[们]了。为什么？因为他[们]对世界一无所知！

In addition, once the Biden case and the Giuliani case are investigated, all [the related] cases in the United States will surface. This is actually good for us. You have seen how those pro-democracy phonies whose brain is filled with sh\*t got so excited [when they saw Giuliani’s case]? Yesterday a fellow fighter said: “Ah, they are gloating!” I asked, I asked, “Have you ever seen these overseas pro-democracy phonies get anything right for just once when they are gloating?” Never had! If they have this ability, we can give them the respect that they deserve. Why? Because they know nothing about the world!

真正的大戏，这才是大戏呢，我们喜欢这种大戏的开始。对爆料革命就要借势，要会借势。结果是，朱利安尼家一被搜，好多人要更加和我们合作。就像喜联储、喜Dollar、喜美元一样、喜币一样。为什么？为什么呢？为什么呢？战友们想想，想想。咱不想说人家的麻烦就是咱[们]的机会。

It really is a big show, and we like the opening of this big show. Our Whistleblower Movement must take advantage of the situation. As soon as Giuliani’s house was searched, many people more urgently wanted to cooperate with us, with the Himalaya Exchange, H-Dollar, and H-Coin. Why? Why? Why? Think about it, fellow fighters! We don’t want to say that other people’s trouble is our opportunity.

所以这两天七哥忙大了，所有人[跟我联系的]都想投[资]咱们的喜美元，喜币，想参与合作。更多人想投G-TV，新G-TV。为什么？为什么？G-TV能干啥，战友们，能干啥？想想啊。

So the past two days, your Brother Miles has really been busy. Everyone wanted to invest in our H-Dollar, H-Coin, and wanted to cooperate with us. Even more people wanted to invest in G-TV, the new G-TV. Why? Why? What can G-TV do, fellow fighters? What can it do?

还有，朱利安尼家里一被搜，6个月前，[可能]还不止了，[应该]是6个月前吧，大概在大选完之后，我说：如果川普总统当不上总统，我说：“朱利安尼老爷子，不会超过6个月，一定会搜你家。而且一定会查你什么案子。”他当时还说呢：“不可能，绝对不可能！”就是那次抽烟那次，结果他家被搜[查]了，被抄了吧？一定会被抄的，是吧？

Also, about Giuliani’s house search, about 6 months ago or even earlier, probably after the election, I said that if President Trump were not elected, Giuliani’s house would be searched in less than 6 months and he would be investigated. At that time, he said: “Impossible, absolutely impossible!” He said that when we smoked together. So now you see his home has been searched, right? Of course it would be searched, right?

七哥在美国也待了几年了，7哥了解人与人之间关系的本性，了解资本的本性。七哥从小看着共产党耍流氓，玩政治玩[了]这么多年，七哥了解他们。七哥的朋友当中政治家多，军事家多，经济家多，严格讲大流氓也多。是吧？所以说七哥[这件事儿上也]说对啦！

You Brother Miles has lived in the U.S. for a few years and I understand the nature of the relationship between people and the nature of capital. Brother Miles grew up watching the CCP play hooligans and play politics for too many years, so I know them. Among my friends, there are many politicians, military strategists, economists, and, strictly speaking, many gangsters too. Right? So I am right this time again!

所以他第一个给我发信息：“真的搜我家啦，你太厉害了！”我说：“恭喜你，恭喜你。搜你家是个好事儿，不是坏事。啊。”[朱利安尼]老爷子最后那点儿余力啊，他一定会在更加激烈的斗争当中[迸发的]，因为它是本能。有了这种麻烦[基于]本能，他本能的斗争就会有另外一个结果出来，不管他[本人]如何，都会有结果出来。这种结果对爆料革命都是好的，你们懂的！

[After the incident], he sent me a message right away: “They really searched my house. You are right!” I said: “Congratulations! Congratulations! Searching for your house is a good thing, not a bad thing.” Giuliani, this old man’s remaining energy will definitely burst in a more intense fight, because it is one’s instinctive reaction. Because of one’s instinctive reaction to troubles, his fight will lead to a very different result. No matter what, there will be an outcome, and this outcome will only be good for our Whistleblower Movement, you know.
