1. 美国将很快将定义中共为跨国犯罪组织 该消息印证了，为什么这两天美国媒体风向大变，先是国家情报总监称中国是二战后美国最大威胁、然后班农先生称中共是全人类的敌人、然后国家安全顾问呼吁结束马杜罗政权、FOX连续爆料翟东升和芳芳。一切都在美国的计划之中。 这个决定不是川普总统决定的，而是来自于美国国家安全委员会的投票决定。


The America will soon officially define the Chinese Communist Party (the CCP) as a transnational criminal organization. This source of information explains the big changes in the U.S. medias these days. First, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) confirmed China as the No.1 threat to America after the World War II. Next, Mr.Bannon claimed that the CCP is the enemy of all mankind. National Security Advisor called on people to end the Maduro regime. Fox News shocked audience with its bombshell reports on Xijinping’s Think Tank Di Dongsheng and Fang Fang, the Chinese “honey trap spy” having sexes with U.S. mayors and targeting Democratic politicians. All is in the control and plan of the U.S. It is not decided by President Trump but the result of each ballot by the National Security Council.

- 为什么美国定义中共为跨国犯罪组织？ 中共是犯罪组织，这是事实，但一直被掩盖。三年前，郭先生置生死于不顾，开始惊天爆料，通过海航事件、王健之死、香港反送中、病毒真相、拜登硬盘门、大选舞弊等事件和实锤的证据，以无数内部战友和香港同胞的生命，以全世界一百五十万人中毒死亡的代价，以川普胜选被翻盘的荒谬及海量的证据，终于唤醒美国人，让他们不得不承认中共就是跨国犯罪组织，让他们意识到美国和中共是你死我活的关系，没有退路。


Why America defines the CCP as a transnational criminal organization? It is a fact that the CCP is a criminal organization which has always been covered up by the CCP. Three years ago, Mr. Miles Kwok risking his life launched the great “Whistle-blower Movement”. It is so glad to see that the “Whistle-blower Movement” eventually woke the Americans up, by providing the hard evidence on Hainan Airlines, the truth of the death of Wang Jian, the largest individual shareholder of Hainan Airlines, Hong Kong protests, the truth of the COVID-19, the Hunter Biden’s Drive, the Election fraud and manipulation, etc. Numerous insiders, fellow-fighters of Miles Kwok has made great contribution and even sacrificed their lives like Hong Kong heroes in their protest for democracy. Now American people finally understand that it is a death or live war between the U.S. and the CCP seeing the facts of more than 1,500,000 death from the CCP virus and the stealing of votes from Trump. There is no way out except for fighting.

3. 这一决定意味着什么？ 这一决定，意味着川普政府已经与美国各大利益集团达成了妥协，一致同意灭共。意味着美国对灭共已经做好了必胜的准备，无论中共如何负隅顽抗也无济于事。意味着中共在海外的所有资产彻底被查封。中共也知道自己作恶多端，罪责难逃，清算的这一天终于要来了。

What does this decision mean? It means that the Trump Administration has reached to an agreement with the major interest groups in the U.S. on taking down the CCP. It also means that the U.S. is well prepared for it and has inconvincible confidence. The recalcitrant CCP’s struggling is in vain now. All their assets overseas will be seized. The CCP knows clearly that they will eventually pay back for all the evils they have done and it is time now.
