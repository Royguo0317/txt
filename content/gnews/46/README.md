1213晚间要闻-NewYork Time

**LuDe Media 20201213 Evening News, New York Time**

**美将成立制裁中共专门委员会，美军将进入战备状态**

**U.S. to Establish Special Committee on Sanctions Against CCP & U.S. Military to Enter Operational Readiness**

路德社称据知情人士爆料，经过美国国家安全委员会讨论通过，从明天开始，川普将正式Fire掉Barr和Ray，并任命新的独立检察官（准备正式的大选评估报告）。美国国家安全委员会内部已经认定了中共是跨国犯罪组织，将成立制裁中共的专门委员会，实质性灭掉中共的实力（只是干、不会宣布）。军方将会进入针对中共的战备状态，随后会有戒严、军管等行动。

LuDe Media said according to informed sources, after the U.S. National Security Council discussed and passed, Trump will officially fire off Barr and Ray tomorrow, and appoint a new independent prosecutor (to prepare the final election assessment report). The U.S. National Security Council has internally identified the CCP as a transnational criminal organization, and will set up a special committee to sanction the CCP and substantially extinguish its power (just action, without announcement).  The military will enter a state of war readiness against the CCP, followed by martial law, military control, and other actions.

**此前迟迟没有行动的原因**

**Reasons for Previous Delay of Action**

路德分析，国家情报总监的报告早几天已经出来了，一直在国家安全委员会进行讨论。讨论的焦点是，查封后的中共资产如何分配？国家安全委员会的每一个人都代表了沼泽地背后掌控美国的力量，需要讨价还价瓜分中共资产这个大蛋糕。郭先生直播时说，与这些力量相比，新中国联邦的实力还不够，表明了蛋糕的最后分配方案即将完成。一旦分配方案确定，后面的灭共行动就一马平川了。

此外，中共知道美国将采取行动后，也试图与沼泽地背后力量谈判，但因为中共作恶超过了边界、失去信誉，它开再高的价码也不会有人合作。

LuDe Media analyzed that the Director of National Intelligence’s report was completed a few days ago and has been in discussion at the National Security Council. The discussion focused on how the seized assets of the CCP would be divided. Everyone on the National Security Council represents the forces behind the swamp that control the United States and need to bargain to divide the big cake of seized CCP assets. Mr. Guo said during the live broadcast that the New Federal State of China is not strong enough compared to these forces, which indicates that the final distribution plan for the cake is nearing completion. Once the distribution plan is determined, actions followed to exterminate the CCP will be smooth.

Moreover, knowing that the United States would take actions, the CCP tried to negotiate with the forces behind the swamp, but because the CCP has done evil beyond its borders and lost credibility, no one will cooperate even if it offered a higher price.

**大选评估报告意味着新中国联邦的时代已经到来**

**Election Assessment Report Means the Era of the New Federal State of China Arrived**

大选评估报告一旦正式公布，就意味着分配方案已经确定，意味着必须采取行动，也即意味着新中国联邦的法律地位被美国正式认可。新中国联邦将正式代表中国人，来接收被查封的中共盗国贼资产。

Once the election assessment report officially released, it means that the distribution plan has been determined, and that actions must be taken, as well as that the legal status of the New Federal State of China is officially recognized by the United States. The New Federal State of China will officially represent the Chinese people to receive the seized assets of the CCP kleptocrats.

**美财政部数据库被外国政府支持的黑客攻击**

**U.S. Treasury Database Hacked by Foreign Government-backed Hackers**

国土安全部在回应网络攻击时说，这次攻击是国家行动，但没有点出国家名字。因为一旦点名，就意味着北约必须马上开战。这些黑客训练有素，是通过内外勾结、钓鱼的方式，从Office365的后门攻入数据库。黑客同时攻击的还有商务部下属的国家电信和信息管理局。

In response to the cyber-attack, the Department of Homeland Security said that the attack was a government-backed action, but did not name the country. Once the country is named, NATO must immediately go to war. These hackers were very well trained and attacked the database from a backdoor of Office365 through internal and external collusion and phishing. These hackers also attacked the National Telecommunications and Information Administration under the Department of Commerce.

**200****万名中共党员已经渗透到7.9万个国际机构**

**2 Million CCP Members Penetrated 79,000 International Institutions**

事件在8月份被爆出后，西方国家经过验证，确认这些党员已经渗透到汇丰银行、渣打银行、Airbus、Boeing、RR等公司及众多的国际组织和机构。

After the incident broke in August, Western countries verified and confirmed that these CCP members had penetrated companies such as HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Airbus, Boeing, Rolls Royce and numerous international organizations and institutions.

**网络攻击和党员名单再被曝光，就是为军事行动做铺垫**

**Cyber Attacks and CCP Member List Revealed Again to Set the Stage for Military Action**

中共的网络攻击和党员渗透由来已久，此时再次爆出，就是为美国即将采取的军事行动进行舆论铺垫。

The Chinese Communist Party has a long history of cyberattacks and penetration, and the re-breaking of the story at this time is to set the stage for public opinion on the upcoming U.S. military actions.

**Oracle****跟随Tesla逃离加州**

**Oracle Fled California Following Tesla**

这两家公司都一致从左派大本营加利福尼亚硅谷，搬迁至德州的首府Austin。硅谷元老Oracle用脚投票，坐实了硅谷正在逐渐失去其科技中心的地位。

Both companies relocated from the leftist stronghold of Silicon Valley, California, to the Texas capital of Austin. Oracle, one of the Silicon Valley founders, voted with its feet, confirming that Silicon Valley is losing its status as a technology hub.
