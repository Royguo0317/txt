## III.  Outright Voter Fraud

## 完全的选民欺诈

Outright voter fraud ranges from the large-scale manufacturing of fake ballots, bribery, and dead voters to ballots cast by ineligible voters such as felons and illegal aliens, ballots counted multiple times, and illegal out-of-state voters. Table 3 provides an overview across the six battleground states of the various types of outright voter fraud that have been alleged to be present.

完全的选民欺诈从大规模的制造假选票、贿赂、死人选民到不合格选民如重罪犯和非法移民投出的票，多次计票、非法的外州选民。表3概述了据称在六个战场州中出现的各种选民欺诈。

表3：2020年总统大选中的完全的选民欺诈

图中文字：

行：亚利桑那、佐治亚、密歇根、内华达、宾夕法尼亚、威斯康星

列：贿赂、制造假选票和销毁合法选票、滥用无限期行动受限投票人、不合格选民和多州投票的选民、死人选民和幽灵选民、多次计票、非法的外州选民

√“普遍证据”=“某些证据”

From the figure, we see that different types of fraud may be present in all six states. Let’s more precisely define each of these different types of fraud using examples that are designed to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.

从表中的数字可以看出六个州都可能存在不同类型的欺诈。

让我们运用旨在说明而非面面俱到的例子来更准确地解释每个不同的欺诈类型。

### Bribery

### 贿赂

In a voter fraud context, bribery refers to the corrupt solicitation, acceptance, or transfer of value in exchange for official action, such as voter registration or voting for a preferred candidate. At least in Nevada, there is a slam dunk case that such bribery occurred.

在选民欺诈的背景下，贿赂指的是腐败的诱惑、接收或者以换取选民登记和优先投票某个候选人的官方行动的价值转移。至少在内华达州，有确凿的案件证明这种贿赂的存在。

What is so stunning about the Nevada case is the brazen disregard for our federal bribery laws. In the Silver State, in an effort orchestrated by the Biden campaign, Native Americans appear to have traded their votes not for pieces of silver but rather for Visa gift cards, jewelry, and other “swag.” According to the Epoch Times, such vote buying schemes also may have occurred in eight other states, including Arizona and Wisconsin.

令人震惊的是内华达案件对我们联邦贿赂法的无耻漠视。在银山州，在拜登竞选团队精心策划下，土著印第安人似乎用他们的选票交换到的不是银子而是visa礼品卡、珠宝和其他“礼品”。根据大纪元报道，其他包括亚利桑那和威斯康星等8个州可能也有这样的贿票计划。

### Fake Ballot Manufacturing and Destruction of Legally Cast Real Ballots

### 制造假选票和销毁合法选票

Fake ballot manufacturing involves the fraudulent production of ballots on behalf of a candidate; and one of the most disturbing examples of possible fake ballot manufacturing involves a truck driver who has alleged in a sworn affidavit that he picked up large crates of ballots in New York and delivered them to a polling location in Pennsylvania.  There may be well over 100,000 ballots involved, enough fake ballots alone to have swung the election to Biden in the Keystone State.

制造假票包括为某个候选人伪造选票，伪造选票最令人不安的案例涉及一名卡车司机，他宣誓说把一大箱子的选票从纽约装车拉到了宾夕法尼亚的一个投票点。可能有100，000多张票，单单这些假票就足够翻转大选使拜登在肯斯通州获胜。

Likewise in Pennsylvania, there is both a Declaration and a photo that suggests a poll worker used an unsecured USB flash drive to dump an unusually large cache of votes onto vote tabulation machines. The resultant tabulations did not correlate with the mail-in ballots scanned into the machines.

同样在宾夕法尼亚，有关的声明和照片都表明一个投票工作人员用一个不安全的优盘把大量不寻常的选票拷贝到投票制表机里，导致投票制表与扫描进机器里的邮寄选票不相关。

Arguably the most flagrant example of possible fake ballot manufacturing on behalf of Joe Biden may have occurred at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. The possible perpetrators were caught in flagrante delicto on surveillance video.

在佐治亚的亚特兰大州农场竞技场发生的为拜登制造假选票事件可能是最明目张胆的一个案例，监控录像中显示可能有犯罪人被当场抓获。

In one version of this story, poll watchers and observers as well as the media were asked to leave in the middle of the night after a suspicious water leak. Once the room was cleared, several election officials pulled out large boxes of ballots from underneath a draped table. They then proceeded to tabulate a quantity of fake manufactured ballots estimated to be in the range of tens of thousands. Note that a large surge in Biden votes following the tabulation of these ballots can be clearly observed after these votes were processed.

这个故事的一个版本是这样解释的：发生了可疑的水管漏水后，选举看守人和观察员以及媒体人半夜被要求离开现场。一旦房间没有人后，几个选举官员从一张盖着桌布的桌子下面拖出了几个装票的大箱子。然后他们继续将估计有数万张伪造的选票制成表格。请注意在这些选票被处理制定表之后，可以清楚地观察到拜登的得票数大幅增加。

Despite what appears to be damning evidence of a possible crime, a spate of stories appeared across the anti-Trump media diaspora dismissing any concerns. According to these whitewash stories, these were regular and authorized ballot boxes, observers in the media were not asked to leave but simply left on their own, and it is perfectly acceptable to count ballots in the absence of observers. Or so the spin goes.

尽管证据确凿表明这是一桩可能的犯罪，但是反川普媒体上出现大量的驳斥任何担忧的文章。根据这些为选民欺诈洗白的文章，这些箱子是合格的经过核准的投票箱，媒体观察员未被要求离开是他们自行离开的，而且观察员不在场的情况下计票是完全可以接收的。或者说媒体就是这样宣传的。

Of course, this is precisely the kind of incident that should be fully investigated both by Georgia’s Attorney General as well as by the Federal Department of Justice. Yet it remains unclear as to whether such investigations are underway. Meanwhile, the videotape itself, absent an adequate explanation, has contributed to the current climate of skepticism surrounding the fairness and integrity of the election.

当然，这类事件确切地说应该由乔治亚州的检察长和联邦司法部共同进行全面调查。然而现在仍不清楚是否正在进行这样的调查。同时，录像带本身缺乏足够的解释也助长了当前围绕大选的公正性和完整性的怀疑气氛。

Finally, as an example of the possible destruction of legally cast real ballots there is this allegation from a court case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona: Plaintiffs claim that over 75,000 absentee ballots were reported as unreturned when they were actually returned. These absentee ballots were then either lost or destroyed (consistent with allegations of Trump ballot destruction) and/or were replaced with blank ballots filled out by election workers or other third parties。

最后，美国亚利桑那州地区法院受理的一宗案件中的指控证实了可能销毁合法真选票的案例：被告称根据记录75，000多张缺席选票未被归还，实际上已归还。这些缺席选票后来或者丢失或者被销毁（符合川普的选票被销毁的指控）并且/或者由选举工作人员或者第三组织填写的空白选票代替。

### Indefinitely Confined Voter Abuses

### 滥用无限期行动受限投票人

Indefinitely confined voters are those voters unable to vote in person because of old age or some disability. There are two types of possible abuses associated with such indefinitely confined voters.

无限期行动受限投票人是指那些因年龄高或者残疾的缘故而无法亲自投票的人。有两种滥用情况跟这类无限期行动受限者有关。

The first kind of abuse involves exploiting the elderly or the infirm by effectively hijacking their identities and votes. For example, in Georgia, the family of an elderly man in a nursing home facility discovered that a mail-in ballot had been requested and submitted under his voter registration identity, yet it was done without his consent. In a similar situation in Pennsylvania, two parents and their daughter who has Downs Syndrome went to vote in person and discovered that a mail-in ballot had both been requested and submitted for the daughter without her consent.

第一种情况是利用身份和选票被黑客的老年人和残疾者选民。滥用涉及到老年人或体弱者的身份和选票利用。举个例子，在佐治亚州，住在疗养院的一名老人的家人发现，有人以老人的选民登记身份请求并邮寄了选票，但此举未经他的同意。在宾夕法尼亚州有个类似的情况，两名父母和患有唐氏综合症的女儿亲自去投票时发现在未经女儿同意的情况下，有人已经请求并提交了邮寄选票。

The second kind of indefinitely confined voter abuse is far more consequential, at least in the state of Wisconsin. The key allegation here in several court filings is that “bad-faith voters” registering as “indefinitely confined” intentionally broke “Wisconsin election law to circumvent election integrity photo identification requirements.” In a nutshell, they were able to vote without showing a voter identification photo and therefore underwent a far less rigorous I.D. check than would otherwise have been conducted.

第二种滥用无限期行动受限投票人的后果要严重得多，至少是在威斯康星州。几份法院文件中的关键指控是，那些注册为“无限期行动受限”的“恶意选民”故意违反了“威斯康星州选举法，以规避选举完整性照片识别要求。” 简而言之，他们经历了比原本应该严格执行的宽松的多的检查，因此能够在不出示选民证件照片的情况下进行投票。

This abuse happened, according to one press account, after “clerks in Dane and Milwaukee counties offered illegal advice that encouraged individuals to use indefinite confinement as a way to ignore the state’s photo I.D. requirement.”The Trump side has called this correctly an open invitation to fraud; and stories and pictures abound of Wisconsin voters who registered as indefinitely confined but were seen also attending weddings, riding their bikes, going on vacation, and otherwise be anything but confined.

据一份新闻报道称，这种滥用发生在“戴恩县(Dane)和密尔沃基县(Milwaukee)的职员提出非法建议，鼓励人们通过使用无限期行动受限来无视该州的身份照片要求“之后。川普方面已正确地将此称为欺诈的公开邀请。威斯康星州选民注册了无限期行动限制而被发现参加婚礼，骑行，外出度假的故事和图片比比皆是，而注册了本来是只能是限制行动的。

Here is what is most important about this particular type of election fraud: In the wake of the expanded definition of indefinitely confined voters – a definition ruled legally incorrect by the Wisconsin Supreme Court – the number of indefinitely confined voters surged from just under 70,000 voters in 2019 to over 200,000 in 2020.26 This 130,000 vote increment of new indefinitely confined voters is more than five times the Biden victory margin in Wisconsin.

这种特定类型的选举欺诈的重点在于：随着对无限期行动受限投票人的定义的扩大（威斯康星州最高法院裁定该定义在法律上不正确），无限期行动受限投票人的数量从2019年的不到70,000名激增到2020年的200,000多。这新增的130，000无限期行动受限投票人的选票是拜登在威斯康星州获胜超出的选票五倍多。

### Ineligible Voters and Voters Who Voted in Multiple States

### 不合格选民和在多州投票的选民

Ineligible voters include felons deemed ineligible, underage citizens, nonregistered voters, illegal aliens, illegal out-of-state voters, and voters illegally using a post office box as an address.

不合格的选民包括被认为不合格的重罪犯，未成年公民，未登记的选民，非法移民，非法的州外选民和非法使用邮局信箱作为地址的选民。

In a court filing by the Trump campaign legal team, lead counsel Ray Smith provided a list of more than 70,000 allegedly ineligible voters casting ballots in Georgia in the 2020 election. Also in Georgia, over 20,000 people appear to have filed a Notice of Changed Address form to the Georgia state government or had other indications of moving out of state. Yet, these clearly ineligible out-of-state voters appeared to have remained on the voter rolls and voted in the 2020 election.

在川普竞选法律团队的法庭文件中，首席律师雷·史密斯（Ray Smith）提供了一份2020年大选期间，佐治亚州所称的70，000多名进行投票的不合格投票者的名单。同样在佐治亚州，有20,000多人似乎已向州政府提交地址变更通知书，或有其他迹象表明要搬离此州。 然而，这些显然没有资格的州外选民似乎仍然留在选民名单上并在2020年大选中投了票.

As additional data points regarding ineligible out-of-state voters, there are these: Between 80 and 100 self-proclaimed Black Lives Matter-affiliated members from other states have admitted to having voted in Pennsylvania.

还有更多有关不合格州外选民的数据：来自其他州的80至100个自称隶属于黑命贵组织的成员已承认在宾夕法尼亚州投票。

As for those voters who vote in multiple states, one lawsuit claims that roughly 15,000 mail-in or absentee ballots were received in Nevada from voters who were known to have voted in other states. It is useful to note here that in Nevada, poll workers allegedly were not consistent in their procedures when checking voters in to vote about whether they accepted California or Nevada Voter Identification as proof of eligibility to register to vote.

关于在多个州进行投票的选民，一项诉讼声称内华达州收到了大约15,000份邮寄或缺席选票，而这些投票人据知已在其他州投过票。在此有必要指出，在内华达州，据称，投票站工作人员在检查选民登记投票时关于是否接受加利福尼亚州或内华达州选民身份作为登记投票资格的证明时，他们的程序不一致。

### Dead Voters and Ghost Voters

### 死人选民和幽灵选民

According to widespread evidence, there was a surprising number of ballots cast across several key battleground states by deceased voters, sparking one wag to quip, in reference to a classic Bruce Willis movie, this was the “Sixth Sense” election – I see dead people voting.

In Pennsylvania, for example, a statistical analysis conducted by the Trump Campaign matching voter rolls to public obituaries found what appears to be over 8,000 confirmed dead voters successfully casting mail-in ballots. In Georgia – underscoring the critical role any given category of election irregularities might play in determining the outcome – the estimated number of alleged deceased individuals casting votes almost exactly equals the Biden victory margin.

广泛的证据表明，已故的选民在几个关键战场州有着惊人数量的投票，引用布鲁斯·威利斯(Bruce Willis)的一部经典电影来打趣一下，这是“第六感”选举–我看到死者在投票。

例如，在宾夕法尼亚州，由川普竞选团队进行的统计分析将选民和公开讣告进行了比对，发现似乎有8,000多名已确认的死亡选民成功投了邮寄选票。在佐治亚州 – 凸显了选举违规中的任何一条都能改变选举结果 – 估计的据称已故投票人士的投票量几乎完全等于拜登的胜出的选票量。

In Michigan, according to one first-hand account offered in a declaration, computer operators at a polling location in Detroit were manually adding the names and addresses of thousands of ballots to vote tabulation systems with voters who had birth dates in 1900. And in Nevada, a widower since 2017 saw that his deceased wife had successfully cast a mail-in ballot on November 2, 2020, three and a half years after her death.

在密歇根州，根据一份声明中提供的第一手资料，底特律一个投票地点的计算机操作员正在将成千上万张出生日期为1900年的选民的名称和地址手动添加到制表系统里。在内华达州，一位鳏夫，在妻子去世三年半后的2020年11月2日发现已故的妻子成功进行了邮寄选票。

It may be useful to note here that dead voters played a critical role in stealing the election from Richard Nixon, a theft orchestrated by Mayor Richard Daley and his Chicago political machine. According to one report “more than 3,000 votes [were] cast in the names of individuals who were dead, and more than 31,000 individuals voted twice in different locations in the city.” President Kennedy’s victory margin in Illinois was less than 9,000 votes.

在这里可能需要指出的是，死人选民在窃取理查德·尼克松(Richard Nixon)的选举中起着关键作用，这是由市长理查德·戴利(Richard Daley)及其芝加哥政治机构精心策划的一起盗窃案。 根据一份报告称 “超过3,000张投票是已故的人所投，超过31,000人在城市的不同地方投票了两次。” 肯尼迪总统在伊利诺伊州的胜出的选票不到9,000票。

On the Ghost Voter front, a “Ghost Voter” is a voter who requests and submits a ballot under the name of a voter who no longer resides at the address where that voter was registered. In Georgia for example, it is alleged that over 20,000 absentee or early voters – almost twice the Biden victory margin – cast their ballots after having moved out of state. In Nevada, a poll worker reported that there were as many as 50 ballots per day being delivered to homes vacated by their former residents.

在“幽灵选民”方面，“幽灵选民”是指以不再居住在该选民注册地址的选民的名义请求和提交选票的选民。例如，在佐治亚州，据称超过20,000名缺席者或早期选民-几乎是拜登胜出选票量的两倍 – 在搬离本州后投票。 在内华达州，一名投票站工作人员报告说，每天有多达50张选票被运送到被前居住者腾空的房屋中。

### Counting Ballots Multiple Times

### 多次计票

Counting ballots multiple times occurs most egregiously when batches of ballots are repeatedly rescanned and re-tabulated in electronic voting machines. It can also happen when the same person votes multiple times within the same day. Evidence of these particular kinds of “ballot stuffing” are present across all six battleground states.

多次计票最过份的是当在电子投票机反复重新扫描成批的选票并重新制表。当同一个人在同一天内多次投票时，也会发生这种情况。 在所有六个战场州中都存在这种特殊类型的“选票填充”证据。

For example, in Wisconsin, poll workers were observed running ballots through tabulation machines more than once. In Wayne County, Michigan, Republican poll watchers observed canvassers re-scanning batches of ballots through vote tabulation machines up to 3 to 4 times.

例如，在威斯康星州，投票站工作人员被观察到不止一次通过制表机进行投票。在密歇根州韦恩(Wayne)县，共和党投票站观察员观察到，布票员通过投票制表机重新扫描了多达3-4次多批次的选票。

In Pennsylvania, a poll worker observed a woman vote twice in the same day by changing her appearance. Another poll worker observed people in voting lines in one corner of a polling location voting, and then coming to another polling location at the other side of the building to vote. Still another poll worker witnessed a woman voting twice at voting machines on Election Day.

在宾夕法尼亚州，一名投票站工作人员观察到一名妇女通过改变自己的外表在一天内进行了两次投票。 另一名投票站工作人员观察到了人们排队在投票站的一个角落投票，然后来到投票站另一侧的一个投票点再次投票。还有一名投票站工作人员目睹一名妇女在选举日时在投票机上投了两次票。
