**简述：在2021年4月12日的盖特视频中，郭先生分析说美国前国务卿克里即将对中共国的访问，与珍珠港袭击之前美国发给日本《赫尔备忘录》[1]有异曲同工之妙。尽管克里跟中共有很亲密的关系以及可能跟中共勾兑，但是他这次访问，必须向中共传达以下三个信息：警告中共不准袭击台湾；要求中共尽快将军队和警察撤离香港；并且向全世界公布病毒的真相。美国经济将会经历起伏，但是最终会变得更加强大。中共和习近平是现代版的纳粹和希特勒，但是当今的世界有新中国联邦、郭先生，以及众多的爆料革命战友们一起来对抗他们的疯狂。**

**克里访问中共国与二战美国给日本的《赫尔备忘录》**

**John Kerry’s Trip to China and the Hull Note in WWII**

美国的前国务卿John Kerry，咱们中文叫克里。(他)要马上访问北京，做为拜登特使要访问北京。(他到北京)干啥去咧？你想想去干啥去咧？在这个之前，我想大家好好看看就是我昨天说的1941年11月份，在二战前，日本偷袭美国珍珠港前，美国发的赫尔备忘录(Hull note)。（美国当时）通知日本必须限多少天要从中国–当时的中国我们的中国啊–全面撤军，无条件（撤军），必须撤。

Have you heard that former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will soon visit Beijing as President Biden’s special envoy? What is the purpose of Kerry’s trip to Beijing? Before addressing that, I would recommend everyone to watch my live broadcast video yesterday referring to the “Hull note” (the “Outline of Proposed Basis for Agreement Between the United States and Japan”). The U.S. government issued the Memo in November 1941, just before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II. Then the U.S. demanded Japan to withdraw its troops unconditionally from China (note that at that time China still belonged to the people of China) within a certain time frame.

当然（日本）天皇，山本五十六这些人都不撤了，是吧？但是在这个之前，美国最起码派出过三波人就像克里一样去游说。告诉你(日本)啊：你赶快撤啊，再一个，你(日本)别想着在东南亚动我(美国)的奶酪。没想到（日本）咣叽一下打珍珠岛去了，这都是历史啊，(跟)大家好好说一说。

Of course, the Japanese emperor and Yamamoto Isoroku didn’t do it, did they? But before that, the U.S. sent at least three groups of people to mediate, pretty much like what Kerry is going to do. The U.S. warned Japan to withdraw its troops immediately, and warned Japan not to try to touch U.S. interests in Southeast Asia. Yet, the U.S. did not expect Japan’s sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. It is part of history. Let’s have a good chat about history today.

说到这儿的时候大家知道(我)这几天这个到任何地方不谈灭共都不好意思了，（否则）基本都没人理你了，每天的变化就这(么大)。所有人一说话说不谈灭共，哎哟我滴娘嘞，不谈灭共那你不时髦啊，是吧？

Do you know, my fellow fighters? These days wherever I go to meet with people, almost nobody wants to interact with me unless the subject of destroying the CCP is on the table. That is how much the conversation has changed. Everyone talks about taking down the CCP when they are handling business. Otherwise, you are behind the curve. Right?

七哥在三年前说（过）灭共是事业，灭共还是生意。现在大家一谈生意不谈灭共，你咋谈生意啊，是吧？你从中国的投资有没有啊？撤回来没有啊？你要没撤回来那我不给你投(资)了啊，因为你这风险太大了，是吧？不像原来似的（你）不在中共投资就没人投资你；现在反了，你在中共有投资那你不撤回来，没人投资你。谈生意还有灭共现在是最时髦的事业，任何人不谈(CCP)，对共产党没点什么理解坐在桌上你没话说了，没话说了。

Brother Miles said three years ago that taking down the CCP was not only a profound obligation, but also a business opportunity. Now there is no possibility for people to talk about business without talking about taking down the CCP. Right? [For example, people raise questions such as:] “Do you still have investments in the CCP market? Have you withdrawn your investment from the CCP? If you have not canceled your involvement with the CCP, I cannot give you my investment because of the high risk.” In the past, if you had no assets in the CCP market, no one would invest with you. Now it is completely reversed. If you still have investments in the CCP market and you have not withdrawn yet, no one will want to invest in your business. Doing business and discussing taking down the CCP are now the most fashionable causes. Anybody who does not talk about the CCP or does not have any understanding about the CCP will not integrate well in most business circles.

所以说这次克里到中国去会(跟CCP)说什么？(第一，)台湾的问题你怎么办？你敢动一定灭你(CCP)；第二，香港的(军队警察)马上给我撤回去，恢复香港原来的(和)英国未（履行）完的合同。(如果)不撤回去，肯定制裁你(CCP)；第三件事情，（关于）冠状病毒（真相），必须说实话。（如果）不说实话，肯定收拾你 — 脱钩甚至开战。信不信？

What will John Kerry say to the CCP on his visit to Beijing? [First, he will ask the CCP,] “How to deal with Taiwan? If you dare to attack Taiwan, we will destroy you.” Second, he will tell the CCP to immediately withdraw its troops and police from Hong Kong and resume the unfulfilled agreement with Britain. If not, the U.S. will impose sanctions. In the end, he will demand the CCP to tell the truth about the coronavirus. If not, the U.S. will decouple, or even go to war with them. Do you believe it?

但是克里这个人不值得信(任)，（因为）这个人和中共是非常非常亲近的。克里我知道他太多(事情)了，(他家)原来就住在我北面嘛。他女朋友是原来美国第一任小姐啊。(他女朋友)是我朋友，非常漂亮的一个美女，拍过电影。很早我就去过他(克里)家，她(克里女朋友)家，我都去过，都去过。（我）很了解他。但是呢，民主党这回派他去，拜登派他去，中间(和CCP)会有勾兑，会有勾兑。（比如）扣扣手啊，捏捏啊，是吧？划拉划拉脸啊（摸摸脸），拍拍肩啊……(克里)会配合(CCP)说一些软话，外交上的话。（他）会给共产党很大的面子，甚至个人之间有这样那样的想法，你懂得啊，你懂的。

However, Kerry is not trustworthy because he is too close to the CCP. I know a lot about him. He used to live not far to the north of my house. His girlfriend was the first “Miss America Pageant” winner, a stunner. She acted in movies. I have been to both of their houses. I know Kerry very well. The Democrats and Biden sent him to China this time. There will be collusion between them. Kerry will go along with [the CCP], uttering soft and diplomatic words. He will give the Communist Party an opportunity to save face. It will involve some dirty dealings between individuals. You know what I mean.

但是，战友们要记住，要传达的信息是一定要传达的。当年美国赫尔备忘录(Hull note)之前也一样，那三人有时候软有时候硬的，最后挡不住(美国的民意)，美国是(民主)国家是民意做决定。

But you must understand, my fellow fighters – Kerry must deliver these messages, he has no alternative. It is very similar to the situation when the U.S. released the Hull note back then. All sides will play it out politically, but nothing can hold back the U.S. public opinion. The U.S. has democracy. Third, it is public opinion that makes the call.

大家现在看一看，（我）先问问战友们：你(们)知道二战前美国的经济啥样吗？二战前的美国的经济啥样知道吗？二战前美国的经济糟透了，大萧条。二战以后美国成了世界的帝国，强国，经济强大。（美国）进入了经济周期每八年一个(涨幅)，越涨越高。现在美国经济最强势，(接下来)一定经济会出问题，经济出了问题就叫大萧条，大萧条的结局就是–灭共！

Let me ask you first: do you know what the U.S. economy was like before World War II? It was terrible. It had suffered through the Great Depression. But after World War II, the U.S. became the world’s empire, the most powerful country with a strong economy. The U.S. entered a virtuous economic cycle, rising every eight years, higher and higher. Now, although it looks strong, it will soon go wrong. Once that happens, the U.S. will suffer a Great Depression again, leading to the destruction of the CCP.

（另外）大家知道二战以前日本经济啥样吗？日本经济非常滴好啊。当时是德国那绝对是(经济最好)，日本(经济)跟德国没法比，德国经济比(日本)好太多了。但是二战之后，德国从来没追上过日本，为啥？就是中国国内(的)傻叉小粉红们（听好了）：只有国家政体稳定，人民安居乐业，不为一个家族或者所谓的一个天皇某几个人服务所操弄的时候，大家才有真正的富裕，真正的强大的机会。这就是当年的日本(强大的原因)，而德国当年被打成那个样子，德国永远没追上过日本，到现在永远不可能追上日本。因为德国虽然稳定了，但是德国(纳粹)当年折腾的太大了。这就是现在的中共国(和当年的德国纳粹一模一样)。

Do you know what the Japanese economy was like before World War II? The Japanese economy was excellent. At that time, Germany was absolutely the best, and the Japanese economy was not comparable to that of Germany. But after World War II, the German economy never caught up with Japan. Why? The brainless fanatics in mainland China, please listen to what I am going to say very carefully – Only when a country’s political system is stable, when ordinary people (Lao Bai Xing) have jobs, a regular life, and only when most people are not serving an elite few families, or an emperor, does the country have a chance to become rich and mighty. This is why Japan was strong. Germany was beaten so badly and never caught up with Japan after its defeat. It still has not, and it will have a hard time doing so. Germany is stable, but the damage and after-effects caused by the German Nazis were too extensive. How similar is today’s CCP to Nazis Germany?

(CCP)这两天说了，不对美国抱有什么希望了，（实际上）你（想）报希望报不成（了）。这次（CCP)吓唬台湾吓到这个程度，全世界也把台湾的问题给推出来了。如果他(CCP)一直说对台湾怎么样怎么样，你(美国和国际社会)还没法说。结果冠状病毒+香港+台湾(一起)，这事大了。全世界想把这个事情压下去都压不下去了。

In the past two days, the CCP has expressed that it no longer expects the U.S. to resume friendly relations anymore. Indeed, they wish it could happen, but there is no chance anymore. This time, the CCP’s grave threat to Taiwan has prompted the world to put this issue on the table. If the CCP had only verbally threatened Taiwan, the U.S., and the international community would not intervene. However, with the combination of the coronavirus, the Hong Kong incident, and the Taiwan issue, the CCP’s crimes cannot be overlooked. There is no way anyone can quietly cover them all up.

(CCP和习近平)就（是）百分之百的现代版的希特勒，纳粹(干的)事情；百分之百的当年日本的侵略，帝国主义，军国主义。当年二战的时候没有新中国联邦啊，没有文贵诞生，所以那个时候人类遭受了那么大的罪 — 哈哈哈（俺这）不要脸啊，俺又不要脸了 — 现在有文贵啊，有新中国联邦，有战友们，所以它(CCP)玩球蛋了。信不信战友们？不管你信不信，时代都会让你知道这是个伟大的时代，属于我们(新中国联邦人)的时代。

The CCP and Xi Jinping are the modern-day Nazis and “Hitler”. We are in a similar situation as with the Japanese invasion, imperialism, and militarism during WWII. World War II was a time of great human suffering because there was no New Federal State of China (NFSC), and Miles had not yet been born. Ha-ha! I am boasting again. I am complimenting myself again. It is different now because people have Miles, the NFSC, and our fellow fighters. So the CCP is over. Fellow fighters, do you believe it? Whether you believe it or not, time will show you the answer. It is destined to be a wonderful era, an era that belongs to the people of the NFSC.

共产党玩球蛋了，共产党你玩球蛋了。走着看，很多好消息我不能说，得Hold住。咱（们)今年不搞重磅，大家走着看。(世界)经济、政治、军事的动荡接踵而来。突发事件：美国、中共、台湾、香港、马六甲海峡，一个接一个(会发生事儿)。世界的焦点全在这儿呢！

The CCP, you are finished. We will see. There is much exciting information I cannot unveil in advance. I have to control myself and not say too much. This year we should not give you many bomb shells. Let’s wait and see. World economic, political, and military upheavals will happen one after another. The U.S., the CCP, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Straits of Malacca are the world’s focuses, and there will be frequent emergencies.
