#### 关于外国干预美国大选时实施某些制裁的行政命令

Issued on: September 12, 2018
2018年9月12日发布

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
根据美利坚合众国宪法，包括《国际紧急经济权力法》（《美国法典》第50编 1701条及以下条款）（简称IEEPA），《国家紧急状态法》（《美国法典》第50编 1601条及以下条款）（简称NEA），《1952年移民和国籍法》（《美国法典》第5编 1182条f款）第212条（f）款，以及《美国法典》第3编301条赋与我的总统权力，

I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the ability of persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States to interfere in or undermine public confidence in United States elections, including through the unauthorized accessing of election and campaign infrastructure or the covert distribution of propaganda and disinformation, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Although there has been no evidence of a foreign power altering the outcome or vote tabulation in any United States election, foreign powers have historically sought to exploit America’s free and open political system. In recent years, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has created significant vulnerabilities and magnified the scope and intensity of the threat of foreign interference, as illustrated in the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment. I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with this threat.
我，美利坚合众国总统唐纳德·J·川普（DONALD J. TRUMP），发现位于美国境外的全部或大部分人有能力干涉或破坏公众对美国选举的信心，包括通过未经授权访问选举和竞选基础设施，或秘密分发宣传和虚假信息，对美国的国家安全和外交政策构成了非同寻常、巨大的威胁。尽管没有证据表明外国势力修改美国大选中的结果和投票表格，但历来外国势力一直在利用美国的自由和开放的政治体系。如2017年情报组织评估所示：近年来，数字设备和网络通信的激增制造了重大漏洞，并扩大了外国干扰威胁的范围和强度。在此，我宣布全国紧急状态以应对这一威胁。

Accordingly, I hereby order:
因此，我在此命令：

Section 1. (a) Not later than 45 days after the conclusion of a United States election, the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the heads of any other appropriate executive departments and agencies (agencies), shall conduct an assessment of any information indicating that a foreign government, or any person acting as an agent of or on behalf of a foreign government, has acted with the intent or purpose of interfering in that election. The assessment shall identify, to the maximum extent ascertainable, the nature of any foreign interference and any methods employed to execute it, the persons involved, and the foreign government or governments that authorized, directed, sponsored, or supported it. The Director of National Intelligence shall deliver this assessment and appropriate supporting information to the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security.
第1条.（a）美国大选结束45天以内，国家情报局局长应与任何其它相关执行部门和机构的负责人协商，对任何显示有外国政府或任何充当外国政府的代理人及代表外国政府的人有干预选举的意图或宗旨的信息进行评估。评估应最大程度地确定任何外国干扰的性质以及执行该干扰所采用的方法，所涉人员以及授权，指示，赞助或支持的外国政府或政府官员。国家情报局局长应将此评估和相关支持信息提供给总统、国务卿、财政部长、国防部长、司法部长和国土安全部长。

(b) Within 45 days of receiving the assessment and information described in section 1(a) of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the heads of any other appropriate agencies and, as appropriate, State and local officials, shall deliver to the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Defense a report evaluating, with respect to the United States election that is the subject of the assessment described in section 1(a):
（b）在收到本命令第1条（a）款所述的评估和信息后45天内，司法部长和国土安全部长应与其它任何相关部门的负责人协商，并酌情与州和地方官员协商，向总统、国务卿、财政部长和国防部长提交一份针对第1条（a）款所述的美国大选的评估报告：
(i) the extent to which any foreign interference that targeted election infrastructure materially affected the security or integrity of that infrastructure, the tabulation of votes, or the timely transmission of election results; and
（i）针对选举基础设施，任何外国干预在多大程度上严重影响了该基础设施的安全性或完整性，选票统计及实时传送选举结果；
(ii) if any foreign interference involved activities targeting the infrastructure of, or pertaining to, a political organization, campaign, or candidate, the extent to which such activities materially affected the security or integrity of that infrastructure, including by unauthorized access to, disclosure or threatened disclosure of, or alteration or falsification of, information or data.
（ii）如果任何外国干扰涉及针对政治组织，竞选活动，候选人，或与之相关的基础设施的活动，则此类活动在多大程度上严重影响了基础设施的安全性或完整性，包括未经授权地访问，披露或威胁披露，更改或篡改信息和数据。
The report shall identify any material issues of fact with respect to these matters that the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are unable to evaluate or reach agreement on at the time the report is submitted. The report shall also include updates and recommendations, when appropriate, regarding remedial actions to be taken by the United States Government, other than the sanctions described in sections 2 and 3 of this order.
报告在提交之时应指出任何司法部长和国土安全部长无法评估或达成协议的重大事实问题。除了该命令第2条和第3条所述的制裁外，该报告还应包括美国政府应适时采取补救措施的更新和提议。

(c) Heads of all relevant agencies shall transmit to the Director of National Intelligence any information relevant to the execution of the Director’s duties pursuant to this order, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. If relevant information emerges after the submission of the report mandated by section 1(a) of this order, the Director, in consultation with the heads of any other appropriate agencies, shall amend the report, as appropriate, and the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall amend the report required by section 1(b), as appropriate.
（c）依照适用的现行法律，所有相关部门的负责人均应在国家情报局长依照该命令履行职责时向其递交任何相关信息。 如果提交本行政命令第1条（a）款授权的报告之后出现相关信息，国家情报局长应与任何其它相关部门负责人协商，相应地修改报告，司法部长和国土安全部长应相应地修改第1条（b）款要求的报告。

(d) Nothing in this order shall prevent the head of any agency or any other appropriate official from tendering to the President, at any time through an appropriate channel, any analysis, information, assessment, or evaluation of foreign interference in a United States election.
（d）此命令中没有任何内容可以阻止任何部门的负责人或任何其它相关官员在任何时候通过适当的渠道，将外国干预美国选举的任何分析、信息、评定或评估提交给总统。

(e) If information indicating that foreign interference in a State, tribal, or local election within the United States has occurred is identified, it may be included, as appropriate, in the assessment mandated by section 1(a) of this order or in the report mandated by section 1(b) of this order, or submitted to the President in an independent report.
（e）如果信息显示外国干涉美国境内的州，部落或地方选举已经发生并且确定，则可相应地将其包括在本命令第1条（a）款授权的评估或第1条（b）款授权的报告中，或以独立报告形式提交给总统 。

(f) Not later than 30 days following the date of this order, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence shall develop a framework for the process that will be used to carry out their respective responsibilities pursuant to this order. The framework, which may be classified in whole or in part, shall focus on ensuring that agencies fulfill their responsibilities pursuant to this order in a manner that maintains methodological consistency; protects law enforcement or other sensitive information and intelligence sources and methods; maintains an appropriate separation between intelligence functions and policy and legal judgments; ensures that efforts to protect electoral processes and institutions are insulated from political bias; and respects the principles of free speech and open debate.
（f）此命令发布后30天内，国务卿、财政部长、司法部长、国土安全部长和国家情报局局长应制定流程框架，以便根据此命令履行其各自的职责。该框架可以全部或部分分类，其重点应是确保各部门按照本命令以一直使用的方式履行其职责；保护执法或其它敏感信息、情报来源和方法；在情报职能与政策和法律判决之间保持适当的隔离；确保保护选举过程和选举机构的努力不受政治偏见的影响；并尊重言论自由和公开辩论的原则。

Sec. 2. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any foreign person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security:

(b) Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015, as amended by Executive Order 13757 of December 28, 2016, remains in effect. This order is not intended to, and does not, serve to limit the Secretary of the Treasury’s discretion to exercise the authorities provided in Executive Order 13694. Where appropriate, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, may exercise the authorities described in Executive Order 13694 or other authorities in conjunction with the Secretary of the Treasury’s exercise of authorities provided in this order.
（b）经2016年12月28日第13757号行政命令修订的2015年4月1日第13694号行政命令仍然有效。该命令无意于也不会限制财政部长行使第13694号行政命令规定的权力酌情权。在适当情况下，财政部长应与司法部长、国务卿协商，可以行使行政命令13694中所述的权力或其它权力，结合此命令所规定的财政部长可行使的权力。

(b) the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the heads of other appropriate agencies, shall jointly prepare a recommendation for the President as to whether additional sanctions against foreign persons may be appropriate in response to the identified foreign interference and in light of the evaluation in the report mandated by section 1(b) of this order, including, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, proposed sanctions with respect to the largest business entities licensed or domiciled in a country whose government authorized, directed, sponsored, or supported election interference, including at least one entity from each of the following sectors: financial services, defense, energy, technology, and transportation (or, if inapplicable to that country’s largest business entities, sectors of comparable strategic significance to that foreign government).

第 4条. 我在此确认，任何根据本命令其财产和财产权利被冻结的人捐赠或接收《国际紧急经济权力法》（《美国法典》第50编1702条（b）款（2）项）第203条（b）款（2）项说明的物品，将严重损害我处理本命令宣布的国家紧急状态的能力，因此，我特此禁止本命令第2条提及的此类捐赠。

Sec. 5. The prohibitions in section 2 of this order include the following:
