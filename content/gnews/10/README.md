【评议者】MIT组第四位评议者马文-赖茨的评议4

RR: C19证据等级评分：

误导（同[【世事解评】闫博士第三篇报告部分内容翻译及浅释](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/1073652/)）

评议：

我对此报告的印象是，它完全由观点和影射构成。闫说，她将提供更多实锤证据，但我很怀疑，毕竟这篇报告拖了很长时间。这个时机非常可疑。


> Response: It is very interesting that, while our report is irrefutably scientific with abundant evidence and analyses put together in a logical manner, all four reviewers here outrageously described our report as “not scientific” and/or just “opinions.” At the same time, the four reviewers provided no valid scientific argument themselves and instead left only unsupported claims, which equal opinions. It is intriguing that the same mistake could be made by each of the four reviewers. This pattern is suspicious and should be investigated.
> 
> Consistent with this pattern, as evidenced below, multiple comments from reviewer 4 are essentially the same as those made by reviewer 3. This is a blunt violation of the rules of peer review as each reviewer is supposed to provide his/her unbiased, independent critical analyses of the manuscript.
> 
> The reviewer also commented that no more concrete data would come from us. Clearly, he had already been proven wrong as our second report, a concrete scientific article, was published on October 8th, 20201, only 14 days after their “review” was published and only 24 days after the publication of our first report.


【闫博士】回应：

很有趣，当我们的报告将大量证据和分析以合乎逻辑的方式综合起来使其具有无可辩驳的科学性时，所有四位评议者都蛮横地说我们的报告是“非科学的”以及/或只不过是“观点”。同时，四位评议者自己没有提供任何有效的科学论证，相反只有等同于观点的无根据的宣称。有趣的是，四位评议者的评议都犯有相同的错误。这个模式是可疑的，并且应该被调查。

与此模式一致，如下文所证，第四位评议者的几项评议几乎与第三位雷同。这是对同行评议规则地粗暴违反，即每位评议者应提供他/她对作品无偏见的、独立的评价分析。

这位评议者还表示，我们不会提供更多实锤数据。但很清楚，他已被我们2020年10月8日的第二篇报告证明是错误的。那篇报告仅仅在他们的评议发布的14天之后发表，而在我们第一篇报告发布的24天之后。


> She modulates her description of the RaTG13 sequence from “widely questioned” moves to “spurious” moves to “likely fraudulent.” The old camel nose/tent trick. See the following.
> 
> *“However, the existence of RaTG13 in nature and the truthfulness of its reported sequence are being widely questioned6-9,19-21.*“
> 
> *“A follow-up report, which summarizes the up-to-date evidence proving the spurious nature of RaTG13, will be submitted soon.*“
> 
> *“What is not thoroughly described in this report is the various evidence indicating that several coronaviruses recently published (RaTG1318, RmYN0230, and several pangolin coronaviruses27-29,31) are highly suspicious and likely fraudulent.*“
> 
> She requires certain viral sequences (including RaTG13 and the pangolin viruses) that are closely related to SARS-CoV2 to be fraudulent, as it allows her to claim that her candidate virus, ZC45, is the closest relative to SARS-CoV2. Why is this her candidate? The reason is probably its connection with the military, see below). RaTG13 is 97% identical at the nucleotide level, ZC45 only 89%. At least one of the sources she quotes for the pangolin sequence being fraudulent does not, in fact, make that claim. It merely says that the pangolins may have gotten the virus from a different species. And even if they were fraudulent, it still would require more than 3,000 nucleotide substitutions to become SARS-CoV2. This is not even slightly credible; it beggars reason.
> 
> *“Genomic sequence analysis reveals that ZC45, or a closely related bat coronavirus, should be the backbone used for the creation of SARS-CoV-2.*“
> 
> *“The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is suspiciously similar to that of a bat coronavirus discovered by military laboratories in the Third Military Medical University (Chongqing, China) and the Research Institute for Medicine of Nanjing Command (Nanjing, China) (i.e, ZC45).*“


【评议者】

她把对RaTG13序列的说法从“广受质疑”调整到了“欺骗性的”以及“应该是伪造的”。真是帐篷里的骆驼（俚语，得寸进尺的意思）。如下：

*“怎么说，RaTG13在自然界的存在以及其被报告的基因序列的真实性受到了广泛的质疑。”*

*“不久，下一篇报告将提供最新数据证明RaTG13的欺骗性本质。”*

*“这篇报告没有彻底叙述的是，最近发布的几个冠状病毒显示，（RaTG13……）是高度可疑、几近伪造的各种证据。”*

她要求把（RaTG13……）这些与新冠紧密联系的病毒序列判为伪造，以容许她宣布她的候选病毒ZC45，并称其是与新冠最接近的。为什么是这个候选者？原因也许是其与军方的联系。

要知道，RaTG13在核苷酸水平上与新冠有97%一致性，ZC45是89%。关于穿山甲序列的伪造性，她引述的资源中至少有一项不支持这一声明。资料只表示，穿山甲也许从别的物种那里获得了病毒。而且即使它们是伪造的，它（ZC45）仍需经超过3000个核苷酸改造以变成新冠。这一理论甚至连很少的可信度都没有，需要理由。（其余略）


> Response: We have published our second report which proved the fraudulent nature of these novel animal coronaviruses: RaTG13, RmYN02, and a series of pangolin coronaviruses. We assume that the reviewer had been misled by these fabricated viruses in making this comment here.
> 
> However, if the reviewer truly believes that these coronaviruses are not fabricated, he could only argue so scientifically — he would have to use in-depth analyses and valid supporting literature to prove his point, similar to what we have done in our second report. Unsupported claims like what this reviewer is making here carry no weight.
> 
> In regard to the over 3,000 nucleotides difference between ZC45 and SARS-CoV-2, we have provided detailed explanations in our response to review 1.


【闫博士】回应：

我们已经发表了第二篇报告，当中揭示了这些新动物冠状病毒的伪造本质，包括RaTG13、RmYN02，以及一系列穿山甲冠状病毒。我们姑且假定，评议者是被这些伪造病毒误导而做出这一评议的。

不管怎么说，如果评议者真地相信这些冠状病毒不是伪造的，他只能科学地用分析深入且合理的文献来证明他的论点，就像我们在第二篇报告中所做的那样。像评议者此处这样无根据的声明，不值一提。至于新冠和ZC45之间那3000个核苷酸的差异，我们已经在回应第一个评议者时详细解释过了。


> Then she presents a scheme for converting ZC45 to SARS2. Totally unnecessary, all you would have to do is synthesize your desired genome, transfect the DNA into a host cell, and out pops your virus. The larger question is, how would you know what exact genome would have all the characteristics you wanted?


【评议者】

然后她提出一个转ZC45为新冠的时间表。这毫无必要，所有你需要做的就是合成你设计的基因，用DNA感染一个宿主细胞，产生出你的病毒。更大的问题是，你怎么能知道什么样的基因组能有你需要的所有属性？


> Response: This is essentially the same argument made by reviewer 3. Not only both reviewers argued that designed genome and DNA synthesis would be the go-to approach, but also they both immediately disproved their own proposal.
> 
> As we have explained previously in responding to review 3, it is simply ridiculous to propose that a novel coronavirus, which is optimal in infecting humans and can cause a pandemic, can be produced only through computer design and DNA synthesis. Unless the two reviewers had the same brain or one had copied the idea from the other, it is impossible for them to have been so synchronized: making the identical, scientifically absurd proposal and then dismissing it immediately afterward.


【闫博士】回应：

回应：这实际上重复了第三位评议者的论点。他们不仅都争辩说，设计好的基因组和DNA合成能行得通，但又都同时打脸自己的主张。

如我们之前给第三位评议者的回应中所解释的，认为能仅仅靠电脑设计和基因合成来制造一个新的冠状病毒，且能极佳地感染人类并引起大流行，是荒唐可笑的。除非两位评议者有相同的头脑或是相互拷贝了对方的想法，否则他们不可能这么同步：提出理想化但科学上荒唐可笑的主张，然后又马上自扇耳光。

【笔者浅释】如前所释，你可以用DNA合成出一团肉，但一团肉和一条虫完全是两个概念——一个是尸体，一个是生命。创造一种新的活病毒且具备你所希望的那些功能，哪有那么容易。再说，如果这么容易就能做出活的病毒，那当然就能预先知道它将会具有哪些功能了，这有什么好奇怪的呢？一方面说合成活病毒很容易，一方面又说无法预知其功能，这不是自相矛盾吗？


> Her second point is that the RBD is “suspiciously” close to that of SARS1. No, it’s not. The pangolin sequences are 100% in the RBD. Can’t get much closer than that. That’s why she has to claim the pangolin sequences are fraudulent.


【译评者】

她第二个论点是，RBD与SARS1可疑地高度一致。但并不是这样。穿山甲的序列在RBD上与RBD100%一致，不可能更接近了。这就是为什么她不得不宣称，穿山甲的序列是伪造的。


> Response: This is also essentially the same mistaken comment made by reviewer 3, which we have responded to earlier.


【闫博士】回应：

他和第三位评议者犯的错误一样，我们已经回应过了。


> Point 3 is the furin cleavage site. She states that this doesn’t occur in “other viruses of this class.” Not clear what she means by class. Presumably, she means SARS-like CoVs. It’s certainly in some other coronaviruses. MERS has 2 of them. infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) Beaudette strain, a chicken coronavirus, has 2. People have presented a credible origin of the furin cleavage site by a simple copy-choice mistake by the viral polymerase.


【译评者】

第三点是弗林酶切位点。她说，这在其他此类病毒中不曾出见。不知道她说的“此类”是什么意思，也许她指的是SARS类冠状病毒。然而，在其他冠状病毒里确定是有（切位点）的。MERS有两个，IBV博德特菌株——一个禽类冠状病毒也有两个。已经有人提出了可靠的弗林酶切位点起源：一个简单的病毒酶样板选择错误。


> Response: This is again essentially the same comment made by reviewer 3. Reviewer 4 here even “cited” the same words – “other viruses of this class” – as reviewer 3 did. However, as we have responded earlier, these words are nowhere to be found in our report. This is iron proof that at least one of the two reviewers had committed plagiarism. We will not repeat our earlier response to this comment, except to point out that the reviewer ought to cite at least one reference to support his final claim. Without it, people have no way of judging how credible is the reviewer’s theory that the furin-cleavage site could originate from a simple copy-choice error by the viral polymerase. Importantly, has such a copy-choice error led to the occurrence of a functional furin-cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction in any naturally occurring lineage B β coronaviruses? Also, what could be the molecular basis for having tandem CGG rare codons introduced here in SARS-CoV-2 *spike*by simple copy-choice mistake by the viral polymerase? We have provided extensive and in-depth analyses in our report to prove the non-natural origin of this furin-cleavage site. Having no answers to our questions or showing no evidence when making unsupported claims like he did here dictates that the reviewer’s argument is of no value.


【闫博士】回应：

这又和第三位评议者的一样。第四位评议者甚至还引述了同样的话：“此类的其他病毒”，就像第三位那样。然而，正如我们已经回应过的，这些语句在我们的报告里根本找不到。这是铁的证据证明，两位评议者中至少有一位进行了剽窃。我们不想再重复之前的回应，除非评议者能至少提出一项引证来支持他最后的声明。没有的话，人们无从判断评议者提到的弗林酶切位点能来源于简单的样板选择错误理论是否可信。重要的是，可曾有这样的样板选择错误，导致在S1/S2联接点出现弗林酶切位点的这一现象，出现在任何一款自然界的B系β冠状病毒里？还有，新冠刺突里那一双罕见的CGG密码子有什么分子基础，能靠病毒聚合酶样板选择错误而产生？我们已经在报告里提供了广泛而深入的分析，证明此弗林酶切位点没有自然起源。在这里提出无根据的声明，却回答不出我们的问题或出示不了证据，说明评议者的论点毫无价值。


> Finally, her timing is odd. Why hasn’t she published before? What will she submit soon? Why not now? I doubt anything substantive is coming.


【评议者】

最后，她的时间点是奇怪的。为什么她不在这之前发表（报告）？她不久还要发表什么？为什么不是现在？我怀疑后续还会有什么。


> Response: This again is the same comment made by reviewer 3. We have commented on the “issue” of timing in our response to reviewer 3 and will not repeat it here again. In addition, contradictory to what this reviewer has predicted, we indeed have published a second report that substantiated our claim that certain coronaviruses have been fabricated to mislead the world on the origin of SARS-CoV-21. This reviewer has been proven wrong once again.
> 
> It is shameful and utterly irresponsible that one of the two reviewers repeatedly copied from the other in a published peer review. Where is independent, critical thinking? Is there any credibility in them giving advice to decision-makers on the issue of the COVID-19 pandemic?


【闫博士】回应：

这又和第三位评议者一样。我们已经回应过第三位这个关于时间点的问题，所以不想在此重复了。另外，与评议者预计的相反，我们确实发布了第二篇报告，补充了我们对一些冠状病毒是伪造用以误导世界对新冠起源调查的声明。评议者再次被证明是错误的。

两位评议者中的一位在发表同行评议时不断拷贝另一位，这是可耻和极其不负责任的。独立的思考在哪里？就新冠大流行事件，他们可有任何可信度来给政策决定者们提出建议？


> Her research appears to be funded by the Rule of Law Society and the Rule of Law Foundation. The sister nonprofit organizations are connected to Steve Bannon, a former chief strategist for the Trump administration, and Guo Wengui, a billionaire and political activist who fled China in 2014 in anticipation of corruption charges from the Communist Party. Neither organization has published scientific literature before, according to a Google Scholar search. A website linked to Bannon and Wengui has a history of making inaccurate claims about the coronavirus pandemic.


【评议者】

她的研究显然是基于法治基金和法制社会。这一双非盈利组织是和史蒂夫·班农——前川普政府首席策略官——相关联的，另外与之相关的还有2014年因贪腐指控从中（共）国逃亡的亿万富翁兼政治活动家郭文贵。根据谷歌搜索，这两家机构以前从未发表过科学论文。有一个与班农和郭文贵关联的网站曾就新冠大流行发表过不正确的声明。


> Response: This again is the same exact issue raised by reviewer 3 earlier, which we have responded to previously. Both reviewers crossed the line here as this issue has nothing to do with the science presented in our report. As peer reviewers, they are obligated to judge the article based on its scientific merits. The politicization by these reviewers on this topic is a shame.
> 
> Mr. Guo and Mr. Bannon did not know Dr. Yan until right before she escaped from Hong Kong at the end of April 2020. By then, Dr. Yan had been anonymously exposing various facts of the COVID-19 pandemic for over three months, and all the information she shared had been verified.
> 
> Mr. Guo started exposing the corruption and injustice of the CCP regime since 2017. His efforts have led to the awakening of many Chinese people and have encouraged them to pursue freedom, human rights, and equality. Because of these actions, Mr. Guo has been brutally attacked and defamed by the CCP regime. The *Rule of Law Foundation*and *Rule of Law Society*were founded by him, which played a pivotal role in assisting Dr. Yan’s escape from Hong Kong so that she could now tell the truth of COVID-19 to the world.
> 
> Finally, given the reviewer’s severe incompetency in understanding coronavirus biology as evidenced in his comments, it is clear that he has no authority in judging what are accurate claims or what are inaccurate claims about the coronavirus pandemic. He has proven himself simply not credible.


【闫博士】回应：

这又和第三位评议者提出的一样，我们已经回应过了。两位评议者在此越界提出的信息与我们报告中提供的科学资料没半毛钱关系。作为同行评议者，他们必须就作品的科学价值做出评判。这些评议者在这一主题上的政治化是可耻的。

郭先生和班农先生在闫博士2020年4月底逃离香港前，对她一无所知。此前三个多月，她是匿名揭露新冠大流行真相的，而所有她披露的信息都得到了证实。

郭先生从2017年就开始揭露中共的腐败和不公。他的努力已经导致了许多中国人的觉醒，并受到鼓励而追求自由、人权和平等。由于这些行动，郭先生一直遭到中共政权粗暴地攻击和诋毁。法制基金和法治社会是由他创立的，并在帮助闫博士逃离香港中起了关键作用，因此，她得以告诉世界新冠的真相。

最后，考虑到评议者在理解冠状病毒生物学上如他评议所证的无能，很明显，在判定关于新冠大流行的声明哪些是正确的、哪些是不正确的方面，他没有任何权威。他的自证自己毫无可信度。


> To more specifically review Yan’s publication, let’s look at her Abstract.
> 
> 1. She says the natural origin theory lacks substantial support. No, it doesn’t(*1-3*). This seems deliberately deceptive.
> 
> 2. She says papers claiming a man-made origin are strictly censored by peer-reviewed journals. As a sometimes peer reviewer, I don’t call peer-review censorship.
> 
> 3. She says the virus shows biological characteristics that are inconsistent with a naturally occurring, zoonotic virus. Dubious claim.
> 
> 4. She postulates a synthetic route that is partly doable but tedious, and is otherwise logically impossible.


【评议者】

为了更明确地回顾闫发表的作品，我们来看看她的摘要：

1. 她说自然起源理论缺乏实质性支持。不，不是这样（1-3）。这似乎是故意欺诈。
2. 她说宣扬人造理论的论文被同行评议杂志所严格审查。曾作为同行评议者的我并没有发现此类审查。
3. 她说病毒显示出生物学特征与自然起源的动物传染性病毒不符。这是可疑的声明。
4. 她假设了一种合成途径，那是部分可行但却冗长的，且其他部分逻辑上不可能。



> Response:
> 
> 1. Reference 1 listed by the reviewer was promoting the natural origin theory and yet the arguments within were founded upon RaTG13 and pangolin coronaviruses. With RaTG13 and pangolin coronaviruses proven fraudulent, this reference is now proven of no value. Reference 2 and 3 do not support the natural origin theory. Rather reference 3 proved that genetic engineering of the Spike could turn a bat coronavirus into a novel, artificial coronavirus that is capable of using human ACE2 for cell entry and infection. In fact, here, the reviewer used a reference that supports, not dismisses, our first report. This indicates that the reviewer is either unfamiliar with the relevant literature in coronavirus research or is careless in giving his reviewer’s comments.
> 
> 2. The censorship on the lab origin theories by journals has been documented in an article, which we have cited in our report (reference #22). Furthermore, email exchanges between signees of the *Lancet*statement, which were exposed by the *US Right to Know*, clearly indicated that the journal *Lancet*was promoting the natural origin theory without supporting evidence and at the same time called the lab origin claims “conspiracy theories” also without putting forward any evidence.
> 
> The reviewer argued that his own experiences do not suggest peer-review censorship. We would argue that his actions here indeed provided a fine example of peer review censorship on this sensitive topic. Having functioned in the role of a peer reviewer does not mean that one is a competent or qualified peer reviewer. This reviewer’s comments and behavior here showed convincingly that he is completely incompetent and unqualified as a reviewer. Yet, he was placed in the role of a “reviewer” regardless. If our report had to be approved by a peer reviewer like him to be published, then it simply would not get published despite that it is solid scientifically.
> 
> 3. Part 1 of our report, which is at least half of our overall content, was dedicated to supporting and proving just this claim. Compared to the substantial evidence and analyses we have provided in part I of our report, the two-word comment, “dubious claim,” of the reviewer weighs next to zero scientifically.
> 
> 4. Similarly, the reviewer came to his conclusion about our postulated synthetic route without providing any reasoning or literature support. While the route postulated by us is convenient, inexpensive, verifiable, involving established techniques and available materials, and still popular in top labs doing coronavirus research, the reviewer failed to propose anything realistic himself. His comment is, once again, invalid.


【闫博士】回应：

1、评议者列出的第一条参考资料是在鼓吹自然起源理论，但其内在论点都基于RaTG13和穿山甲冠状病毒。在RaTG13和穿山甲冠状病毒被证伪之后，这些参考资料现在已被证明是没有价值的。第二条和第三条参考资料并不支持自然起源理论，相反，第三条资料证明，刺突的基因工程能把蝙蝠冠状病毒变成新的人造冠状病毒，并能够利用人类受体进入人类细胞而感染人类。实际上，评议者在这里引用了支持而非反对我们第一篇报告的资料。这说明，评议者要么对冠状病毒研究的相关文献不熟悉，要么在做评议时太粗心了。

2、对于实验室起源理论的审查已经在一篇文章里被记载下来，我们也已在报告里引用了（引证22）。另外，被US RIGHT TO KNOW（我们有权知道）揭露的柳叶刀声明签名者的邮件往来清楚显示出，柳叶刀杂志在为没有支持性证据的自然起源理论打广告，同时，其毫无根据地把实验室起源论称为“阴谋论”。

评议者争辩说，他自己的经历中没有建议过同行评议做审查。我们情愿在此认为，他的行为实际上提供了一个完美的关于同行评议审查这一敏感话题的例证。占着同行评议的位置，并不意味着他就是有能力或有素养的。此评议者在此的评议和行为令人信服地显示出，他作为评议者之完全无能和缺乏素养。然而无视这一切，他却仍然占据着评议家的位置。如果我们的报告必须得到像他这种评议者的同意才能发表，那么就算它是实锤科学性的，也根本不会被发表。

3、我们报告的第一部分，至少是我们报告内容的一半，就我们的声明提供了支持和证明。与我们在报告的第一部分提供的充足的证据和分析相比，来自评议者的那两个词的评议——“可疑的声明”——其科学性几近于零。

4、同样的，评议者就我们假设的合成途径没有任何理由和文献支持就得出结论。我们假设的途径是便利的、经济的，包括了已有的技术和就手可得的材料，其在冠状病毒研究的顶级实验室仍然流行。与此同时，评议者自己没能提供任何现实可行的建议。他的评议再次无效。


> The **Introduction**
> 
> 1. She says it has characteristics that are incompatible with a zoonotic respiratory virus, including being highly transmissible and significantly lethal in high-risk populations. The Incas would be relieved to know that measles, derived from rinderpest in cattle, does not share those characteristics.
> 
> 2. She claims that the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein binds human ACE2 better than any other species. No, it doesn’t; it binds various ACE2 receptors from other species as well, including pikas and rabbits (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.25817). Her citation is a non-peer-reviewed in silico modeling study.
> 
> 3. She accuses the reports of the sequence of one of the purported precursors to SARS2, RaTG13, as being probably fraudulent. The references she gives are either weak or don’t claim this at all. In fact, one of the notes that six workers in a cave from which a closely related sample was obtained from bat feces suffered from atypical viral pneumonia, and three of them died in 2013 (https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202005.0322/v2). This would rather seem to point to the reality of RaTG13.


【评议者】

前言

1、她说新冠有不符合动物传染性呼吸道病毒的特征，包括在高危人群中的高传染率和显著的致命性。Incas应该感到欣慰地得知，来自于牛瘟的麻疹，也具有这些特征。

2、她宣称刺突的受体绑定域结合人类受体的能力优于绑定任何其他物种。不，不是这样。它也能绑定其他物种，包括鼠兔和兔子。

3、她控告新冠的可能的前身，RaTG13的序列报告可能是伪造的。她给出的参考资料不是太弱，就是根本就没有这样的声明。事实上，其中一份报告说明，2013年在一个矿洞的六名工人感染了典型的病毒性肺炎，其中三人死亡。而在蝙蝠粪便里找到了高度关联的病毒。


> Response:
> 
> 1. Our exact description was “*(a)s a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 differs significantly from other respiratory and/or zoonotic viruses: it attacks multiple organs; it is capable of undergoing a long period of asymptomatic infection; it is highly transmissible and significantly lethal in high-risk populations; it is well-adapted to humans since the very start of its emergence1; it is highly efficient in binding the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2), the affinity of which is greater than that associated with the ACE2 of any other potential host*.” Apparently, we did not suggest that any single feature listed is unique for SARS-CoV-2. Instead, we meant that these features collectively make SARS-CoV-2 unique among respiratory and/or zoonotic viruses. The reviewer manipulated our description and took things out of context in making his comment and criticism. Were measles well adapted to humans at the very beginning? Did the initial measles strain, which just crossed over into humans, bind human receptors optimally over the receptor of any other animal? Furthermore, our conclusion on the laboratory origin of SARS-CoV-2 was also based heavily on genetic evidence, such as the “smoking gun” that matches the cloning routine of Drs. Zhengli Shi and Fang Li, suggesting past genetic manipulation of the genome. Could the reviewer point to similar marks of genetic manipulation in measles to prove his point that all characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are precedented? Clearly, our original statement is accurate and appropriate. The reviewer’s counterargument here, however, is invalid.
> 
> 2. We had cited two publications when we made this point in our report. However, the reviewer picked only one and questioned the validity of this citation since it is an *in silico*study. The reviewer intentionally left the other citation out, which looked at the RBD-ACE2 binding using a robust biochemical assay. The results of both studies prove that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds human ACE2 the best. What ridicules the matter further was that the article that the reviewer used as a counterargument here is also an *in silico*study and did not even describe binding energies for the pairs of RBD-ACE2 that they modeled. This comment speaks in volumes of the reviewer’s incompetency as a peer reviewer and a scientist in general.
> 
> 3. The references we provided regarding RaTG13 were robust and consistent with our description. More importantly, we have published our second report, which has proved RaTG13 fraudulent. We also have offered our insights to reject the Mojiang Miner Passage hypothesis (section 1.6 of our second report). RaTG13 is a fabricated virus, not obtained from a cave or any other place in nature, and Mojiang cave is not the home of SARS-CoV-2.


【闫博士】回应：

1、我们的确切的叙述是：“新冠与其他呼吸道和/或动物传染性病毒有显著的不同：它攻击多个器官；它能够进行长时间的无症状感染；它在高危人群中具有高度的传染性及致命性；它自出现之初就对人类有良好的适应性；它与人类受体结合率很高，其亲和力大于与任何其他潜在宿主受体的亲和力。”显然，我们没有说上述任何一项单一的特征是新冠独有的，而是说这些特征综合起来，使新冠在呼吸道和/或动物传染性病毒中十分独特。评议者歪曲我们的叙述，并从上下文中抽取一部分出来做出评议和批评。

难道麻疹一开始就能很好地适应人类吗？难道最初的麻疹种类，即刚刚跨种传入人群的那种，绑定人类受体优于其他动物受体吗？另外，我们的新冠实验室起源结论还极大地基于基因证据，比如与石正丽博士和李放博士的克隆记录相吻合的确凿证据，说明已经有过对基因组的基因改造。评议者能对麻疹也指出类似的这些基因改造以证明他的观点，即新冠的这些特征是有先例的吗？很清楚，我们的原始表述是准确的和适当的。评议者在这里的抗辩，无论如何都是无效的。

2、我们在报告里已经引证了两份发表物。然而，评议者只选了一份，然后质疑其品质，因为那是一份电脑模拟研究。评议者故意丢掉另一份引证资料，该资料以坚实的生化试验研究了绑定域和受体的绑定。两份研究的结果都证明，新冠绑定域绑定人类受体优于其他物种。更可笑的是，评议者在此用作抗辩的文章也是一份电脑模拟研究，而且其甚至都没有陈述它们模拟的绑定域和受体的绑定能量。这种评议响亮地说明，他作为评议者和科学家整体上的无能。

3、我们提供的有关RaTG13的参考资料是坚实且与我们的陈述相一致的。更重要的是，我们已经发表了第二篇报告，证明RaTG13是伪造的。我们也提供了深入调查，以排除云南墨江矿工的报道（第二篇报告的1.6）的假说。RaTG13是伪造的病毒，无法从矿洞或自然界的任何地方获取，墨江的矿洞也不是新冠的老巢。

【笔者浅释】电脑模拟研究大家其实并不陌生。大家一定在电视或电影里已经无数次看到过模拟水滴到地面飞溅起来，或者爆炸时火舌喷发、墙倒屋塌这类高科技画面，这几乎已经成了所有大片的标配。不仅如此，连著名的阿尔法狗电脑围棋程序战胜人类世界冠军，其实也是电脑模拟研究的一种。只要各种参数设置正确、齐全，电脑模拟的结果即使不是100%正确，也具有很高的可信度和真实性。因此、现在可以说全世界几乎所有科学领域的专家，都在很大程度上依赖这种方式（省时省力省钱）。在展开精确的正式研究（费时费力费钱）前，其有极高的参考和指导价值。当然，前提是参数设置必须正确、齐全。如上述，连“绑定域和受体的绑定能量”都没有说明的模拟研究，就有点问题了。


> **The Proposed Construction**
> 
> It is necessary for her to claim that a number of sequences (including RaTG13, 97% identical by nucleotide sequence) are fraudulent because its absence allows her to use ZC45 (89% identical by nucleotide sequence). She probably chose this because she could link it to the military. Here’s what she suggests. She says you start with ZC45 as a precursor. At 89% identity, you would need about 3,300 nucleotide changes. You engineer in an ACE2 receptor binding domain and furin cleavage sites. OK, although that ACE2 binding site is not optimal for ACE2 binding. Then you engineer in a pol gene that responds well to remdesivir (because this gives you a good antiviral and would make remdesivir profitable). Then you adapt the virus by a passage in culture for the ability to better infect human cells. This step, however, is simply beyond belief. You would need more than 3,000 individual mutations. This probably represents hundreds of millennia of evolution. It’s even more incredible because coronaviruses have RNA proofreading enzymes that make them fairly stable genetically, although they do readily undergo recombination by RNA polymerase template slippage or switching.

关于假设的新冠构建：

她需要声明一些序列（包括97%相似度的RaTG13）是伪造的，因为其被排除能让她使用ZC45（核苷酸89%相似度）。也许她选它是因为ZC45能够联系到军方——那就是她的暗示。她说ZC45才是（新冠）前身。然而，以89%的水平，你需要改变约3000个核苷酸。她说他们加工了受体绑定域，还加了弗林酶切位点。也行，尽管那个绑定域对受体并非最佳。然后，他们又加工了逆转录酶基因，那个能很好地响应瑞德西韦（由此就给了他们一个很好的抗病毒剂而让瑞德西韦赚钱）。然后，他们又用连续传代来调教病毒，令其能更好地感染人类细胞。这个步骤怎么说都不可信。你将需要修改超过3000个核苷酸，这表示可能要十万年的演变。更不可信的是，因为冠状病毒有RNA校正酶，那能让它们令基因相当稳定，尽管它们确实会接受RNA聚合酶模板滑动或转换带来的重组。


> Response: The reviewer is completely mistaken here.
> 
> First, these mentioned coronaviruses, RaTG13, a series of pangolin coronaviruses, RmYN02, are indeed fraudulent. We have provided substantial evidence in our second report in proving so. If the reviewer disagrees with our second report, he needs to come up with robust, evidence-based scientific arguments, not empty comments, to contest our analyses and conclusions.
> 
> Second, we have provided evidence on why ZC45/ZXC21 must be the template/backbone used for the creation of SARS-CoV-2, part of which is the 100% sequence identity on the E protein between SARS-CoV-2 and ZC45/ZXC21. Before the publication of RaTG13, ZC45 and ZXC21 were the closest match genetically to SARS-CoV-2, which we have elaborated in our response to review 1.
> 
> Third, the reviewer is also awfully mistaken in stating that SARS-CoV-2 Spike is not optimized for binding human ACE2. The literature evidence all speaks overwhelmingly against his statement – it has been shown repeatedly and consistently that SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds the human ACE2 better than to ACE2 of any other animal. The reviewer’s lack of knowledge on this subject proves once again that he is severely and dangerously underqualified as a peer reviewer here.


【闫博士】回应：

评议者在这个地方彻底弄错了。

首先，这些冠状病毒（RaTG13，一系列穿山甲冠状病毒，RmYN20）的的确确是伪造的，我们已经在第二篇报告中提供了充分的证据加以证明。如果评议者不同意，他需要提供坚实的、基于证据的科学论点，而不是通过空洞的评议来和我们的分析和结论较量。

第二，我们已经提供证据证明，为什么ZC45/ZXC21一定被用作为制造新冠的模板/骨架。部分原因是，它们和新冠的E蛋白序列上100%一致。在RaTG13发表之前，ZC45/ZXC21是和新冠基因最匹配的，这点我们已经在给第一位评议者的回应中详细叙述过了。

第三，评议者说新冠刺突在绑定人类受体方面不是最佳的，这是糟糕的错误。文献资料的陈述压倒性地与此相反——已经不断地且一致地被证明，新冠绑定域绑定人类受体优于绑定任何其他物种。评议者对此事的缺乏了解，再次证明他在此作为评议者是严重且危险地不合格。


> Fourth, we have never stated that the chosen RdRp would respond well to remdesivir. Instead, we listed two possible reasons why the CCP scientists would want to incorporate a particular RdRp gene into the artificial genome of SARS-CoV-2. One of the possible reasons was that they may see this particular RdRp more amenable toward antiviral drug discovery. This review comment, written by reviewer 3 or reviewer 4 and copied by the other, made it evident that these two reviewers were unable to read and understand a well-written scientific report. They, once again, failed to meet the standard of competent peer reviewers here.
> 
> Fifth, the reviewer was wrong in assuming that changes as many as 3,000 could not be introduced into the genome of a template coronavirus when artificially creating a novel coronavirus. We have explained this issue in our response to review 1 and will not repeat those details here again. However, one thing we do want to point out is that, as we have described both in the original report and in responding to review 1, most of these changes should have been introduced at steps prior to serial passage. Although the serial passage step may introduce some changes, it is not where the majority of nucleotide mutations were introduced. Therefore, the reviewer’s arguments that “*(t)his probably represents hundreds of millennia of evolution*” and “*coronaviruses have RNA proofreading enzymes that make them fairly stable genetically*” are simply irrelevant; they do not support his argument that significant changes could not be introduced. He again failed, shamefully, to understand our report.


【闫博士】继续回应：

第四，我们从未说过，经过挑选的RdRp会很好地响应瑞德西韦。相反，我们列举了两个理由说明，为什么中共科学家们想要在人造的新冠基因组里包含一个特定的RdRp基因。其中一个可能的理由是，他们也许看到了这个RdRp比较能胜任抗病毒药物的开发。这个评议，由第三位或第四位评议者写下而被另一位拷贝，证明了两位评议者缺乏阅读和理解著作优良的科学报告的能力，他们在此再一次未达到合格的有能力的评议者的标准。

第五，评议者假定，制造新冠状病毒时3000个核苷酸的改变不可能被引入一个冠状病毒模板的基因组，这是错误的。我们已经在给第一位评议者的回应中解释过了，这里就不再详细重复。不管怎么说，有一件事我们想要指出，就是如我们已经在之前的报告和给评议者1的回应中说的，这些变化大部分理应是在连续传代之前的步骤里引入的。尽管连续传代也会引入一些改变，但那并非是大部分核苷酸遭到改造的地方。所以，评议者争辩说“可能要十万年的演变”和“冠状病毒有RNA校正酶，那能让它们令基因相当稳定”是文不对题的。这并不支持他的论点，即重要的变化不可能在此被引入。他再次可耻地未能理解我们的报告。

【笔者浅释】如前释，闫博士第一篇报告说过了，新冠基因改造主要是通过限制性酶切位点和弗林酶切位点来修改刺突基因，以及通过综合使用逆转录增殖技术修改Orf1b这两条线路，其会合后整体组装，再通过连续传代而完成的。整体组装后连续传代可以调教病毒，并对其做旧以隐藏改造痕迹，只有少量随机的变异是在连续传代这个步骤发生的。评议者说，“然后他们又用连续传代来调教病毒，令其能更好地感染人类细胞。这个步骤怎么说都不可信。你将需要修改超过3000个核苷酸，这表示可能要十万年的演变。”这段话表示，他认为3000个核苷酸的改变是在连续传代步骤完成的，所以要“十万年”。这说明，他错误理解了闫博士报告。


> My opinion is that this is an inept attempt to make the case the virus was man-made. There are no concrete facts in this report. I do wonder why this is coming out now. She implies she will be coming out with something more convincing in the future, but I’m willing to bet that if anything comes it will just be more of the same.


【评议者】

我的意见是，试图解释新冠是人造的这一理论是笨拙的。报告中没有铁的事实。我真的好奇，为什么它在此时发表。她暗示她不久后会提供更多证据，但是我打赌不会再有什么新鲜东西出现了。


> Response: Unfortunately, most of Dr. Reitz’s comments are completely incorrect and the rest of them are opinions that lack scientific support entirely. The only thing he succeeded here was to prove to the world that he is not credible as a reviewer, which dictates that his conclusion about our report is of no value.
> 
> If Dr. Reitz or any of the other reviewers truly believe their argument that SARS-CoV-2 must have come from nature, we suggest that they, working either individually or together, write formal, evidence-based article(s) to support this view of theirs. We would consider commenting on it, although, judging from the quality of their “review” comments here, we are very much convinced that their article(s) on this topic would be of very low quality scientifically.


【闫博士】回应：

很不幸，赖茨博士的大部分评议完全错误，而其余的观点也完全缺乏科学支持。他唯一成功的就是，向全世界证明他不是一个可信的评议者。这说明，他对我们报告的结论毫无价值。

如果赖茨博士或其他任何评议者真的相信他们的论点，即新冠一定是来自自然界，我们建议他们——各自或合作工作——写份正式的、基于证据的文章来支持他们的观点。我们会考虑对它做出评议。虽然，根据他们这份评议的品质来看，我们很肯定，他们就此一主题的文章的科学品质将是低下的。

（第一部分，对MIT Press组的评议的回应完毕）
