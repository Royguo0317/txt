1216早间要闻-NewYork Time

**LuDe Media 20201216 Morning News, New York Time**

**特别检察官人选已经确定**

**Special Prosecutor Selected**

路德透露，该检察官曾与林伍德律师共事，服务于布什家族，是为灭共而来的律师。川普总统没有答应麦康纳尔赦免乔拜登的请求，并且任命了特别检察官彻底调查亨特拜登事件。

LuDe revealed that the prosecutor had worked with attorney Lin Wood, served the Bush family and was a lawyer who came for the extermination of the CCP. Because President Trump did not grant McConnell’s request to pardon Joe Biden, and appointed a special prosecutor to thoroughly investigate the Hunter Biden affair.

**白宫律师办公室建议川普总统不要Fire掉FBI局长**

**White House Counsel’s Office Advised President Trump Not to Fire FBI Director**

国会山报报道的上述消息，一方面印证了川普总统即将解除Ray的FBI局长职务，另一方面也是在威胁川普总统，称如果Fire掉Ray的话，会被认视为报复行为，欲劝阻川普收回决定。

The Capitol Hill newspaper reported the above news, on the one hand, confirms that President Trump is about to dismiss the FBI director, Ray, on the other hand, is also threatening President Trump, saying that if fire off Ray, it will be recognized as an act of retaliation, trying to dissuade Trump from retracting his decision.

**美国防部突然关闭秘密互联网协议路由器**

**U.S. Defense Department Abruptly Shut Down Secret Internet Protocol Routers**

这是美国务院和国防部发送机密信息的一种路由器网络协议SIPRNet，疑已被（中共）攻击和解密。此次被关闭是为了进行升级，以全面提升保密性和安全性，避免再被攻击和解密，为日后的重大行动做好准备。

This is a network protocol of routers, SIPRNet, used by the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Defense to send classified information that is suspected to have been attacked and decrypted (by the CCP). It was shut down for an upgrade to fully enhance confidentiality and security to avoid further attacks and decryption, and to prepare for future major operations.

**美国联邦贸易委员会FTC14日宣布调查推特、脸书等九家大公司**

**FTC Announced Dec. 14 to Investigate Nine Major Companies, Including Twitter and Facebook**

被调查的公司还有Whatsapp、Youtube、字节跳动、Amazon、Reddit、Snap和Discord。调查内容包括，在收集与使用用户隐私数据上是否存在违规行为，如何确定向用户展示广告内容的方式，是否对个人信息使用算法或数据分析，数据政策对儿童和青少年的影响。此项调查的回复时限是45天。该调查将为未来的执法提供确凿依据。但路德分析这些公司早就有应对之策，比如提供海量的信息，让FTC无法在大海中找出证据，不了了之。

Other companies surveyed include WhatsApp, YouTube, ByteDance, Amazon, Reddit, SnapChat and Discord. The survey covers whether there are violations in the collection and use of users’ private data, as well as the way users display advertising contents, whether algorithms or data analytics are used on personal information, and the impact of data policies on children and adolescents. The survey, which has a 45-day response time, will provide a conclusive basis for future enforcement. However, LuDe analyzed these companies have long had a response strategy, such as providing massive amounts of information, so that the FTC cannot find evidences in the data-sea, and have to stop.

**我们每个人都处在超限战中**

**Each of Us in Wars Beyond Limits**

无论郭先生直播和路德社直播中有多少虚虚实实的战略战术，每一个战友都必须抱有必胜的信念，我们一直在创造历史、改变历史，战友们的群体潜意识是站在正义一边，胜利必然属于我们。

同时要清醒认识到，这个过程必然是艰辛的。如果中共那么容易就被干掉，爆料革命哪里还有价值？正因为来之不易，我们战友和体制内的精英们才会倍加珍惜，今后把自己国家建设得更好。

如果拜登主动退出，川普轻松取胜，放过了沼泽地内暗藏的鳄鱼，反而后患无穷。如果没有中共对美国的全面渗透及必然导致的操纵美国大选的滑稽场面，新中国联邦哪里有在美国存在的价值？郭先生又怎么会提前三年爆料中共蓝金黄？

No matter real or false strategies and tactics in live broadcasting of Mr. Guo and Mr. LuDe, every warrior must keep the belief that we will win. We have been making history and changing history. Our group subconscious is on the justice side, and victory is bound to belong to us.

At the same time, it is important to realize that the process is bound to be arduous. If the Chinese Communist Party is so easily to be exterminated, where is the value of Whistleblower Movement? It is because victory is not easy that we battle companions and the elites in the institutions will cherish it, and will build our country better in the future.

If Biden withdraw voluntarily, Trump will win easily, sparing the crocodiles hidden within the swamp, then the consequences would be endless. Without the CCP’s full infiltration into the U.S. and the inevitable comical spectacles of rigged elections, where is the value of the New Federal State of China in the United States? How did Mr. Guo come out three years early to break the news about the Chinese Communist Party’s blue and gold yellow? And why did Mr. Guo reveal the CCP’s Blue-Gold-Yellow plan three years in advance?
