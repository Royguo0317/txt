英文標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep221:  The Communist China government, after practicing genocide in Xinjiang, is now pursuing a policy of cultural genocide in Inner Mongolia

内容简介

1. 某學校匿名老師：“蒙古語是我們日常交流和生存的語言的一種，所以我們對母語的感情十分的深厚，所以作為蒙古族想要保護自己的母語，就這麼簡單。”
2. 恩和巴圖，南蒙古人權信息中心主任：“這是一個文化種族滅絕政策，這不是光是語言的問題，現在蒙古人的傳統文化已經基本上被中國政府扼殺掉了。現在剩下的就是語言。如果把這個語言扼殺掉了，基本上就沒有蒙古人的（身份特性）。所以我們就強烈譴責中國政府實行這種文化滅絕政策。”
3. 中共政府在繼新疆實行種族滅絕之後，又要在內蒙古實行文化滅絕政策。引發大規模警民對峙。
4. 2020年8月底，山西平遙古城私人臨街商舖已有210多戶祖產一夜之間收歸國有，30多家祖產被封被鎖，當地政府強制執行。私人房子被貼了封條，封條上寫著“平遙縣人民政府”。
5. （8/31）中國十億人沒有公共廁所。到現在中國竟然教育還不免費。連非洲很多國家，它支持的非洲，都已經免費了。黑幫主義。 向非洲一帶一路放出了所謂的上萬億的支持，萬億美元，十來萬億人民幣的支持。 中國現在有人吃不上飯。


1. Anonymous school teacher stated “Mongolian is the languages we use to communicate and survive on a daily basis, so we have a very strong attachment to our native language, thus it’s as simple as that as Mongolians want to protect our native language.”
2. Enghebatu, Director of Southern Mongolia Human Rights Information Centre stated”This is a policy of cultural genocide, it is not just a matter of language, now the traditional Mongolian culture has been basically killed by the Chinese government. What is left now is the language. If this language is strangled, there will be no Mongolian (identity). That’s why we strongly condemn the Chinese government for this cultural extermination policy.”
3. The Communist China government, after practicing genocide in Xinjiang, is now pursuing a policy of cultural genocide in Inner Mongolia. It has triggered a massive police standoff and armored military vehicles have been seen on street.
4. By the end of August 2020, more than 210 private street-level shops in Pingyao Ancient City, Shanxi Province, have been nationalized overnight, and more than 30 ancestral properties have been sealed and locked, enforced by the local CCP government. Private houses were plastered with seals that read ‘People’s Government of Pingyao County’.
5. (8/31 Miles Guo) One billion people still have no access to public toilets. Education in Communist China is not for free even until now. Even some African countries the CCP has been aiding already have free education. The CCP sent Africa up to one trillion dollars aid through the Belt and Road Initiative. Over 10 trillion RMB equivalent. Yet right now in China there’re people are still starving.
