新闻简述：在2021年2月8日的盖特视频中，郭先生说近日比特币的巨大涨幅是共产党搞货币绝对中心化带来的恐惧的结果。这种恐惧还带来了欧洲的古董、日本的古董、日本和欧洲房产的大热和中国精英的加速流失，最后加速共产党的灭亡。

**共产党货币绝对中心化造成共产党内部经济的绝对恐惧**

**The Consequence of the Centralization of Currency by the CCP**

从昨天到现在，华盛顿的咱们的战友们，说现在中南坑习下了命令，必须要在中国春节这个契机，牢牢地把握这个契机，让中美关系恢复正常化，让拜登要恭喜春节。看来三个硬盘发酵了，三个硬盘。所以说兄弟姐妹们，所谓美中春节外交即将开始，咱们拭目以待吧。

From yesterday till now, our fellow fighters in Washington D.C. have said that Xi [Jinping] in the Zhongnan Pit had given an order that they must firmly grasp this opportunity during the Chinese New Year to restore and normalize the Sino-US relation, and also make Biden greet Xi a happy new year. It seems that the “three hard drives” have worked, the three hard drives. So brothers and sisters-in-arms, the so-called Spring Festival diplomacy between the U.S. and China is about to begin, so let’s wait and see.

另外一个，这两天来看到比特币，涨、下、涨。大家要意识到，这是文贵两、三天前说的，这是共产党的所有的虚拟货币、共产党货币，让全世界的货币去中心化和其它的虚拟货币去中心化，他绝对中心化，造成的共产党内部经济的绝对恐惧。千万别忘了共产党内部的共产党员的钱不都是黑钱，也不都是赃钱，有些很多也是劳动获得的。但是共产党，在它的面前，一切都是党的，一切都听党的，你所有的钱都不合法，最大的受威胁的是共产党党员。所以这些财富的恐惧，一定想尽一切办法外移。

Also, the price of Bitcoin has been fluctuating greatly the last couple of days. People should realize that this is what Miles said two or three days ago: this is due to the extreme panic about the CCP’s domestic economy caused by the CCP’s centralization of its virtual currencies while asking the rest of the world to decentralize their currencies. Make no mistake, not all of the money of the CCP members’ is dirty money or corrupt money. There is money which is legal income from their work. But the CCP believes that everything belongs to the Party, everything must be at the Party’s will, and all your money is illegal, so the CCP members are facing the biggest threat. Therefore, this panic will inevitably cause them to transfer their wealth overseas by any means possible.

这就是所说的“外溢效应”，叫“突然的外力的效应”，就是个马桶在经济学说里面，一个水桶水，这里突然一个大石头扔进来了，它把水不仅仅是给你漾出来了，它就给你砸出来了。这个时候由于“恐惧”，突然间的外力，把水外溢以后，这水去哪里你无法控制。那么这就是非正常现象。

This is called the “spillover effect” or the “sudden external force effect”. In the economics theory, that means when a big rock is suddenly thrown into a toilet full of water, the water will splash out rather than flow out. When there is panic or sudden external force, you will not be able to control where the water [or money] will go to. This is a phenomenon not under normal conditions.

这就是看到为什么我说的，欧洲的古董、日本的古董、日本在一些好的地方的房地产[大卖]。日本的经济会崩溃的，在奥运前后，日本的整个的QE太夸张了，而且日本的QE全到国外去了，日本的地产一定会崩盘的，就这，大量的钱进去买。原来是买香港，现在是买欧洲。像伦敦的是房子就卖，伦敦的经济未来也好不了。为什么？就是中共所有的绝对中心化，共产党内部人知道，所以说他先赶快把钱给弄出去。这种外溢效应对共产党的经济是灾难的结果，他本来已经不堪一击了，靠擀面杖子经济完全虚假经济，这时候把所有的绝大多数人，中国的财富70%到80%在共产党员手里边哪，这财富外溢。

That’s why I said that the European antiques, the Japanese antiques, and some Japanese real estate in good locations [are in high demand]. Actually, the Japanese economy is collapsing around the time of the Olympics, and Japan’s quantitative easing (QE) is crazy, with the QE money all being invested abroad, so Japan’s real estate is bound to collapse in the future. That being said, a huge amount of money [from the CCP] is pouring in [the Japanese real estate]. Previously, people bought properties in Hong Kong, now people buy properties in Europe. London’s economy will not be good in the future, but its housing market is hot. Why? It is caused by the CCP’s absolute centralization [of its currency]. The insiders in the CCP have known this, so they are moving their money overseas as quickly as they can. This “spillover effect” will lead to catastrophic results to the CCP’s economy. It is already on the edge of collapsing and is a completely fake economy only supported by fake data. And at this point, the vast majority of China’s wealth, 70 to 80% of which is in the hands of CCP members, is spilling out.

而且这就是世界上虚拟货币、数字货币，未来两种货币。绝对去中心化的商业虚拟货币，和绝对中心化的国家为背书的基础性货币，这两个的对垒已经开始了。最终一定是去中心化货币赢，因为它安全、隐私，而且谁也控制不了。共产党绝对是打开了金融界的潘朵拉盒子。

Moreover, virtual currency and digital currency are the two forms of future currencies. The competition has begun between the absolutely decentralized commercial, virtual currency and the absolutely centralized state-endorsed currency. Ultimately, the decentralized currency will win because of its security, privacy, and the fact that it cannot be manipulated by anyone. The CCP has definitely opened the Pandora’s Box of the financial world.

那么大家能看到这些古董和在房地产市场的高昂，被共产党买走的时候，大家还有什么现象知道吗？这些人买完房子，买完古董，就要把更多的家人送到海外来。这在中国叫什么？它不仅是去中心化，是去精英化。而且是拔根儿，去几代。

Do you guys know what else will happen after you see the rising prices in the antique and real estate markets? After they finish buying houses and antiques, they will send more family members overseas! What is this called in China? Not only decentralization, but also the escape of the elites. It is the uprooting of multiple generations of elites.

那么现在看来，全世界在过去的几天里面，全人类都在想的是病毒的问题，都在找病毒的真正的来源。现在大家基本上都明白了，病毒就是共产党的武器。华盛顿今天2月8号以后，美国的真正的内部政治斗争，甚至引发内战是从今天开始，大家拭目以待吧。

Well, it seems that over the past few days, all humanity in this world are thinking about the virus problem and looking for its real source. Now everyone has known that the virus is the CCP’s weapon. Starting from today, February 8th, in Washington, D.C., a real political battle within America will begin, which might even lead to a civil war, so let’s wait and see.

全球联合灭共，全球没有选择地一起灭共，和共产党内部要想保存自己的财富，咱先说你合法财富和子孙的未来，你已经没有任何选择了。共产党要把你们这所有人都给中心化的结果，那不是老百姓害怕，是你们害怕，是你们的子子孙孙都要脱离不了魔鬼的共产党的机器，你愿意吗？

The world has no choice but to unite and take down the CCP, and those in the Communist Party who hope to protect their wealth – let’s first talk about their legal wealth and the future of their offsprings – will have no other choice. The consequence of the CCP centralizing all of you is not the panic of the common people. Rather, you [the CCP members] are panicked. Your offspring will never escape the evil CCP’s machine, are you willing to accept that?

所以说现在病毒经济、疫苗经济，现在是数字化人民币和蓝金黄直接威胁全世界的大统领。你就觉得它能赢吗？我绝对不相信。还更重要的，病毒的源头一定会很快找来。大家全向共产党找解药。你给不给解药？你不给解药的结果是什么？给了解药的结果是什么？共产党都没了，你的绝对中心化的货币还会存在吗？共产党都没了，你共产党员的财产还能安全吗？毫不夸张地说，只有新中国联邦才能代表中国人民，包括一些善良的还有希望拯救的共产党员的利益。只有新中国联邦，谁也不行，是吧？兄弟姐妹们，信不信？

Considering the current virus-based economy, the “vaccine economy”, and now the digital RMB and the “BGY” threatening all the world leaders, do you think the CCP will succeed? I absolutely do not believe it! And more importantly, the origin of the virus will definitely be found out soon. People will ask the CCP for the antidote. Will you [the CCP] give them the antidote? If you don’t give the antidote, what will be the consequence? If you do give the antidote, what will be the consequence? Once the CCP is gone, will the “absolutely centralized” currency still exist? Once the Communist Party is gone, will the assets of CCP members still be safe? It is no exaggeration to say that only the New Federal State of China can represent the interests of the Chinese people, including those good and redeemable members of the Communist Party! Only the New Federal State of China can do this. No one else, right? Brothers and sisters, do you believe it?

现在美国各派之间的较量你觉得会停止吗？你觉得各派之间的较量，所有能离开中共这个话题吗？各派之间的较量能不谈病毒吗？谈到病毒能不找病毒的真相吗？谈到病毒能不找我们的闫博士科学家吗？能不看路德访谈119吗？谁能跨过爆料革命、新中国联邦？

Do you think the current rivalry between the parties in the US will stop? Do you think the rivalry between the parties can avoid the topic of the CCP? Will they avoid talking about the virus? Will they only talk but not try to find the truth about the virus? Will they talk about the virus but not consult with our scientist, Dr. Yan? Is it possible for them not to watch the Jan. 19 episode of the Lude Show? Who can bypass the Whistleblower Movement and the New Federal State of China?

共产党你能把香港事件、缅甸事件、病毒真相能掩盖的了吗？只要知道你掩盖不了，你不能让75亿人闭嘴，你共产党就一定被灭。现在是绝对的国内所谓的用数字人民币、数字货币的统治世界的绝对中心化，事实上是去共化，事实上是将所有的中国的精英逼到外国，去精英化，所有的精英和撵出来的钱都到新中国联邦化，你不信走着看。

CCP, do you think you can cover up the truth about the Hong Kong crisis, the Myanmar coup, and the truth about the virus? As long as you fail to cover up the truth, fail to silence the 7.5 billion people, you, the CCP, will definitely be eliminated! The absolute centralization of digital RMB for controlling the world is essentially decommunization. In fact, it forces all the Chinese elites to flee to foreign countries. All the elites and the money will flow to the New Federal State of China. If you don’t believe me, you can wait and see.
