## IX. A State-By-State Analysis and Signal Failure of Our Legislative and Judicial Branches 

## IX. 一份对于我们立法和司法机构逐州的分析报告及其显著的不作为

All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

– Anna Karenina, by Leo Tolstoy

所有幸福的家庭都很相似；但是不幸的家庭各有各的不幸。

——《安娜**·**卡列尼娜》列夫**·**托尔斯泰著

It should be clear at this point that all six battleground states suffer from most or all of the six dimensions of election irregularities documented in this report. However, like Tolstoy’s unhappy families, it is also true that each battleground state is different in its own election irregularity way. That is, each battleground state may be characterized by a unique mix of issues that, impressionistically, might be considered “most important” in swinging that state for Joe Biden.

这六个战场州都经历了本报告中记录的大部分或全部六个选举违规行为，对于这一点已是非常清楚。然而，就像托尔斯泰所说“不幸的家庭各有不同”一样，每个战场州在其选举违规行为方式上也有所不同。也就是说,每个战场州的情况可以被描述成一系列独特的问题组合，从主观上来说，有可能这些问题能够成为将该州结果转向有利于乔·拜登的“最重要”因素。

Consider Arizona, a state with the lowest alleged Biden victory margin at 10,457 votes. This is a state with statistically improbable high voter turnouts in Maricopa and Pima counties; widespread ballot mishandling; and 1.6 million mail-in ballots (which tended towards Biden) subjected to much lower standards of certification and ID verification than in-person voters (who tended towards Trump).

以亚利桑那州为例，该州据称拜登以所谓最微弱的领先票数(获得10,457票)获胜。但是该州在马里科帕县和皮马县，投票率在统计学上不太可能很高；大范围选票处理不当；以及这160万邮寄选票(倾向于拜登)在认证和身份验证上的标准都要比亲自投票的选民的选票(倾向于川普)要低得多。

In Georgia, the alleged Biden victory margin was just 11,779 votes. What perhaps jumps out most in the Peach State is the illegal Consent Decree that effectively gutted the signature match requirements for millions of mail-in ballots. There is also the quite unresolved fake ballot manufacturing matter of the roughly 100,000 ballots that were mysteriously pulled, in the dead of night, out from underneath tables and expeditiously tabulated. Of course, we saw that Georgia’s electoral version of a Three-card Monte sleight-of-hand led to a strong Biden vote surge.

在佐治亚州，所谓拜登的领先票数仅为11,779票。对于发生在桃州的情况，可能最突出的就是非法同意令。该法令有效地规定了数百万张邮寄选票的签名匹配要求。还存在相当多不确定的假选票制造的问题，大约有100,000选票在深夜中神秘地从桌子底下抽出来,然后迅速纳入在计票表格里。当然，我们所看到的是佐治亚州选举版本的“三张牌把戏”(注：Three-card Monte是一种三张牌赌一张牌的游戏)，而这种花招导致了拜登选票强劲的飙升。

Of all of the six battleground states which suffered from numerous observer and poll watcher abuses, Michigan must rank as “first among equals.” With its “board up the windows” and “rough up the observers” tactics, Detroit in Wayne County was the center of this “see no evil” universe. When two local Republican officials tried to withhold certification of the votes in this county for practices such as these and demanded an audit, they were subject to extreme intimidation and “doxing” and quickly capitulated.143

在六个战场州都发生了对数名观察员和投票监督员不公的情形，而密歇根州在此方面应该是无人出其右。随着“挡住计票室的窗户”和“粗暴对待观察员”这些手段的曝光, 韦恩县的底特律成为了这个“看不见邪恶”的中心。当两名当地共和党官员试图因此类行为而拒绝认证该县的选票并要求进行审计时，他们受到了极端的恐吓和“被人肉搜索”，随后他们迅速认输，屈服。

As for Nevada, this is a state likewise with a very narrow alleged victory margin for Joe Biden – 33,596 votes. Here, voting machine irregularities associated with the Agilis machine have called into question as many as 130,000 votes. There may also be an unusually large number of ballots cast by out-of-state voters and others who did not meet residency requirements. Of course, the brazen bribery of Native Americans to vote for Joe Biden is a dark stain on the state and the Democrat Party.144

至于内华达州，同样是一个声称乔·拜登以微弱优势赢得该州(获得33,596票)。在这里，跟艾格里斯机器相关的投票机违规问题所涉及到的选票就达130,000张。非该州选民和其他不符合居住要求的人也有可能投出异常多的选票。当然，厚颜无耻地贿赂美国原住民投票给乔·拜登会成为该州和民主党的污点。

In Pennsylvania, an equally brazen Democrat Secretary of State issued illegal guidance for the acceptance of naked ballots and ignored direction from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to fix the matter. She allowed ballots to be illegally cured in contravention of state law and pushed the legal envelope for accepting ballots after Election Day.

在宾夕法尼亚州，一名同样厚颜无耻的民主党国务卿发布了关于接受无记名选票的非法指南，并且无视来自宾夕法尼州最高法院对此问题解决的指示。在公然违反州法律的情况下，她允许对选票进行非法补救纠正，并在选举日后推出接受选票的法律信封。

In the Keystone State, and as with Georgia’s Three-card Monte, shuffle fake ballots out from underneath a table scandal, there is also the equally unresolved matter of possible fake ballot manufacturing. Recall, here, the testimony of a truck driver who swears he picked up as many as 100,000 fake manufactured ballots in New York and delivered them to Pennsylvania. Both the tractor-trailer and the ballots involved remain unaccounted for – and what might have been in this tractor-trailer were enough ballots alone to swing the election to Joe Biden.

在拱心石州（宾夕法尼亚州），就像佐治亚州的“三张牌把戏”一样，从已是丑闻的“桌子”下抽出假选票，不仅如此,还有可能同样存在制造假选票的问题。 在这里回想一下，一位卡车司机的证词表示他在纽约得到多达10万张假选票，并把选票运送到了宾夕法尼亚州。拖拉机拖车和所涉及的选票仍然下落不明，而这辆拖拉机拖车中有足够多的选票有可能将选举结果转向乔·拜登。

Finally, in Wisconsin, the mother of all contestable process fouls is arguably that of the roughly 170,000 mail-in ballots entering the tabulation process under the guise of absentee ballots in clear violation of state law. That’s more than eight times the number of ballots of the alleged Biden victory margin of 20,682 votes.

最后，在威斯康辛州，所有有争议的过程违规的源头可以说是那大约17万张邮寄选票，在公然违反州法律的情况下以缺席选票的幌子进入制表流程。这个数字(17万)是所谓拜登获胜选票数目(20,682张)的8倍多。

In Wisconsin, there is likewise the large-scale abuse associated with an overly expansive definition of “indefinitely confined voters.” Recall here that the increment of new indefinitely confined voters in the 2020 election in Wisconsin was more than five times the alleged Biden victory margin.

在威斯康辛州，同样存在与过度宽泛的“无限期约束选民”定义相关的大规模滥用行为。在这里回顾一下，在威斯康辛州2020年选举中，新的无限期限制选民人数的增量是所谓拜登获胜数目的5倍多。

While Democrat Party government officials cheated and gamed the electoral process across all six battleground states, many Republican government officials – from governors and state legislators to judges – did little or nothing to stand in their way.

虽然民主党政府官员在所有六个战场州欺骗和操弄了选举流程，但是很多共和党政府官员，从州长、州议员到法官，几乎没有或者说根本没有阻止民主党政府官员这些行为。

Consider that the Republican Party controls *both*chambers of the State Legislatures in five of the six battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.145 These State Legislatures clearly have both the power and the opportunity to investigate the six dimensions of election irregularities presented in this report. Yet, wilting under intense political pressure, these politicians have failed in their Constitutional duties and responsibilities to do so – and thereby failed both their states and this nation as well as their party.

考虑到共和党控制着六个战场州-亚利桑那州、佐治亚州、密歇根州、宾夕法尼亚州和威斯康辛州中的五个州的州议会两院。这些州议会明显既有权力又有机会调查本报告指出的选举违规的六个方面。然而，这些政客屈服于强大的政治压力，没有履行宪法赋予他们的责任和义务，因此也辜负了他们的州和这个国家以及他们所属的政党。

The same can be said for the Republican governors in two of the six battleground states – Arizona and Georgia. Both Arizona’s Doug Ducey and Georgia’s Brian Kemp have cowered in their Governor’s mansions and effectively sat on their hands while their states have wallowed in election irregularities.

对于六个战场州中的亚利桑那州和佐治亚州的共和党州长也是如此。亚利桑那州的道格·杜西(Doug Ducey)和佐治亚州的布莱恩·肯普(Brain Kemp)都蜷缩在他们的豪宅里，实际上就是袖手旁观。而他们的州深陷在选举违规行为的沼潭里。

The judicial branch of the American government should be the final backstop for the kind of issues examined in this report. Yet both our State courts and Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, have failed the American people in refusing to properly adjudicate the election irregularities that have come before them. Their failures likewise pose a great risk to the American Republic.

美国政府的司法部门应该是本报告所要审查这些问题的最终认定来源。然而，我们州法院和联邦法院，包括最高法院，对摆在他们面前的大选违规行为都拒绝作出妥当的裁决。他们已经辜负了美国人民而且他们的不作为给美利坚合众国带来了巨大的风险。
