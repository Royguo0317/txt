## 美国新老政府的最大争执就是病毒报告
` Himalaya Rose Garden Team` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/1020925/)

简述：在2021年3月15日盖特视频中，郭先生披露美国川普政府和拜登政府之间最大的争执是病毒报告，中共已经准备承认病毒不是自然产生的，而是实验室泄漏。 但是，世卫组织在中国吃喝玩乐以后，私下建议中共否认一切，从而彻底激怒了绝大多数的美国高层，使他们从之前对中共的纵容态度，彻底转向承认中共故意制造病毒。

**美国新老政府的最大争执就是病毒报告**

**The Main Conflict Between the Trump and Biden Administrations Lies in the Virus Report**

我再告诉大家一个更核心的问题，可能你们还不知道。就在那个之后，美国内部掀起了轩然大波，就是病毒报告。新政府和老政府争执的最大的问题，就是病毒报告。

I will tell you about another key issue that you may not know yet. After the Taiwan incident, the issue that set off the uproar in the US was the virus report. The main conflict between the Trump and Biden administrations lies in the virus report.

绝大多数人认为这不是共产党病毒，是叫无意泄露，叫无意的武汉实验室试验泄露。这才导演了WHO到所谓的武汉，走那么一圈，回来定义的结果就是一个，无意的或者是试验事故。已经要承认了，这不是自然的。大家你看这个过程。不是自然的，不是自然学说，否了，但是武汉实验室是自然泄露，或者是某个人所为。等了WHO这帮王八蛋到了中国，吃喝玩乐以后，给他们私下建议，说你这根本不能说泄露，泄露没必要，这就不是你干的。

The vast majority of the people believed that the virus was not released by the CCP. Rather it was an unintentional leak from the Wuhan lab. That’s why the WHO people flied to Wuhan and came back with this conclusion: it was unintentional, or a lab accident. At that point, the CCP was already going to admit that it was not natural origin. Do you see the whole development? The natural origin theory was about to be negated, and the CCP was going to admit that the virus was a leak from the Wuhan lab or caused by an individual person. But those WHO bastards went to China, ate and drank, and then privately suggested that the CCP should not admit that it was a leak at all and there was no need to admit it because it was not done by the CCP at all.

最后也是中共上面昏了头了，据说是军方还有中国杨娘娘、王太监都说：“这就不能承认，也不能他说泄露，就不是他干的。”就像欺民贼一样，就像九指妖一样，到临死咬着屎橛子不带松口的，她以为自己那叫强硬，她不知道咬着屎橛子。

Finally, the CCP’s higher-ups were not thinking clear. It’s said that some PLA personnels and concubine Yang (Yang Jiechi) and eunuch Wang (Wang Yi) all agreed that they should not admit anything, including the leak. Instead they should deny that they had anything to do with this. Just like those pro-democracy phonies and the nine-fingered demoness (referring to Sara of VOG), they are on the verge of being destroyed but still play tough. They think this makes them look tough, they think it is called tough, but what they are holding onto is just shit.

最后就演了一场戏，推出去，从非自然到人为的无意泄露，或事故，到推出去，跟他没关系。惹怒了美国，“啪”调转回来了，原来绝大多数要支持是实验室失误泄露的人，现在全回去了，绝大多数人说，这就是你故意制造的生化病毒。而且是很早就完成的。这一下赢了。

In the end, they put up this show, from potentially admitting that the virus was from an unnatural source to an unintentional lab leak or an accident to denying everything all together. This has really made the US furious. The situation was then turned back around. The overwhelming majority of people, who used to support the idea that it was a lab leaking accident, are now turning to believe that it is a biochemical virus that you, the CCP, created on purpose. Moreover, you have been doing this for a long time. Bingo, we won!
