2020年12月28日川普总统签署公告，宣布12月29日为圣托马斯·贝克特殉道850周年纪念日。850年前，托马斯·贝克特为捍卫宗教自由而献出生命。当今世界局势充满着正义与邪恶的较量，坚守人类的精神信仰、坚守个人宗教信仰的权利，是创建一个和平、繁荣和道德的社会的基石。 美国将永远捍卫宗教自由。

“我们为各地因信仰而受迫害的宗教信徒祈祷。我们特别为他们的勇敢和鼓舞人心的牧者祈祷，如香港的枢机陈日君主教和成都的王怡牧师，他们是不懈的希望的见证。”

全文翻译：

Today is the 850th anniversary of the martyrdom of Saint Thomas Becket on December 29, 1170. Thomas Becket was a statesman, a scholar, a chancellor, a priest, an archbishop, and a lion of religious liberty.

今天是圣徒托马斯·贝克特（出生于1170年12月29日）殉道850周年纪念日，托马斯·贝克特是一位政治家、学者、校长、牧师，大主教，和自由信仰的勇士。

Before the Magna Carta was drafted, before the right to free exercise of religion was enshrined as America’s first freedom in our glorious Constitution, Thomas gave his life so that, as he said, “the Church will attain liberty and peace.”

在《大宪章》起草之前，在宗教信仰自由权被确立为美国光荣的宪法中的第一自由之前，托马斯为实现“教会将会获得自由与和平”献出了他的生命。

The son of a London sheriff and once described as “a lowborn clerk” by the King who had him killed, Thomas Becket rose to become the leader of the church in England. When the crown attempted to encroach upon the affairs of the house of God through the Constitutions of Clarendon, Thomas refused to sign the offending document. When the furious King Henry II threatened to hold him in contempt of royal authority and questioned why this “poor and humble” priest would dare defy him, Archbishop Becket responded “God is the supreme ruler, above Kings” and “we ought to obey God rather than men.”

生为伦敦警长的儿子，曾被国王称作“低出生的职员”并被国王杀害，托马斯·贝克特成为了英国教会的领袖。当国王企图通过《克拉伦登宪法》侵犯教会的事务时，托马斯·贝克特拒绝在侵犯文件上签字。当暴怒的亨利二世威胁他要为蔑视皇权付出代价、并疑惑为什么这个又穷又卑微的牧师胆敢违抗自己的时候，贝克特大主教回答他说：”上帝是至高统治者，在国王之上”，还说“我们要遵从上帝，而非凡人。”

Because Thomas would not assent to rendering the church subservient to the state, he was forced to forfeit all his property and flee his own country. Years later, after the intervention of the Pope, Becket was allowed to return — and continued to resist the King’s oppressive interferences into the life of the church. Finally, the King had enough of Thomas Becket’s stalwart defense of religious faith and reportedly exclaimed in consternation: “Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?”

因为托马斯不愿让教会屈从皇权，他失去了自己所有的财富并流落他国。多年以后，经过教皇的干涉，托马斯·贝克特被允许回国， 他依然反抗国王对教会的干涉。最终，国王受够了托马斯·贝克特对宗教信仰的坚定保卫，据说他惊恐地大叫：“就没有人来为我处理这个爱管闲事的牧师吗？”

The King’s knights responded and rode to Canterbury Cathedral to deliver Thomas Becket an ultimatum: give in to the King’s demands or die. Thomas’s reply echoes around the world and across the ages. His last words on this earth were these: “For the name of Jesus and the protection of the Church, I am ready to embrace death.” Dressed in holy robes, Thomas was cut down where he stood inside the walls of his own church.

国王的骑士们接受了命令，骑马赶到坎特伯雷大教堂对托马斯·贝克特发出了最后通牒：要么屈从皇权，要么死。托马斯的回答跨越时代在世界各地广为传颂。他在地球上的最后几句话是：“为了耶稣的名，并保护教会，我以准备好了拥抱死亡。” 托马斯穿着神圣的礼服，站在自己的教会里被杀害。

Thomas Becket’s martyrdom changed the course of history. It eventually brought about numerous constitutional limitations on the power of the state over the Church across the West. In England, Becket’s murder led to the Magna Carta’s declaration 45 years later that: “[T]he English church shall be free, and shall have its rights undiminished and its liberties unimpaired.”

托马斯·贝克特的殉道改变了历史的进程，最终促成西方出台了许多宪法以约束皇权管辖教会。 在英格兰，贝克特的谋杀导致45年后《大宪章》的宣言：“ 教会是自由的，权利不减，自由不减。”

When the Archbishop refused to allow the King to interfere in the affairs of the Church, Thomas Becket stood at the intersection of church and state. That stand, after centuries of state-sponsored religious oppression and religious wars throughout Europe, eventually led to the establishment of religious liberty in the New World. It is because of great men like Thomas Becket that the first American President George Washington could proclaim more than 600 years later that, in the United States, “All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship” and that “it is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights.”

当大主教拒绝国王干涉教会事务时，托马斯·贝克特站在教会和政权交汇的十字路口。他的立场，经过几个世纪遍布欧洲的由政权支持的宗教压迫和宗教战争之后，最终导致了新世界宗教自由的建立。因为像托马斯·贝克特这类伟人的付出，美国第一任总统乔治·华盛顿600多年后在美国宣布：“所有人都享有同样的良心自由和公民豁免权”及“论及宽容，现在不再是放纵的一类人说另一类人享受了其固有的与生具有的权利。”

Thomas Becket’s death serves as a powerful and timeless reminder to every American that our freedom from religious persecution is not a mere luxury or accident of history, but rather an essential element of our liberty. It is our priceless treasure and inheritance. And it was bought with the blood of martyrs.

托马斯·贝克特之死有力而永恒地提醒着每一个美国人，我们免于宗教迫害的自由不仅仅是历史的奢侈品或偶然，而是自由的基本要素，是我们无价的财富和遗产，是用烈士的鲜血换来的。

As Americans, we were first united by our belief that “rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God” and that defending liberty is more important than life itself. If we are to continue to be the land of the free, no government official, no governor, no bureaucrat, no judge, and no legislator must be allowed to decree what is orthodox in matters of religion or to require religious believers to violate their consciences. No right is more fundamental to a peaceful, prosperous, and virtuous society than the right to follow one’s religious convictions. As I declared in Krasiński Square in Warsaw, Poland on July 6, 2017, the people of America and the people of the world still cry out: “We want God.”

作为美国人，我们首先是因这样的信念而团结在一起的，即“对暴君的反抗就是对上帝的服从”，捍卫自由比生命本身更重要。如果我们要继续成为自由之邦，就不得允许任何政府官员、州长、官员、法官和立法者来裁决何为宗教事务的正统，或要求宗教信徒违背自己的良心。坚守个人宗教信仰的权利，是创建一个和平、繁荣和道德的社会的基石，没有任何权利能与之相比。正如2017年7月6日我在波兰华沙的克拉辛斯基滑雪广场宣告的那样，美国人民和世界人民仍然在大声疾呼:“我们需要上帝。”

On this day, we celebrate and revere Thomas Becket’s courageous stand for religious liberty and we reaffirm our call to end religious persecution worldwide. In my historic address to the United Nations last year, I made clear that America stands with believers in every country who ask only for the freedom to live according to the faith that is within their own hearts. I also stated that global bureaucrats have absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life, reflecting the belief held by the United States and many other countries that every child — born and unborn — is a sacred gift from God. Earlier this year, I signed an Executive Order to prioritize religious freedom as a core dimension of United States foreign policy. We have directed every Ambassador — and the over 13,000 United States Foreign Service officers and specialists — in more than 195 countries to promote, defend, and support religious freedom as a central pillar of American diplomacy.

今天，我们庆祝并对托马斯·贝克特勇于捍卫宗教自由的立场致以深切的敬意，我们再次呼吁结束全球范围内的宗教迫害。去年，我在联合国发表的历史性讲话中明确表示，美国与每一个国家的信仰者站在一起，这些信仰者只要求有按照自己内心的信仰生活的自由。我还指出，对那些希望保护无辜生命的国家，全球的官僚们绝对无权攻击这些国家的主权，这也反映了美国和许多其它国家的信念，即每个出生和未出生的孩子都是上帝赐予的神圣礼物。今年早些时候，我签署了一项行政命令，将宗教自由列为优先级别，以作为美国外交政策考量的核心标尺。我们已指示195多个国家的每一位大使， 以及1万3千多名美国外交官员和专家们努力促进、捍卫和支持宗教自由，并将其作为美国外交的中心支柱。

We pray for religious believers everywhere who suffer persecution for their faith. We especially pray for their brave and inspiring shepherds — like Cardinal Joseph Zen of Hong Kong and Pastor Wang Yi of Chengdu — who are tireless witnesses to hope.

我们为各地因信仰而受迫害的宗教信徒祈祷。我们特别为他们的勇敢和鼓舞人心的牧者祈祷，如香港的枢机陈日君主教和成都的王怡牧师，他们是不懈的希望的见证。

To honor Thomas Becket’s memory, the crimes against people of faith must stop, prisoners of conscience must be released, laws restricting freedom of religion and belief must be repealed, and the vulnerable, the defenseless, and the oppressed must be protected. The tyranny and murder that shocked the conscience of the Middle Ages must never be allowed to happen again. As long as America stands, we will always defend religious liberty.

为了纪念托马斯·贝克特，必须制止迫害信仰者的罪行，必须释放良心犯，必须废除限制宗教和信仰自由的法律，必须保护弱势群体、手无寸铁者和被压迫者。让震惊了中世纪良心的暴政和谋杀绝不能再发生。只要美国屹立在这里，我们将永远捍卫宗教自由。

A society without religion cannot prosper. A nation without faith cannot endure — because justice, goodness, and peace cannot prevail without the grace of God.

一个没有宗教的社会无法繁荣；一个没有信仰的国家无法长存 — 因为如果没有上帝的恩典，正义、良善与和平将无法繁衍昌盛。

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 29, 2020, as the 850th anniversary of the martyrdom of Saint Thomas Becket. I invite the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches and customary places of meeting with appropriate ceremonies in commemoration of the life and legacy of Thomas Becket.

为此，我，美利坚合众国总统唐纳德·川普，根据宪法和美国法律赋予我的权力，特此宣布2020年12月29日为圣托马斯·贝克特殉道850周年纪念日。我请美国人民此日在学校、教堂和传统的集会场所举行适当的仪式，以纪念托马斯·贝克特的一生和影响。

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.

特此宣告：我谨于公元两千二〇年，即美利坚合众国独立第二百四十五周年，十二月二十八日亲笔在此签名为证。

DONALD J. TRUMP

唐纳德·川普
