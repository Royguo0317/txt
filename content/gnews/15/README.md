英文標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep220:  The CCP’s cancellation of Mongolian language teaching has caused strong backlash and protests

視頻重點

1. 中共取消蒙古語教學，已經造成當地蒙古族人民的強烈反彈及抗議。數萬蒙古族學生和家長發起罷課及抗議集會等各種抵制活動，當局強令維穩。
2. 中共國警察光天化日之下在街頭揮舞棍棒野蠻執法，有人被打死。
3. 今天是時隔香港831太子站手足遇難一周年的紀念日，香港人在街頭自發的舉辦紀念犧牲的手足，不放棄追查手足死去的真相，不放棄追求自由民主法治等天賦人權。這次該我們贏了。
4. Steve Bannon）首先你說，中共從來未能成功地為動物做出疫苗，更不用說人用疫苗；第二，在六個月裡世界上最厲害的生物製藥專家以及最偉大的醫藥大學埋頭苦幹，離研究完成都還很遙遠，中共的人如何能造出疫苗？第三，你的意思是你認為死在測試假疫苗的人比死於病毒的人更多？            (郭文貴）是的先生，100%。
5. （8/30連線台灣遊行戰友們）台灣人啊信佛信儒家，而且是中國文化的善良的一面，最美好的保留的地方。共產黨不是什麼極權主義，它就是流氓主義。他絕對就是流氓主義和黑幫主義。


1. The CCP’s cancellation of Mongolian language teaching has caused strong backlash and protests among the local Mongolian people. Tens of thousands of Mongolian students and parents launched various boycott activities such as strikes and protest rallies, and the authorities forced the maintenance of stability.
2. In broad daylight, Communist China’s police wielded batons during the brutal law enforcement. Some people were killed.
3. On August 31 last year, many people were killed at the Prince Edward Station in Hong Kong. Today is the first 831 anniversary of the death of these compatriots. Hong Kong people spontaneously commemorate their sacrificed siblings on the streets. Don’t give up tracing the truth about the death of our compatriots.
4. (Steve Bannon) You’re saying first off the CCP has never been able to successfully make a vaccine for animals much less humans; No.2: in six months when you get the greatest biological pharma guys in the world and the greatest universities doing it, they’re not even close, how did these guys come up with; and No.3: you’re saying more people, you’re putting out there, you believe more people died in test taking the vaccine than actually died in the coronavirus?              (Miles Guo) Yeah 100% Sir.
5. (8/30) Taiwanese people believe in Buddhism and Confucianism. Taiwan also preserves the most benevolent and finest aspects of the Chinese culture. The Communist Party are not just totalitarianism. They’re simply thuggish. Absolutely thuggish mafia. Consensus has been reached across the world to define them as thuggish mafia organization.
