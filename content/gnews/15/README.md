总统先生：

我很感谢今天下午有机会向您介绍我部对2020年大选中投票舞弊指控的审查情况，以及将如何继续追究这些指控。在这个国家分裂如此严重的时候，这是各级政府义不容辞的责任，所有机构在其职权范围内采取行动，尽我们所能确保选举的公正性，并促进公众对选举结果的信心。

我非常荣幸您再次邀请我作为司法部长，为您的政府和美国人民服务。我很自豪能在您为美国人民带来的许多成功和空前成就中发挥作用。您可名垂青史，因为您是在无情的、不断的干扰下完成了（这些成就）。您在2016年就职的演讲中向对手伸出（和解）之手，呼吁为美国人民的利益共同努力，但立即遭到了一场针对您的党派性攻击，在这场攻击中，（对手）不择手段、诽谤和欺骗，毫不收敛。对手攻击的目的是，通过疯狂和毫无根据的与俄罗斯串通的指控，来削弱甚至推翻您的政府。

很少有人能够经受住这些袭击，更不用说（您顶住了攻击）为国家制定了一个通向（更大）成功的蓝图；您建立了美国历史上最强大、最具活力的经济体，这为国家带来了前所未有和不可预测的进步；您恢复了美国的军事力量；通过在中东斡旋达成历史性的和平协议，您实现了大多数人认为不可能实现的目标；您遏制了非法移民，加强了我国边境的安全；您任命了创纪录数量的致力于宪法原则的法官，促进了法治；通过“翘曲速度”行动，您按照没有人能想到的时间表交付了冠状病毒疫苗，这一壮举无疑将拯救数百万人的生命。

在您执政期间，司法部不遗余力地保护公众免遭暴力犯罪；与墨西哥领导人密切合作，打击贩毒集团；打击中共国对我国经济和工人的剥削；捍卫市场竞争，特别是技术领域的竞争；支持执法人员，他们无私地——而且往往是吃力不讨好地冒着生命危险来保护我们社区的安全。

如前所述，我将用下周来处理那些对政府来说很重要的事情，然后于12月23日离开。

祝您，梅拉尼娅和您的家人圣诞快乐，节日快乐。

上帝保佑

英文原文：

Dear Mr. President,

I appreciate the opportunity to update you this afternoon on the Department’s review of voter fraud allegations in the 2020 election and how these allegations will continue to be pursued. At a time when the country is so deeply divided, it is incumbent on all levels of government, and all agencies acting within their purview to do all we can to assure the integrity of elections and promote public confidence in their outcome.

I am greatly honored that you called on me to serve your Administration and the American people once again as Attorney General. I am proud to have played a role in the many successes and unprecedented achievements you have delivered for the American people.

Your record is all the more historic because you accomplished it in the face of relentless, implacable resistance. Your 2016 victory speech in which you reached out to your opponents and called for working together for the benefit of the American people was immediately met by a partisan onslaught against you in which no tactic, no matter how abusive and deceitful, was out of bounds. The nadir of this campaign was the effort to cripple, if not oust, your Administration with frenzied and baseless accusations of collusion with Russia.

Few could have weathered these attacks, much less forge ahead with a positive program for the country. You built the strongest and most resilient economy in American history-one that has brought unprecedented progress to those previously left out. You have restored American military strength. By brokering historic peace deals in the Mideast you have achieved what most thought impossible. You have curbed illegal immigration and enhanced the security of our nation’s borders. You have advanced the rule of law by appointing a record number of judges committed to constitutional principles. With Operation Warp Speed, you delivered a vaccine for coronavirus on a schedule no one thought conceivable-a feat that will undoubtedly save millions of lives.

During your Administration, the Department of Justice has worked tirelessly to protect the public from violent crime; worked closely with leaders in Mexico to fight the drug cartels; cracked down on China’s exploitation of our economy and workers; defended competition in the marketplace, especially the technology sector; and supported the men and women of law enforcement, who selflessly — and too often thanklessly—risk their lives to keep our communities safe.

As discussed, I will spend the next week wrapping up a few remaining matters important to the Administration and depart on December 23rd.

Wishing you, Melania, and your family a Merry Christmas and a Blessed Holiday Season.

God Bless
