## VI. Equal Protection Clause Violations

## VI. 平等保护条款违例

The Equal Protection Clause is part of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and a fundamental pillar of the American Republic. This Equal Protection Clause mandates that no State may deny its citizens equal protection of its governing laws.

平等保护条款是美国宪法第十四条修正案的一部分，也是美利坚合众国的根本支柱。平等保护条款规定，任何州不能否认其公民受到该地区管辖法律的平等保护。

Table 6 illustrates three major alleged violations of the Equal Protection Clause in the 2020 presidential election. As the table illustrates, each violation was observed to occur across all six battleground states.

图表6列举了在2020年美国总统竞选中三个主要的涉嫌违反平等保护条款的行为。如表所示，在六个战场州中，每一项违规都存在。

### Higher Standards of Certification & I.D. Verification Applied to In-Person Voters

### 对亲自投票的选民采取更高标准的认证与身份核实

The first alleged violation focuses on the application of higher standards of certification and voter identification for in-person voters than mail-in and absentee ballot voters. In effect, these higher standards disproportionately benefited the candidacy of Joe Biden because President Trump had a much higher percentage of in-person voters than mail-in and absentee voters. Indeed, mail-in and absentee ballots were largely skewed for Joe Biden across the country by ratios as high as 3 out of 4 votes in some states.

第一起被指控的违规行为集中于对亲自投票的选民采用比邮寄选票和不在场选票更高的身份认证标准。实际上，这些更高的标准不成比例地有利了乔·拜登的竞选，因为在百分比上，川普总统在亲自投票上比邮寄与缺席投票上占有更高的比例。事实上，在全国范围内，邮寄和缺席选票很大程度上偏向乔·拜登，在某些州的比例高达四分之三。

Note here that much of the alleged fraud and ballot mishandling focused on mail-in voters and absentee ballots. Therefore, the lower the level of scrutiny of these voters, the more illegal votes for Joe Biden relative to Donald Trump could slip in. It should likewise be noted here that this particular violation of the Equal Protection Clause was further enabled by poll watchers being denied meaningful observation.

需要注意的是，许多所谓的欺诈和选票处理不当都集中于邮寄选票和缺席选票中。因此，对这类选民的审查水平越低，相对于唐纳德·川普，乔·拜登获得的非法选票就越多。这里同样应当指出的是，由于投票监督员拒绝接受有异议的监督这种特别违反平等保护条款的行为被进一步扩大。

Perhaps the most egregious examples of this particular violation of the Equal Protection clause occurred in Georgia and Michigan. Georgia, for example, requires ID for voting in-person and Michigan will only allow provisional voting without an ID. However, in both Georgia and Michigan, a valid ID is not required to vote by mail so long as the person has already registered in a previous election.

这种最令人震惊的特别违反平等保护条款的行为发生在佐治亚州和密歇根州。例如，佐治亚州要求亲自投票必须有身份证，密歇根州只允许无身份证明的人进行临时投票。然而，在佐治亚州和密歇根州，邮寄选票不需要有效身份证，只要当事人在以前选举中登记过。

These procedures are ripe for fraud. In fact, there is evidence that election fraudsters targeted voters who had voted in past elections but not voted in more recent ones. These fraudsters could then cast ballots on behalf of these infrequent voters with little likelihood they would be caught. Numerous affidavits, however, detail persons arriving to vote at polls only to be informed that records indicate they had already voted. At least fourteen such affidavits have been made by Georgians.

这些程序很容易发生欺诈。事实上，有证据表明，选举作假人员专门选中在过去选举中投过票但在最近几次选举中没有投票的选民。这些作假人员可以代表这些不常投票的选民投票，而且他们被抓的可能性很小。然而，选多宣誓书详细阐述了前往投票处投票的人被告知记录表明他们已经投票。佐治亚居民至少做出了十四封这样的宣誓书。

As a further example, in Wisconsin, mail-in ballots were accepted without witness signatures placed properly in the allocated envelope location. A comparable process for in-person voting would have resulted in the invalidation of the vote.

再例如，在威斯康辛州，邮寄的选票没有在分配的信封位置适当地放置证人签名就被接受。此类似的过程如果发生在亲自投票中将会导致投票无效。

### Different Standards of Ballot Curing

### 不同标准的选票纠正

As a second major violation of the Equal Protection Clause, likewise observed across all six battleground states, different standards for correcting mistakes on ballots (ballot curing) were applied across different jurisdictions within the states. Often, jurisdictions with predominantly Democrat registration were more expansive about allowing the curing of ballots than jurisdictions with predominantly Republican registration.

统一发生在所有六个战场州的第二个重大违反平等保护条款的事件是，各州不同司法管辖区对纠正选票错误（选票修正）采用了不同的标准。通常情况下，民主党选民占多数的选区比共和党选民占多数的选区在允许处理选票方面更为广泛。

In Pennsylvania, there was a clear difference between how ballots were – or were not – cured in Republican counties versus Democrat counties. When Pennsylvania’s Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar issued illegal guidance authorizing counties to cure ballots, this illegal guidance was not followed in at least eight different Republican counties.  Meanwhile, ballots were cured in Democrat counties under this illegal guidance.

在宾夕法尼亚州，共和党县和民主党县的是否与如何进行选票修正上存在明显差异。当宾夕法尼亚州的国务卿卡西·布克瓦发布授权各县用于修正选票的非法指导文件，至少有八个不同的共和党县没有遵循这一非法指导文件。与此同时，选票在民主党县中，在这种非法指导下被更正与修正。

In Arizona, there likewise was a clear difference between how in-person voters were treated versus mail-in ballots. On the one hand, mail-in voters had up to 5 days to “cure” or “fix” invalid mail-in ballots sent prior to Election Day. On the other hand, in-person voters in Maricopa County, for example, had to deal with poll workers who did not know how to work electronic voting machines properly. This resulted in thousands of in-person votes being marked incorrectly and disregarded rather than cured.

在亚利桑那州，亲自投票和邮寄投票的区别也很明显。一方面，邮寄选票的选民有5天的时间来“纠正”或“修正”在选举日之前邮寄出去的无效选票。另一方面，例如在马里科帕县，亲自投票的选民不得不面对不知道如何正确使用电子投票机的投票工作人员。这导致成千上万的亲自投票被错误标记并废弃，而不是被纠正。

### Differential and Partisan Poll Watcher Treatment

### 党派间投票监督员不同的待遇

In most states, political party candidates and ballot issue committees are able to appoint poll watchers and observers to oversee the ballot counting process. Such poll watchers and observers must be registered voters and present certification to the Judge of Elections in order to be able to fulfill their duties at a polling location.

在大多数州，政党候选人和选票发放委员会能够任命投票监督员和观察员监督计票过程。这些投票监督员和观察员必须是登记选民，并且向选举法官出示证明，才能在投票地点路线职责。

Such certified poll watchers should be free to observe at appropriate distances regardless of their party affiliation. Yet in key Democrat strongholds, e.g., Dane County in Wisconsin and Wayne County in Michigan, which yielded high Biden vote counts, Republican poll watchers and observers were frequently subject to different treatment ranging from denial of entry to polling places to harassment and intimidation.

这些经过认证的投票监督员无论党派分别，都应当能够自由地在适当的距离观察选票。但是，在民主党的地盘，例如威斯康辛州的戴恩县和密歇根州的韦恩县，在这些拜登选票数量高的县，共和党的投票监督员和观察员经常受到拒绝进入投票站，骚扰和恐吓等不同待遇。

For example, in Georgia, a certified poll watcher witnessed other poll workers at a polling location discussing how they should not speak to her due to her party affiliation. In Pennsylvania, a Republican poll watcher was harassed and removed from the polling location due to his party affiliation. In Wisconsin, a Republican poll watcher was prevented from observing due to the fact that polling locations were not allowing Republicans in.

例如，在佐治亚州，一名认证的投票监督员目睹了投票站其他工作人员讨论由于她的党派关系，如何避免与她交流。在宾夕法尼亚州，一名共和党的监督员因为他的党派而遭受到骚扰并被赶出了投票站。在威斯康辛州，由于投票站禁止共和党人进入，一名共和党投票监督员被阻止监督。

Note the synergy here between the problem of the process foul involved with denying access to certified poll watchers (discussed in the previous section) and the violation of the Equal Protection Clause such conduct entails when such denial, harassment, and intimidation differs by party affiliation.

注意这里的协同效应，拒绝获得认证的投票监督员的访问（前一节中讨论过）所涉及的程序违规的问题，以及违反平等保护条款的行为使得这种拒绝、骚扰、恐吓的事件因党派不同而发生。
