新闻简述：川普总统签署了对弗林将军的全权赦免令。该命令意义深远，它不仅将正义还给一位无辜的美国英雄—弗林将军，同时也提醒了全体美国人民要对拥有巨大权力的政府和情报部门的高官们进行严密监督，以确保他们维护美国的民主法治而不是追求党派政治见解（站在各自党派立场打击对手）。这项在感恩节之际签署的赦免令，最完美地表达了感恩节的象征意义。

Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Grant of Clemency granting a Full Pardon to General Michael T. Flynn.  The President has pardoned General Flynn because he should never have been prosecuted.  An independent review of General Flynn’s case by the Department of Justice—conducted by respected career professionals—supports this conclusion.  In fact, the Department of Justice has firmly concluded that the charges against General Flynn should be dropped.  This Full Pardon achieves that objective, finally bringing to an end the relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man.

今天，唐纳德·J·川普总统签署了《行政赦免令》，全权赦免迈克尔·T·弗林将军， 因为将军根本就不应该受到起诉。 司法部对弗林将军案的独立审查（由享有信誉的专业人员进行的此项审查）支持了这一结论。 事实上，司法部已经坚定地得出结论，对弗林将军的指控应该被撤销。 全权赦免充分实现了这一目标，最终结束了党派对一个无辜者的不懈追打。

General Flynn should not require a pardon.  He is an innocent man.  Even the FBI agents who interviewed General Flynn did not think he was lying.  Multiple investigations have produced evidence establishing that General Flynn was the victim of partisan government officials engaged in a coordinated attempt to subvert the election of 2016.  These individuals sought to prevent Donald Trump from being elected to the Presidency, to block him from assuming that office upon his election, to remove him from office after his inauguration, and to undermine his Administration at every turn.

弗林将军不需要赦免，他本来就是一个无辜的人。就连采访过弗林将军的联邦调查局特工也不认为他在撒谎。多项调查显示，弗林将军是党派政府官员蓄意破坏 2016 年大选的受害者。这些人试图阻止唐纳德·川普当选总统，阻止他当选后就职，甚至在他的就职宣誓后把他赶下台，并在每一个层面削弱他的政府影响力。

The prosecution of General Flynn is yet another reminder of something that has long been clear:  After the 2016 election, individuals within the outgoing administration refused to accept the choice the American people had made at the ballot box and worked to undermine the peaceful transition of power.  These efforts were enabled by a complicit media that willingly published falsehoods and hid inconvenient facts from public view, including with respect to General Flynn.  They amounted to a brazen assault on our democracy and a direct attack on our fundamental political values.

对弗林将军的起诉再次提醒人们一个长期以来就已经很清楚的事实：2016 年大选之后，即将离任的政府内部人士拒绝接受由美国人民通过投票做出的选择，并试图破坏权力的和平过渡。他们让一个串通一气的媒体，自愿公开发表虚假信息，在公众视野中隐藏不利事实，包括对弗林将军的虚假报道。他们对我们的民主制度进行了无耻的攻击，对我们基本政治价值观进行了直接攻击。

While today’s action sets right an injustice against an innocent man and an American hero, it should also serve as a reminder to all of us that we must remain vigilant over those in whom we place our trust and confidence.  The people who sit atop our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have tremendous power to affect the lives of their fellow citizens.  The American people must always take care to scrutinize their actions, to hold them accountable, and to ensure that they use their immense power to uphold the rule of law rather than to harass, persecute, and jail their political opponents in pursuit of partisan political agendas.

虽然今天的行动纠正了对一位无辜的人和一位美国英雄的不公正待遇，但它也应该提醒我们所有人，我们必须对那些我们所信任和有信心的人保持警惕。我们情报机构和执法机构的高层人员拥有巨大的权力来影响公民们的生活，美国人民必须自始自终地谨慎审查他们的行动，追究他们的责任，并确保他们运用自己的巨大权力来维护法治，而不是为了追求党派政治见解而骚扰、迫害和监禁他们的政治对手。

Happy Thanksgiving to General Flynn and his family, and thank you all for your great service to our Nation!

祝弗林将军和他的家人感恩节快乐，感谢你们所有人对我们国家的伟大贡献!
