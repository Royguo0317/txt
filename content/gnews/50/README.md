新闻简述：郭先生在2021年2月6日的盖特视频中说，一位特别重要的美国朋友说美国各地都在问疫情的减缓和美国大选到底有什么关系。他还通过一位中共国内部战友透露的信息判断，中共国一定有解药。他告诉西方朋友：“你们要想好，要想安全，找共产党要解药！要想安全，要想好，少传染，真正解决问题，少和共产党合作！”

**中共病毒和美国大选有什么关系？共产党有解药！**

**What’s the Relationship Between the CCP Virus and the US Election? The CCP Has Antidote!**

在一个小时以前，咱们特别重要的美国朋友说，现在，在华盛顿，在纽约，在芝加哥，在德克萨斯州，在洛杉矶，这些地方都在问同一个问题：“病毒在这个时候，所谓的传染力的降下，死亡率的提高，和共产党，和美国大选有什么关系？”

An hour ago, our very important American friends said that now people in Washington D.C., New York, Chicago, Texas and Los Angeles all asked the same question – whether the so-called “reduced infectivity” and “increased mortality” of the virus are related to the CCP and the US election?

英国现在这几天有所好转，所有的英国人都在问一个问题：[让]英国死的人，[给]英国造成的经济损失，和[让]英国受到最大伤害的共产党病毒，和现在，英国一硬起来，一开始灭共，病毒现在有所好转[这个事实之间]，又有什么内在的关系？连法国内部都在问：“现在法国跟共产党一对抗，反而病毒有所下降，连死亡率都有所下降，这又有什么必然的关系？”

In the UK, the situation has got better in the past few days, and the British people are all asking one question. The CCP virus has killed people, caused economic damages and let the UK bear the worst suffering ever in history, but once the UK became tougher against the CCP and started to take down the CCP, the situation of the virus then became better, so what is the inner relationship of these two things? Questions are also raised inside France – now France is standing up against the CCP, but the virus has come down somewhat, even the mortality rate is down, so what are the connections between these things?

所有[以上这些]，大家要记住，英国和法国稍微有点儿想硬起来，[它们]这个表现只是在真相[问题]上若有所“硬”，也就是说，[它们]事实上跟共产党减少了接触和合作，少用了共产党的疫苗，少用了共产党派来的所谓“技术”和“协助合作人员”，[它们]的病毒就下来了。这又意味着什么？

So, what we need to remember is that whenever the UK and France became a little tougher on pressing the truth about the virus, that is to say, reducing their interaction and cooperation with the CCP, using less CCP’s vaccines and less so-called “technicians” and “assistants” sent by the CCP, their virus would go down. What does that mean?

这位美国朋友，马上就要去欧洲。我说：“你去欧洲，抛开你官方的身份。按照 Miles Guo 的建议，了解了解欧洲。为什么你们一和老共之间，减少交往和合作，病毒[这些率]就下来了？也就是说，你硬了一点点儿，就下来了。”

This American friend of mine is going to Europe. I said, “When you are in Europe, forget about your government official identity. Follow Miles Guo’s advice and learn about Europe, asking why the virus went down whenever the amount of interaction and cooperation with the CCP was reduced? That is to say, whenever you got a little tougher, the virus went down.”

那么我想问战友们，国内的病毒，现在是什么地方最严重？凡是天天举着红旗，凡是天天跟着中南坑几个老杂毛混的地方，全都出大事啦，对吧？就香港现在这个掏肛，掏到这种程度，香港目前还是中国，所谓发达地区[中]感染率最低的。因为香港人，不愿意跟老共合作，香港人减少了去共产党的“共匪控制区”，对吧，战友们？

Then I want to ask our fellow fighters what places in mainland China have had the most serious outbreaks? Places where people wave red flags everyday and follow every move of the Zhongnan Pit’s old bastards, all had the worst outbreaks, right? Hong Kong however has the lowest infection rate among all the so-called “developed areas” in China even though Hong Kong is being humiliated by the CCP like this (by allowing the CCP to attack their anus). Because the Hongkongers aren’t willing to work with the CCP, and they travel to the areas controlled by the CCP bandits less frequently, am I right, my fellow fighters?

还有，昨天我们有的战友，发现了一个秘密，说：除了共产党高官不染病，高官不死人，他发现了一个很核心的秘密，共产党最近这一两个月的[时间]，你见过有医疗官员站出来说话的吗？因为咱这个战友的家人，在中国所谓的疾病防疫中心是个高官。[他]说这哥们儿该吃吃，该喝喝，从来不戴口罩。回到老家以后，叫着所有人，该吃吃该喝喝，他从来不戴口罩，而是非常自信。不但他不戴，他家人还不戴。

Also, a fellow fighter discovered a secret yesterday. He said that in addition to the fact that high ranking officials of the CCP did not get infected or die, he had discovered another core secret. In the past two months, have you ever seen any health official standing out to say anything? That’s because someone in this fellow fighter’s family is a high ranking official in the CCP’s CDC. He said that this buddy never worn a mask and dined out as usual like nothing had ever happened. When this guy went back to his hometown, he gathered all the people to eat together, never worn a mask, and seemed very confident about what he was doing. Not only he didn’t wear a mask, his family members didn’t wear masks either.

这一点，就是我这几天给西方所有的朋友说的：“共产党有解药！”它要没有解药，它控制不到这个程度。英国的首相，那肚子那脑子能传染上，加拿大的那小土豆能传染上，几十个国家的元首能传染上。中国的领导人，那身体怎么着？灌了什么了？有啥本事？天天还双修，都是些老杂毛儿身体又弱，还不戴口罩，他就没事儿？他有解药。

These days I’ve been telling all my western friends about this, “The CCP has the antidote!” If it didn’t have the antidote, it wouldn’t be able to control the virus so well. The UK Prime Minister has contracted the virus. Trudeau in Canada has contracted the virus. The leaders of a few dozens countries have got infected. How can the Chinese leaders stay healthy? What medicine have they poured into their mouth? What’s special about them? These old bastards have sex every day with their frail bodies. They don’t wear masks. Why haven’t they got infected? Because they have the antidote!

所以我告诉他们：“你们要想好，要想安全，找共产党要解药！要想安全，要想好，少传染，真正解决问题，少和共产党合作！”现在凡是想在共产党那块儿拿钱的，你必然早晚遭斩手，“坷”，不信走着看。

So I told them, “If you want to get well and be safe, go ask the CCP for the antidote!” If you want to get well, be safe and reduce infection rate, and truly solve the problem, cooperate less with the CCP! Now anyone who wants to take money from the CCP will eventually have his or her hand chopped off. “Thwack!” Let’s wait and see if you don’t believe it.
