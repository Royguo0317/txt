**摘要：在2021年4月11日的直播中，郭文贵先生说美国人在五四运动、八九六四、南海等事件时多次给中共机会，相信中共会在经济发达后让中国人有民主和自由。然而共产党最终又变回了流氓的本质 —— 这充分地反映在中共出的三本书中：[《中国可以说不》](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中国可以说不)、[《中国不高兴》](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中国不高兴)、[《厉害了，我的国》](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/厉害了，我的国)。他还揭露了2008年以来中共领导下的中国集体耍流氓不兑现对世贸组织承诺，在奥运会上集体耍流氓服用兴奋剂，以及渗透各种国际组织的真相。**

**三本书《中国可以说不》、《中国不高兴》、《厉害了，我的国》暴露了中共的流氓本质**

**The Three Books, *China Can Say No, Unhappy China*and*Amazing China,* Reveal the True Rogue Nature of the CCP**

那我再告诉大家美国人为什么要把你中共要从过去要支持的国家，逐渐地在八九六四、包括一系列的南海事件、包括飞机撞机等等等等等等，还支持你中共、支持中国。

Let me tell you why the Americans still support you CCP and support China as they did previously, even after the June Fourth Incident in 1989 and a series of incidents in the South China Sea including the plane crash and so on, and so on.

他支持的是中国人，他真不见得就支持你中共。相信了你中共，就你在一定的情况下、你经济发达了你就会让中国人有民主和自由。就你1913年到五四运动、到六四坦克碾压学生都可以让你过去，我前提是我再相信你一次、第三次相信你，让你经济发达、改革开放，相信邓小平了。

What they support is the Chinese people. They do not necessarily support you CCP. They trusted that you CCP could give the Chinese people democracy and freedom under certain circumstances when your economy is more developed. From 1913 to the May Fourth Movement, then to the June Fourth Incident when tanks ran over the students, I [America] let you go every time as I wanted to trust you one more time. I trusted you the third time and let you develop your economy, open and reform, and trusted Deng Xiaoping.

结果共产党又变成了流氓的本质——骗、假，然后就看到了这个情况。我说你看看，从八九六四以后中国出了本书叫《中国不高兴》。大家都记得有一本叫《中国不高兴》，中国不高兴啦，因为啥？因为中国改革开放了，有点钱了，中国不高兴了。大家记住啊叫持剑经商这个人写的，持剑经商。第二个叫《中国可以说不》，过了几年中国又来了个吹牛逼、牛叉。对不起啊，这是流氓嘴啊，不好。《中国可以说不》，大家还记得吧？到中国可以说不，再没几年习近平习大神、王岐山上来了。大家知道什么书吧？《厉害了，我的国》。

In the end, the CCP went back to its nature of rogue, that is, fraud and fakeness, which is what we see now. Look, after the June Fourth Incident in 1989, a book, called *Unhappy China*, was published in China. Everyone remembers a book called *Unhappy China*. China was not happy. Why? China became unhappy because it had its reform and opening and made some money. Everyone, remember that it was written by someone called Chijian Jingshang. The second book, called *China Can Say No*, came a few years later with more bragging (Chinese slang). Sorry, my words are too vulgar. No good. *China Can Say No*. Remember this book everyone? Another few years later, Xi Jinping the great god Xi and Wang Qishan came to power. You know what book was published then? *Amazing China*.

美国等来的就这三个——《中国可以说不》、《中国不高兴》到《厉害了我的国》。跨度多少年？中国成功获得2008年奥运会主办权，成功举办奥运会震撼世界。2021年（注：应该是口误，2001年）不但成功地获得奥运会，中国还拿到了WTO的入门券——签了合同。2008年以后中共领导下的中国集体耍流氓不兑现WTO，集体在奥运会上集体耍流氓——喝兴奋剂。体育强国这个词儿，我们郝海东兄弟、叶钊颖妹妹给了你最明确的答案——就是流氓强国、乱伦强国。但凡要点脸的人都知道那到底儿发生了什么。不是避孕套塞住了下水道，是避孕套塞住了你的精神、塞住了你的良心。

That was all America got after all the wait, the three books – *China Can Say No*,*Unhappy China*and *Amazing China*. How many years were spanned? China won the right to host the 2008 Olympic Games. They hosted the Olympic Games successfully, which shook the world. In 2021 (slip of tongue, should be 2001), China not only won the right to host the Olympics but also obtained the entry ticket to the WTO and signed the agreement. Since 2008, China, as a collective, acted indecently by not fulfilling its promise to the WTO and behaved like hooligans at the Olympic Games by taking stimulants, under the CCP’s leadership. Regarding the title of ‘sports superpower’ [self-claimed by China], our brother Hao Haidong and sister Ye Zhaoying have given you the clearest answer. It [the CCP] is a hooligan superpower and an incest superpower. Anyone that has some sense of shame knows what happened. It is not sewer that was blocked by the condoms [thrown by athletes], it is your spirit and your conscience being blocked by condoms.

某些是正常的，它某些集体做法就不正常。这就是《中国不高兴》、《中国可以说不》到《厉害了，我的国》，从2008年奥运、WTO然后全面渗透，叫国际刑警组织、NGO、世界银行、IWF、世界货币组织、世界贸易组织就彻底被拿下了。比利时的间谍可以跟美国相比，美国大概到8万左右吧现在，大约啊！2017年大约6万左右，现在我估计到8万到10万，在比利时一定也达到这个数在欧盟。

Some were normal, but other collective approaches were not. From *Unhappy China*, *China Can Say No* to *Amazing China*, from the 2008 Olympic Games, the entry to WTO to comprehensive infiltration into the Interpol, NGO, World Bank, IWF and IMF. The WTO was completely infiltrated. The number of spies in Belgium are comparable to that in America. There are about 80,000 in America now, approximately. In 2017, there were around 60,000. Now I think there are 80,000 to 100,000. In Belgium and the EU, the number is definitely in the same range.

就是你让他好了他让你坏，你对他好他对你恶，你对他、你给他、帮他一次，他黏住你要你继续帮，直到你不帮把你干掉和你掐死你为止，这就叫流氓。说到这的时候，中国有贵族吗？中国有多少流氓呢？贵族和流氓的差距就在这儿呢。

You let it prosper, but it sabotages you. You are kind to it, but it does evil deed to you. You helped it once and then it keeps wanting you to help until you stop offering your help and then it will kill you or strangle you. This is called hooliganism. By the way, are there any nobility in China? How many hooligans are there in China? The gap between nobility and hooliganism is clear.
