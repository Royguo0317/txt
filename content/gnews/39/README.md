## 爆料革命战友被共产党迫害的证据
` 喜马拉雅玫瑰园小队` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/807349/)

在2021年1月6日的大选直播中，文贵先生与战友小皮匠针对墙内战友被喝茶的情况展开了探讨。其中提到尽管遭到了国安人员以暴力手段进行的胁迫，但多位战友都拒绝了与国安合作做出诋毁爆料革命的行为。

**Evidence of CCP’s Persecution of BIAs**

**爆料革命战友被共产党迫害的证据**

*(1:22:43-1:24:31)*

**Xiao Pijiang:** Look at this picture. It was attached in a message from a staff member of the MSS of P.R.C. to a brother-in-arms who was asked to drink tea (summoned to have an investigative chat) with them. The BIA (Brothers-in-arms) was asked to comment on GTV to slander the Whistleblower Movement and Mr. Guo, saying that they scammed the hard-earned money out of the Old-Hundred-Names, which means that they (Ministry of State Security) were trying to frame us (Whistleblower Movement).

**小皮匠：**这个图片，这个是国安的一个工作人员,他给被喝茶的一位战友发的信息。说你先去GTV的官方平台上你先去留言，你去骂爆料革命、骂郭先生，说他们骗了老百姓们的血汗钱呀什么什么的，给咱们栽赃陷害。

Next, this BIA was asked to continue to comment on GTV with four other GTV accounts, and to send a screenshot of his comments to the MSS to prove that his task was completed.

接下来又要求这位战友用另外四个GTV的账号继续发言，然后发言之后还得截屏，把这个信息告诉国安的说，你交给我的任务完成了。

Only in this way could the MSS let this BIA pass. This was a nationwide, integrated action, and each victim was forced to cooperate with the government to participate in the so-called “safeguarding of their own rights”. This was purely the consistent style of the CCP, forcing our brothers-in-arms to turn their coats. So sometimes when we see some (Wumao) remarks on GTV, they may be, very likely, from some BIAs who were forced to do that by the MSS.

这样国安才会给战友一个关注啊，并且这是一个全国性的一个整体行动，并且每个受害者都要求必须得配合政府去参与所谓的“维护自身权益”。这纯属于CCP的一贯作风吧，在这儿逼迫着咱们的战友们去做一些反水的活动，所以咱们有时候经常看到在GTV上的一些这样的言论，可能是、非常有可能是国安逼迫做的。

Khaleesi, who sent us this message? At that time, when I saw the messages from some BIAs, to be honest, I didn’t feel shocked anymore. Because I’ve followed the Whistleblower Movement and Uncle Guo for a long time, I felt that they were just a bunch of jerks after seeing the message, but their actions have never exceeded my expectations. Brother Seven might not have been very angry when he saw this picture. Is there something else behind the scenes, Brother Seven? Can you explain some?

卡丽熙，这是哪位战友发上来的信息？当时我看到战友的信息我都，说实话我已经不觉得震撼，因为之前听郭叔之前更长时间的爆料，对这种信息就感觉他们虽然很流氓，但是流氓到几乎都是能想象的程度了。七哥估计看到这个照片的时候也估计不会很生气，七哥在这里边是不是背后还有一些，能不能解释解释？

*(1:28:10-1:31:53)*

**Mr. Miles Guo:** We have a family of brothers-in-arms who are from Guangxi who were asked by the MSS of P.R.C. to drink tea (have an investigative talk) with them. The family has six or seven members. At first it was his daughter who was arrested. The girl supports the Whistleblower Movement. Then his brother was arrested. Later his parents were arrested. And finally his brother’s children were arrested. All of them support the Whistleblower Movement.

**郭先生：**我们有一个战友一家人全是广西的，被国安找去喝茶了。一家六七口口，一开始抓的先是他家的闺女，闺女是支持爆料革命的，后来又把他哥给抓了，后来又把他爸他妈给抓了，然后他哥家的孩子也给抓了，全支持爆料革命的。

I believe you guys know them, they have made many videos for us. The family was forced to act according to the script fabricated by the MSS, such as: how Miles Guo cheated you; how Miles Guo scammed your money. They even forced his daughter to say that she had nude video chats with Miles Guo. But the girl refused, saying that Brother Seven never asked her to do that.

我相信你们知道，还给我们做过很多视频，就这样这一家人家就给编剧本，你怎么说郭文贵骗你的，然后这郭文贵怎么被骗的、骗你钱，还让你闺女脱衣服裸聊，她说我没有啊，七哥没让我这样。

The staff members asked her to read the script that they had written. They spoke with her with a voice changer, and the voice was totally the same as mine. And this BIA told me about something that was too exaggerated and beyond her imagination –that she was secretly video-recorded for a long time. Then they showed her the video and asked her to dub for the video with some words they prepared. These are all too common.

欸，他说你看啊，我们已经编好了，用我的那个变声器，旁边那个人当场说给他听，这边说话跟我一模一样，更让人这个战友告诉我说，夸张到什么程度，她说七哥我都没有想到的事情，我过去我很长时间被他偷录了一段就是个人的视频给放在那里，他说让我跟那段视频然后他说还要配一些话，这都太正常了。

This family was amazing. Truth be told, I’m very unhappy about that. I said that she should have done whatever they asked her to do, but she refused, saying that she can’t do that for the life of her. And finally the MSS gave in. There were too many such stories.

最后这一家战友很了不起的。我说的是实话，我很不高兴，我说他让你干啥你就干啥，结果她坚决不干，七哥你打死我也不能干这事，我们死也不干。最后也就拉倒、不了了之了，就这事太多了。

Do you remember what I exposed three years ago? About one of my bodyguards who returned back home from the U.S. to get married. He was called to the police at night after he finished his work in Zhengquan. He was constantly beaten by the police from as soon as he arrived. He himself was a Chinese wrestling champion and a boxing champion, so he had great resistance, and the policemen were exhausted after beating him. After the abuse, they asked him to film a video, in which he must say that Miles Guo hid in the 18th floor in New York, living in fear every day. He ran to his room after hearing the police siren every time. He often cried in the bathroom. That was what they asked him to say in the video.

我三年前，你记得我爆料吗，就我们一个保镖从美国回去的保镖，是回去结婚去了，被给叫去以后，天天晚上，白天在证泉上班，晚上叫去公安上，进去先打。他本身是中国的摔跤冠军和拳击冠军，他也抗揍，就把揍他的警察累得呼哧带喘，打完以后就是说你看啊，你要配合我录像，郭文贵在纽约啊，在十八楼啊，他天天恐惧，一听到警车就吓到跑到屋里去，一听到警车叫吓得他就躲到屋里去，经常在洗手间哭啊，完了之后让他出来说这段话。

The video took two weeks to make, but nothing was released in the end. It was a policeman on our side who told me this, not the bodyguard. The policeman said that this dude was so strong that he refused for the life of him to work with them. I’ve talked about this in a live broadcast before. It happened three years ago.

就录这录了一俩个星期，但是最后它为啥没给放出来呢。是内部警察告诉了我这个事儿，不是我这个保镖告诉我的。这个警察说你这保镖还真能，打死也不配合，那个保镖打死也没配合他，但是这个警察告诉了我这个事，所以我有一次直播时我讲了，这是三年前的事儿了。

Another thing, in the second half of 2018, the WM-Extermination Task Force summoned more than a dozen Hong Kong celebrities, including Joey Yung and some same-level ones, the ones who had met me before, as well as some older and obsolete stars. They were told that the Anti-WM Group knew they had met Miles Guo before, and they were asked to say that Miles Guo had molested them. Not only that, they were also asked to say that some WM supporters in HK, who have kept in touch with me but you don’t know their names, had molested them. These celebrities truly had balls that they refused for the lives of them to work with the Anti-WM Group, even when they were coerced by the mafia and black police in HK. This was an old story.

另外的就是大概在2018年下半年，“灭爆小组”就香港的那波人找出香港十几个明星啊，明星包括容祖儿都包含里边，那个级别的，容祖儿的还有什么，就是跟我见过面的，还有那年龄稍大的几个人，还有那几个老明星都找出来了。说你们都跟郭文贵见过面我们都了解你们，你们要说出来郭文贵性骚扰你们；然后不但这个，就把香港几个支持咱“爆料革命”的人、你们都不知道的人，一直给我联系的，说这几个人也骚扰你们了。这几个明星还真有点脸，还真有点人性，坚决不干，打死也不干，黑社会逼、警察逼也不干，这都是老菜了。

Today, the MSS will use many tricks. You’ve seen what happened with VOG and the Phoenix Base. You cannot imagine what had happened in last 48 hours. Even I could not have imagined what happened. Yesterday both Lude and our scientist (Dr. Yan) were shocked when they heard it.

今天这个国保这个招儿，这个弄一定会很多，你看VOG、你看凤凰基地发生了什么事情，你不敢想象昨天前48小时发生了啥事儿，你们都不敢想象，就连我都不敢想象，昨天路德听了路德也傻了、科学家也傻了，

My goodness, my brothers and sisters. What your Brother Seven experienced are beyond your imagination. The contributions of many BIAs in the Whistleblower Movement are beyond your imagination. Alright? Thank you!

哎哟，天哪天哪，兄弟姐妹们，你七哥经历的事情，都是你们不敢想象的，爆料革命当中很多战友付出的都是你们不敢想象的。好吧？谢谢，谢谢！
