## 新中国联邦、G-Fashion、GTV和 GNews 是不容忽视的！
` 喜马拉雅玫瑰园小队` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/795932/)

郭先生在2021年1月18日的盖特直播中透露：“GNews，GTV 大家都看到了成为什么，特别现在是美国所谓的各派，这派那派，都要争取依靠的一个平台媒体。说实话我们有些武器还没亮出来呢，GTV，GNews我们会有更多的…好消息. ”

当谈及荣誉、金钱和权力话题时，他强调，如果你被这些所迷恋，那你什么都不是，只要你不站在一定的高度上，你永远都是被渺小的人。

他进而说道：“当你站在历史的前面，和未来不可确定的时间前面，和亿万个、千万个、几十亿个人类面前，谁重要了？什么名被记得？看不懂这个不就无知、无耻、可怜吗？”

**NFSC, G-Fashion, GTV, and GNews Are Non-****ignorable****！**

**新中国联邦、****G-Fashion****、****GTV****和**** GNews ****是不容忽视的！**

Hello, honorable fellow fighters! Today is January 18th. Do you see how I feel? I am wearing my nightwear because I will not work out today. However, from last night till now, I barely had any sleep. I slept four or five times, but each time lasted no more than half an hour. Today I will not work out. Hence, I have started to work since 6:00 am or so. The weather is beautiful today.

尊敬的战友们好！1月18号，天哪，大家看出来我的感觉了吗？穿着睡衣哪，因为我今天不锻炼，不锻炼。但是昨天晚上到现在，基本上没怎么睡觉，基本上没怎么睡觉，睡了四、五次，每次都不超过半小时几乎，今天因为不锻炼，所以说早上从6点多就在下面开始办公了，今天天气特别漂亮。

What I want to tell everyone is that the U.S. President in January 20th…the inauguration of the new President, or the 2021 Presidential Inauguration Ceremony attracts the whole world’s attention. Our friends in Europe and Asia are paying more attention to the presidential election than anyone else, which is unprecedented in the world. The U.S. Presidential Inauguration Ceremony and the CCP virus have thoroughly changed humanity. Now, emerges the New Federal State of China (NFSC).

我想给大家说的事情，随着1月20号美国总统..新总统就职，或者是2021年的美国总统就职仪式，全世界都关注。那么欧洲也好，亚洲也好，咱们的朋友，都比任何人都关注着美国总统大选，可以说让全世界前所未有，一个美国总统的就职仪式，和冠状病毒彻底改变了人类。那么现在又多了一个新中国联邦。

When talking about the CCP virus, you cannot ignore the NFSC. When talking about the future international situation, you cannot ignore the NFSC. More importantly, everyone now has already realized the trend of the world’s economy as well as the trend of world’s entire international and geopolitical security. Year 2021 won’t be peaceful. Now, even the religious community, the unprecedented lurking forces, and the forces from all sides have come forth.

谈中国病毒你不谈新中国联邦不行吧，谈未来的国际形势你不谈新中国联邦不行吧，更重要的事情，大家现在可能是意识到了，世界的经济和世界的整个国际，地缘政治的安全走势，2021年实在是太不平静了。现在就连宗教界，前所未有的潜伏的力量，各方的力量全部都站出来了。

The treatments suffered by the Hong Kongers over the last year, not only will it repeat in the U.S. but also in many other countries. Now is the time that all mankind face with a choice—whether the governments of all mankind becomes the enemy of the people, or the government is indeed for serving the people. A national leader of a European country said, “Miles, you told me a year ago that this day is coming. I believed what you said, but I didn’t think it would happen for certain.” He said its arrival is far beyond the limit that all humans on earth can bear today. The people and governments of their country has realized that people will rebel if the lock down continues for another month or two. Even if people are willing to continue the lock down, can the economy hold up? The economy won’t hold up. This is the situation of the world.

香港人在去年，这一年多遭受的待遇，不仅仅会在美国重演，一定会在很多国家重演，现在到了全人类政府与人民为敌，还是政府真正的是服务于人民，这是人类上全都要面对的选择。欧洲某国的一个国家领导人说：Miles，一年前你告诉我这一天到来，我相信你说的，但我不相信一定会发生。他说今天的到来，远远超出了所有地球人类能承受的这个极限了。他们国家的人民和政府他们感受到，如果再去Lock Down一两个月的话，觉得人民就会造反。即使人民继续Lock Down， 他也说经济能撑住吗？经济也撑不住了，这就是世界的形势。

Brothers and sisters, is it even possible that just one inauguration or the change of one event can make humanity better? Will the problems be solved? Absolutely not! So, brothers and sisters, time has changed and everything has changed. Brothers and sisters, this is not only an opportunity for our NFSC, but also a challenge for us. We need to seize this opportunity, but we will not yield to the challenge. When I heard, saw, and was involved in these big developments related to situation of the humanity as a whole, I indeed hoped all fellow fighters can be like me – experience, know, and cherish all this.

兄弟姐妹们，真不是说一个就职仪式或者说一个事情的变化，人类就变好了吗？问题就解决了吗？绝对不是。所以说兄弟姐妹们，时代真的是变了，一切都变了。兄弟姐妹们，这既是我们新中国联盟的机会，也是我们的挑战，我们要抓住这个机会，但是不能被挑战给挑战没了。当我听到、看到、参与到这些关乎人类世界的大形势发展的时候，我真的希望所有的战友真的能和我一样，经历这一切，知道这一切，珍惜这一切。

The madness of the CCP has already put the mankind into a completely uncertain future. The madness of the CCP is changing the lifestyle, the economy, the religious belief of all mankind, and the old ways of living a life of faith. Fellow fighters who haven’t realized this will suffer. The whole world has now reached a real moment of disaster. Again, the NFSC was born in accordance to the world, assuming the mission given by God. I feel that strongly in every moment. Every fellow fighter has his/her own mission. This feeling is so profound. Every moment I can feel the significance of I (Miles Guo), the NFSC, and the Whistleblower Movement. I hope every fellow fighter can feel it too.

共产党的疯狂已经将人类送上了一个完全不确定的未来，共产党的疯狂正在改变全人类一切的生活方式，全人类的一切的经济方式和全人类对宗教信仰， 一切的过去的信仰生活模式。这个没有意识到的战友们你会吃大亏的，整个世界现在到了一个真的灾难时刻，还是那句话战友们，新中国联邦是应世而生，应运而生。是天赋使命，每时每刻的强烈的感受到了，每个战友都是有使命的人，这个感受太深刻了，我每时每刻都感觉到我郭文贵和新中国联邦、爆料革命的重要性。我更希望每位战友都能感受到。

Yesterday, G-Fashion made such a great success. There was no manipulation or preparation at all, unlike the “11.11” holiday sales in China that needs to prepare for half a year… or the “10.01” holiday (National Day) sales and the alike, they are nothing but nonsense, deceptive, and fake. Our new [G-Fashion] products just hit the market yesterday, and approximately 40% of the products were bought by foreigners. In Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, people cannot buy the products yesterday because of the issues concerning the system and setup, which were solved, partially solved, last night. In Mainland China, people cannot buy the products either because it was midnight. Nevertheless, all the products were sold out. This is truly the force of justice. G-Clubs, I can be legally responsible to say that G-Clubs is almost one of the most special, most valuable, and with the best purchasing power in centuries. Our future G-Coins and G-Dollars must be the best currency in the world. It is a new start of the transformation of the world’s financial system.

昨天的 G-Fashion 竟然是创造真的是这么巨大的，完全没有操作没有准备的。不像国内的光棍节，准备半年，十·一什么节，都胡扯都是骗人的嘛，不真实的。我们昨天就是个新上市，将近一半40%左右是外国人买的，昨天是香港、新加坡地区，台湾地区根本买不了，因为这个系统和设置的问题，到后来昨天晚上才解决了，部分解决。国内根本也是，晚上深夜他也不可能买，就卖空了。这就是一个正义的力量。G-Clubs，我可以今天在这里负法律责任的说，G-Clubs几乎是世界可能几百年来，最特别、最有价值、被购买力最强之一个G-Clubs。 我们未来的G-Coins, G-Dollars那一定是世界上最牛的货币，世界金融系统改造的新开始。

GNews and GTV have become, as everyone can see, a media platform that every faction in the U.S. tries to rely on. To be honest, some of our aces haven’t been revealed yet. With respect to GTV and GNews, we will have more good news. Such a bigshot… I will not participate in any ceremony, I dislike it. Anyone who participates in these ceremonies under the spotlight and likes to sit there and give a performance must be lacking self-confidence. People who show off a bunch of photos taken together with celebrities and officials in their house must be an insecure person. You are who you are. Why do you use others to prove yourself? Why do you only realize the importance of yourself by attending ceremonies? There is no ceremony in the world never to be forgotten, and there is no ceremony in the world which is absolutely the greatest because some may like it while others may not. If you don’t even have this basic common sense, aren’t you a lost cause?

GNews，GTV 大家都看到了成为什么，特别现在是美国所谓的各派，这派那派，都要争取依靠的一个平台媒体。说实话我们有些武器还没亮出来呢，GTV，GNews我们会有更多的…好消息..乖乖…这么大人物…我才不参加这仪式那仪式，讨厌。凡是一个往镁光灯下参加这仪式那仪式的人，要坐在那要表现表现，他一定是他没有自信的，家里面放着一堆名人照片，跟这个那个领导的照片，他一定是个不自信的人。你就有你自己，你干嘛拿别人证明你自己呀？干嘛要通过参加仪式觉得自己重要？世界上没有一个不会忘记的仪式，世界上没有一个绝对牛的仪式，有喜欢的有不喜欢的，这点起码的常识、境界都没有，那不就完蛋了嘛。

Just like what an old friend from Vatican told me yesterday. He said, “Miles, we have known each other for more than a decade. There is no one quite like you, who doesn’t take a few photos with someone or record a video when visiting Vatican. You never do that and refuse to do that all the time. I feel like you are eccentric.” He said, now, he understands me. When I went to Vatican, he said I can take photos with anyone I wanted. I didn’t do it. What’s the point? A couple of days ago someone told me, “Miles, you are comparable with this famous person. You can match him.” I just smiled a little. He underestimated me. This is because if you are only obsessed with honor, money, and power, you are nobody. If you do not stand high enough with broader perspective, you will always be seen as nobody.

就像昨天凡蒂冈的一位咱们的老哥儿们给我说的，他说：Miles，我跟你认识十几年，没有任何人像你一样到了凡蒂冈不跟谁照几张相啊，录个像啊，从来没有，都拒绝，我觉得你这个是怪人，他说现在我真的理解你了。我去凡蒂冈，你说：我想跟谁照都行。不照！凭啥啊？头两天有一个人跟我说，文贵你跟谁谁谁可以并比了，可以并列了。我当时笑一笑，也太看不起郭文贵了，因为但凡你对荣誉、金钱和权力迷恋的人，你什么都不是，只要你不站在一定的高度上，你永远都是被渺小的人。

If you cannot figure it out or understand, it is because the altitude you stand on is too low, not high enough. When standing in front of history, in front of the uncertainty of the future, and in front of hundreds of millions or billions of human beings, who do you think was important? Who have been remembered? Are those who cannot figure this out just ignorant, shameless, and pathetic?

你看不懂、听不懂，是因为你站位太低，你站的不够高。当你站在历史的前面，和未来不可确定的时间前面，和亿万个、千万个、几十亿个人类面前，谁重要了？什么名被记得？看不懂这个不就无知、无耻、可怜吗？

Okay, that’s all. Today I will not work out and will have a rest. Not working out and having a rest makes me feel comfortable on some days and not so on other days. Good habits are very important. Brothers and sisters, everything has just begun!

行了，我就不说了，今天不锻炼，休息休息。不锻炼休息休息有时候舒服，有时候不舒服，好习惯很重要，亲爱的兄弟姐妹们，一切都是刚刚开始！
