司法部长威廉·巴尔在周一发布的备忘录中，授权司法部（DOJ）调查2020年总统大选的投票违规行为。

备忘录已由Barr致函并签署给美国检察官，美国司法部刑事司，民权司，国家安全司助理检察长，以及联邦调查局（FBI）局长克里斯托弗·雷（Christopher Wray）。

备忘录中写道：“现在投票已经结束，当务之急是美国人民可以相信我们的选举以这样的方式进行，即选举结果能准确反映选民的意愿。”

巴尔的备忘录是在39名众议院共和党人周五在一封信中敦促巴尔让美国司法部可用资源调查全国几个主要战场州投票不当行为的指控之后的。特朗普竞选活动在其中一些州提起了许多诉讼。

巴尔在备忘录中说，尽管各州负有进行和监督选举的主要责任，但司法部“有义务确保以这种方式进行联邦选举，以使美国人民对其选举过程和对他们的政府充满信心。”

他补充说，尽管所谓的“多数指控”涉及选举不当行为，其规模如此之大，以至于不会影响选举结果，因此可以推迟进行调查，“并非总是如此。”

他说，由于投票已经结束，因此对司法部在这种情况下采取的公开行动大大减少的担忧。

他还说，他已经授权司法部对具体情况下的投票和投票制表不当行为提出重大指控。

“鉴于此，并且鉴于我们当前的选举已经结束，我授权您在某些情况下在您的辖区进行选举之前对大量的投票指控和制表不当行为进行指控，就像我在特定情况下所做的那样，“ 他说。

他说，如果存在明显的，显然可信的违规指控，可能会进行查询和审查，这些指控如果属实，可能会影响单个州联邦选举的结果。

他说：“虽然美国检察官保持其固有的权力，可以进行适当的调查和调查，但在进行任何与选举有关的事项作为初步调查时，可能会比较谨慎，以评估现有证据是否值得采取进一步的调查步骤。” 。

他还敦促美国司法部采取“极为谨慎和判断”的态度，不要对“似是而非的，投机性的，虚构的或牵强附会的要求进行询问”。

他指出，他的调查授权不应该表示司法部已得出结论，投票违规行为已影响选举结果，而是要确保对投票过程的信任。

他说：“我提供这种权威和指导，以强调必须及时，妥善处理有关选举不当行为的指控，以便所有美国人民，无论其偏爱的候选人或政党如何，都对我们的选举结果充满信心。” 。

他说：“美国人民和他们自由选举产生的领导人应得的就是更多。”

Attorney General William Barr Authorizes DOJ to Look into Voting Irregularities

Attorney General William Barr in a memo issued on Monday authorized the Justice Department (DOJ) to look into voting irregularities in the 2020 presidential election.

The memo was addressed and signed from Barr to U.S. Attorneys, the assistant attorneys general for the DOJ’s criminal division, civil rights division, the national security division, and the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Christopher Wray.

“Now that the voting has concluded, it is imperative that the American people can trust that our elections were conducted in such a way that the outcomes accurately reflect the will of the voters,” the memo read.

Barr’s memo comes after 39 House Republicans pressed Barr in a letter on Friday to allow available DOJ resources to look into allegations of voting irregularities across the country in several key battleground states. The Trump campaign has filed a number of lawsuits in some of those states.

Barr said in his memo that, although the states have the primary responsibility to conduct and supervise elections, the DOJ has “an obligation to ensure that federal elections are conducted in such a way that the American people can have full confidence in their electoral process and their government.”

He added that while “most allegations” of purported election misconduct are of such a scale that they would not impact the outcome of an election that their investigation can be deferred, “that is not always the case.”

He said concerns that overt actions taken by the DOJ in this case are greatly minimized, since the voting has concluded.

He also said he has already authorized the DOJ to pursue substantial allegations of voting and voting tabulation irregularities in specific instances.

“Given this, and given that voting in our current elections has now concluded, I authorize you to pursue substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities prior to the certification of elections in your jurisdictions in certain cases, as I have already done in specific instances,” he said.

He said inquiries and reviews may be conducted if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual state.

“While U.S. Attorneys maintain their inherent authority to conduct inquiries and investigations as they deem appropriate, it will likely be prudent to commence any election-related matters as a preliminary inquiry, so as to assess whether available evidence warrants further investigative steps,” he said.

He also urged for the DOJ to exercise “great care and judgment’ and not launch inquiries on “specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims.”

He noted that his authorization of investigations should not be taken as an indication that the DOJ has concluded that voting irregularities have impacted the outcome of the election, but to ensure trust in the voting process.

“I provide this authority and guidance to emphasize the need to timely and appropriately address allegations of voting irregularities so that all of the American people, regardless of their preferred candidate or party, can have full confidence in the results of our elections,” he said.

“The American people and the leaders they freely elect deserve nothing less,” he said.
