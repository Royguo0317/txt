**中共把社交媒体当成跟西方战争的第一武器**

**The CCP Deems Social Media as Its No. 1 Weapon in Fighting Against the West**

七哥在一年前，我在船上接受战斗室直播的采访，还有那个那个很多媒体问我，共产党,（我是第一个告诉西方的在几年前，）共产党最早国家安全委员会成立安全部，从江时代后期就定义为社交媒体是跟西方作战斗争的第一武器，远远重要于核武器。

A year ago, I, your Brother Miles, was interviewed live by the War Room on the yacht, and many media also asked me [this same question]. I was the first one to tell the West, a few years back, that the CCP’s National Security Council established the Ministry of Security and it deemed the social media as their number one weapon in its fight against the West, even more important than nuclear weapons, early as the late Jiang Zemin era.

这就是为什么搞孔子学院，孔子学院的第一个人、发起人是谁知道吗？是当时北京市政府的教委主任、姓耿的一位耿主任。这位耿主任后来跟我很好很熟，我还让他帮我送了北京电影学院几个小孩啊，小女孩很漂亮，朋友的孩子送进去，现在都成名了，电影学院啊送进去。教委主任权力很大啊。他给我介绍了一堆的中纪委、中央委员跟我认识，那教委的主任很有权力呀，是他发起的。发起当时北京市教委主任发起，发起这个时候是国家安全部、统战部、总参二部一起作为发起人，你说它[孔子学院]是干啥的？

So who knows the name of the first person who initiated the Confucius Institute? It was a director of the Education Commission of the Beijing City Government, named Geng. Director Geng later became very familiar with me, and I asked him/her to help send a few kids to the Beijing Film Academy. They were my friends’ girls, very pretty. Now they are all famous. [We] sent them to the film academy. The director of Education Commission had a lot of power. He hooked me up with a bunch of members of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Central Committee of the CCP. So the Director of the Education Commission is a very powerful person, and it was him who initiated it [the Confucius Institute]. It was co-founded by the Beijing Municipal Education Commission, together with the Ministry of National Security, the United Front Work Department, and the [PLA’s] General Staff Department, the 2nd Bureau. So you tell me what kind of place Confucius Institute really is?

然后当时百度、包括阿里巴巴、微信，所有的技术指导是总参三部，所有的是国家安全部。到后来抖音、Zoom全是国家安全委员会全面控制。这是为什么像多维呀，这种基地都在北京的，是共产党的宣传媒体、情报媒体，获取情报的。所以说这个基本的常识，这是共产党作为核武器来用的，你还相信他来给你带来正义？

Also, all the technical guidance for Baidu, Alibaba, and WeChat was from the 3rd Bureau of the PLA’s General Staff Department, and all were under the supervision of the Ministry of National Security. Later, TikTok and Zoom got fully controlled by the National Security Council. This is why things like Duowei News are based in Beijing because they are the CCP’s propaganda media and intelligence media aiming for collecting information. So it is a common sense that it [the media] is used by the CCP as a nuclear weapon. Do you still believe that it [the media] will bring you any justice?

在美国是更可怕了，那美国扎克伯格、推特，中国…现在看到后面这几十个股东里面现在已经很可怕的。我今天告诉大家，四年前的419的时候，共产党是用政治新闻、广告新闻、或者蓝金黄新闻，来影响和打击他的敌人。但是到今年[有了]本质上的不同，共产党已用国家的已经是叫做什么？真正的共产党的国家力量已经成为了“武器新闻”。武器新闻——推特、Facebook、Google、Zoom、抖音、香港所有的媒体、微信、百度，全面控制。 你看共产党有多危险，你就看媒体你就知道了。

It’s even more terrifying in the United States. Look at Zuckerberg and Twitter in the United State. China… it’s already very terrifying when you see the dozens of shareholders behind the scene. Today, let me tell you that four years ago (April 19, 2017), the CCP used political news, advertisement news, or BGY’ed news to influence and attack its enemies. But this year, things have changed fundamentally. What they are really doing is to use its national power to weaponize news. The weaponized news media, including Twitter, Facebook, Google, Zoom, TikTok, all the media in Hong Kong, WeChat, Baidu, are all under its control. So if you want to know how dangerous the CCP is, you just look at the media.

世界的媒体在这短短的四年里，被共产党已经用金钱合法控制。也就是说沼泽地，世界的沼泽地，以犹太人为主的金融力量和媒体力量控制着世界，控制着美国，现在有另外一股力量，那就是中国共产党。

In these short four years, the world’s media has been legally controlled by the CCP with money. In other words, the swampland, the swampland of the world, where Jewish the people dominated  financial and media forces used to control the world and control the United States, have now been joined by another force – the Chinese Communist Party.

今天可怕的事情， 这些媒体的力量已经不是美国一家说了算，共产党在利用这些媒体，正在干着新疆大屠杀、西藏大陷害、香港大屠杀、台湾大恐惧，都在被媒体有选择地屏蔽掉，这才是可怕的。

What’s really terrifying today is that the US is no longer the only power behind the media. The CCP is using the media to mask its Xinjiang Massacre, the Tibet Massacre, the Hong Kong Massacre, and the Taiwan Terror. These things are all being selectively blocked by the media. And this is terrifying!
