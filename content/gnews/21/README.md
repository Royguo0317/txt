**摘要：在2021年5月21日的盖特视频中，郭先生说中共挑拨俄罗斯和美国的关系，然后他的一位俄罗斯内部的朋友说，俄罗斯只想利用中共，普京不会做给中共做实际的事情。中共还借着巴以冲突公然挑衅犹太人，中共14亿老百姓如果跟着共产党走，会死无葬身之地。他呼吁：“中国同胞醒来吧，醒来吧！”**

**中共挑拨美俄关系  挑起巴以冲突  绑架14亿人民与犹太人为敌**

**The CCP Incites Countries to Fight Against Each Other and Invokes Hatred and Discrimination Toward Jewish People**

大家都看到了世界的形势，可以说是每时每刻都在以历史上前所未有的巨变的速度在变化中，无论是地缘政治、军事格局，还是一个热点冲突，还是能源，还有一个整个的资本的流动，都在剧烈的变化中。

We have all seen that the world, so to speak, is changing at a historically unprecedented rate every moment. Whether it is geopolitics, the military landscape, a hotspot conflict, or energy, or the overall capital flow, are all in the midst of dramatic changes.

大家也能看到，现在老共使劲儿挑拨俄罗斯和美国的关系，你看他就是烂招儿。他们想学英国人在历史上挑拨离间，分化，是吧，然后分离，让你内斗，这个差太远了，共产党就是 low 到不能再 low 了。

As you can see, now the CCP is trying hard to provoke the relationship between Russia and the United States. You can see that it is a bad move – they want to learn from the British in the past to alienate the two countries and incite one against the other, right? And then to cause them to turn away from each other and fight against each other. It (the CCP) is very far [from being successful]. The CCP is so low that you can’t imagine how it could go any lower.

结果是俄罗斯的内部，咱们的朋友就说，他说：“我们就想在中国弄些钱，知道他们完蛋了，就想多弄点钱，再一个把历史上未确定的事情，我们确定下来。不就是口头承诺嘛。”他说现在共产党跟我们玩什么？想玩让我们和美国人斗，他说那是不可能的。人家普京也很聪明，你让我喊两嗓子，我就喊两嗓子，是吧，但是实际的事是不可能。但是国内的这些小粉红们，愚蠢到自娱自乐，愚蠢的“愚”自娱自乐的程度，然后就这么疯狂。

Well, our friend, who is an insider of Russia, said, “We (the Russians) just want to get some money from China. Knowing that they will be finished soon, we just want to squeeze more money from them. And also we need to get some undetermined historical issues resolved. Isn’t it just an oral contract? ” He said, “What the CCP is playing with us now is to trick us to fight with the Americans. That is impossible.” Putin is very smart, knowing that you (the CCP) let me shout out loud for you, so I will do that for you, which is fine, but doing anything concrete is impossible. However, those “little pinks” (young cyber-nationalists in China) are so stupid to the extent of self-indulgence and even fooling themselves by celebrating all this. So crazy!

世界的风向不是在变，[而是]世界的民心在凝聚，世界的人心在凝聚和所谓的风向在改变是两个概念。连巴勒斯坦，巴以战争在历史上那么多次冲突，这次最重要的最危险的冲突当中，犹太人第一次在犹太人的社区里面，和犹太社会圈里面提出来，这个背后的黑手就是伊朗，就是中国共产党。第一次犹太种族得到了公开的共产党的羞辱和歧视和攻击。

The world is NOT just switching gears, rather people’s hearts are getting united. Switching gears and getting united are two different concepts. Look at Palestine. Palestine and Israel had so many conflicts in history. During the recent conflict, which is the most important and most dangerous one, the Jewish people for the first time raised the point in the Jewish community and the Jewish social circle that Iran and the Chinese Communist Party were behind all this. For the first time, the Jewish people were openly humiliated, discriminated against and attacked by the CCP.

共产党绑架了14亿中国人民，要与用犹太人为敌，然后共产党要把这个种族的矛盾和歧视犹太人，种族歧视和种族蔑视，把科学化、知识化、历史化、政治化、经济化，然后把它给种族政治战争化。

The CCP has kidnapped 1.4 billion Chinese people to be enemies of the Jews. And then the CCP wanted to make this racial conflict and discrimination against the Jews, the racial discrimination and racial contempt to become a scientific, intellectual, historical, political and economic issue, and lead it to a racial, political war.

大家想想可怕不？就是中国人如果你再跟着共产党，你不是走进火葬场，你连走进火葬场的机会都没有。看到巴勒斯坦的那些将领了吗？看到伊朗的那些将领，怎么被被斩首的吗？就是你跟着共产党，你都不知道咋回事，就上面“叭唧”就把你切成肉泥了，那个肉不都在车里面，不知道嘣哪去了，可能被人野狗吃了都有可能，你想去火葬场都不可能。这是共产党给中国人带来最大的威胁，洗你的脑，要你的钱，要你的生殖器，给你搞双修，都不算事儿，这是每天在发生的。要了你的命，还要让你天天替他高兴，然后你还要连进火葬场的机会都没有。真的，中国同胞醒来吧，醒来吧。

Is it scary? If you still follow the CCP,  you will not “walk” into a crematorium (meaning die with the CCP), because you will not even have the chance to “walk” into a crematorium. Did you see the generals in Palestine? Did you see how the generals in Iran were diced into pieces before knowing it? If you follow the CCP, your flesh will be iced into pieces without knowing it, and not all the flesh would be found in the car, some pieces might not be located and could be eaten by wild dogs, so there wouldn’t be a chance for your body to go to a crematorium. This is the biggest threat that the CCP brings to the Chinese people. Washing your brain, demanding your money, controlling your genitals, or having sex with you, is nothing compared to that, for those are happening every day. It will take your life, but it asks you to feel happy for it every day, and you don’t even have the chance to go to the crematorium. Seriously, wake up, my Chinese compatriots!
