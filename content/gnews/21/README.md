## Introduction

## 引言

Volume 1 of the Navarro Report, The Immaculate Deception, assessed the fairness and integrity of the 2020 Presidential Election by identifying and assessing six key dimensions of alleged election irregularities. These irregularities included: outright fraud, ballot mishandling, a wide range of process fouls, multiple violations of the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, voting machine irregularities, and statistical anomalies.

纳瓦罗报告的第一卷“完美骗局”从六个关键的选举违规行为维度，认定和评估了2020年总统选举的公平性和公正性。这些行为包括：彻底的欺诈、选票处理不当、大范围的程序违规、多次违反第14条修正案的平等保护条款、投票机违规以及统计数据异常。

This assessment was conducted across six key battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. It would be the outcomes in these six states that would ultimately be election-determinate – just as the strategy of the Democrat Party assumed.

这项评估是在六个关键战场州 – 亚利桑那州，佐治亚州，密歇根州，内华达州，宾夕法尼亚州和威斯康辛州进行的。这六个州的选举结果将最终决定大选的选举结果 – 正如民主党竞选策略所设想的那样。

Evidence used to conduct The Immaculate Deception assessment included more than 50 lawsuits and judicial rulings, thousands of affidavits and declarations, testimony in a variety of state venues, published analyses by think tanks and legal centers, videos and photos, public comments, and extensive press coverage. Three key findings of the report include: (1) Six types of election irregularities were present and pervasive in most or all of the battleground states; (2) Each battleground state differed in its own way with respect to the types of irregularities that were election-determinate; (3) There was no single “silver bullet” that allegedly won the election for Biden; instead it was “death by a thousand irregularities” in any given battleground state; and, most importantly with respect to the question as to whether the election may well have been stolen, (4) the narrow alleged Biden “victory” margins in each of the six battleground states were dwarfed by the number of potentially illegal ballots.

用于支撑“完美骗局”报告的证据包括超过50项诉讼和司法裁决、数千份宣誓书和声明、在各种官方场合的证词、公布于智库和法律中心的分析、视频和照片、公众评论以及广泛的新闻报道。报告的三个主要发现包括：（1）六种类型的选举违规现象普遍存在于大多数或所有的战场州；（2）每个战场州在可以决定选举结果的违规行为的类型上有其不同之处；（3）并不存在于一种“高招”来所谓的帮拜登获得选举胜利；相反，在任何一个特定的战场州，最重要的是，关于选举是否很可能被盗这一问题的答案是：“违规行为正如战场上的上千种死法”；（4）在所有六个战场州，拜登所谓的“胜利”的微弱优势是被潜在的非法选票数量（将川普总统的优势）抵消的。

Volume 2 of the Navarro Report, The Art of the Steal, examined the institutional genesis of the six types of election irregularities. One key finding: The Democrat Party efforts to strategically game the election process across the six battleground states began years before, and in many cases, shortly after President Trump was elected in 2016. A second key finding: the Democrat’s This gaming of the election process was implemented through a two-pronged Grand “Stuff the Ballot Box” Strategy designed to flood the six key battleground states with enough un-scrutinized and potentially illegal absentee and mail-in ballots to turn a decisive Trump victory into a narrow alleged Biden “win.”

纳瓦罗报告的第二卷“偷窃的艺术”分析了六种选举违规行为的制度成因。一个关键的发现是：民主党在六个战场州的选举过程中策略性的玩弄大选的企图与努力，早在川普总统2016年当选后不久就开始了，而且在很多情况下是在那之后不久。第二个重要发现：民主党这种玩弄选举的过程是通过双管齐下的“填塞投票箱”的战略设计，使足够多的未审查和潜在的非法缺席选票和邮寄选票泛滥于六个战场州，从而将川普总统决定性的胜利变成了所谓的拜登的微弱的“胜利”。

Prong One of the Democrat strategy dramatically INCREASED the amount of absentee and mail-in ballots. Prong Two dramatically DECREASED the level of scrutiny of such ballots. This resulted in a FLOOD of potentially illegal ballots into the battleground states more than sufficient to tip the scales from a decisive legal win by President Trump to a narrow and potentially illegitimate alleged “victory” by Joe Biden.

民主党战略的第一个策略是大幅度**增加**缺席选票和邮寄选票的数量。第二策略是大幅度**减少**对此类投票的审查水平。这导致大量潜在的非法选票涌入战场州，数量充足到可以扭转局面，使得川普总统具有法律效应的决定性胜利，倒向了乔·拜登（Joe Biden）所谓的微弱且可能非法的“胜利”。

Importantly, much of what the Democrat Party and its operatives did to effectively achieve what may well be an illegal result was pursued through a variety of legal means. Nonetheless, at times, Democrat government officials also bent, and at times, broke the laws or rules of their state.

重要的是，民主党及其工作人员为有效实现很有可能是非法的结果所做的事情，都是通过各种合法手段来实现的。尽管如此，民主党政府有时也会扭曲，并有时会违犯他们州的法律或规则。

Volume 3 of the Navarro Report is designed to serve as a capstone to what has been a comprehensive analysis of the question: Was the 2020 presidential election stolen from Donald J. Trump? In this report, we provide the most up-to-date statistical “receipts” with respect to the potential number of illegal votes in each battleground state.

纳瓦罗报告的第三卷被设计成一个“顶石”，作为一个对这个问题的综合分析：2020年的总统大选是不是被从唐纳德·J·川普（Donald J. Trump）那里偷走了？在这份报告中，我们提供了有关每个战场州潜在非法选票数量的最新数据统计的“收据”。

The broader goal of this final installment of the Navarro Report is to provide investigators with a well-documented tally of potentially illegal votes on a state-by-state and category-by-category basis. This tally is presented in Figure One on the next page of this report. Note that each number in this figure has a corresponding endnote identifying the source of the number. Note further that we have taken a conservative approach to the count of potentially illegal ballots.

纳瓦罗报告的最后一部分的更广泛的目标，是为调查人员提供详细记录的潜在非法选票的统计信息，这些统计信息是按州和按类别进行的。此统计信息显示在本报告下一页的图1中。 请注意，此图中的每个数字都有一个相应的尾注，用于标识数字的来源。 还要注意，我们对可能的非法选票计数采取了保守的方法。

As with previous volumes of the Navarro Report, you can see clearly in Figure One that the number of potentially illegal votes dwarfs the very thin alleged Biden “victory” margins. In the face of this evidence, no reasonable person would conclude that the 2020 presidential election was, beyond any shadow of doubt, a fair election. Rather, anyone who reads this report should feel compelled to seek greater clarity about whether, in fact, this election may have been stolen from Donald J. Trump.

与《纳瓦罗报告》的前几卷一样，您可以在图一中清楚地看到，潜在的非法选票数量，使所谓的拜登“胜出”的选票优势微不足道。 面对这些证据，有理性的人显然不可能得出结论说，2020年总统选举无疑是一场公正的选举。而且，任何阅读本报告的人，都理应迫切寻求更多的真相以了解是否这次选举被从唐纳德·J·川普那里盗走了。

While it is now politically correct in progressive circles and the mainstream media to demand that all Americans submit and confess to the “truth” of what may well be the fiction of a free and fair election for the sake of “unity” and “harmony,” such a Kafkaesque demand in the face of the evidence in this report will likely have the opposite effect.

虽然现在应进步派圈子和主流媒体政治正确的要求，所有美国人都为“团结”和“和谐”而屈从于“真相”，所谓自由公正的选举很可能都是虚构的。面对这份报告中的证据，这种变态妄想式的要求可能会产生相反的效果。

To wit: almost half the country now believes that there were significant irregularities in the 2020 presidential race; and the failure to fully investigate these irregularities will only increase the number of Americans who have such doubts.

就是说：现在这个国家几乎一半的人，认为2020年总统大选存在重大违规行为； 未能全面调查这些违规行为，只会增加对此表示怀疑的美国人数量。

This will be particularly true if the suppression of what necessarily must be a search for truth is facilitated by the authoritarian – nay fascist – behavior of a small group of social media oligarchs who have taken it upon themselves to de-platform and censor tens of millions of pro-Trump Americans who now find themselves victims, rather than consumers, of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

如果一小撮社交媒体寡头的独裁者（即法西斯主义者）的行为，压制了数千万人的平台，并对其进行审查，寻求真理的行为被以专制的手段压制，就尤其如此。亲川普的美国人，现在发现自己成为Facebook，Twitter和YouTube等平台的受害者，而不是消费者。

In considering these truths, let us never forget two things: (1) The Democrat Party and its operatives stole the 1960 Presidential Election – it happened then and it can happen again; and (2) it took decades for historians to finally acknowledge the 1960 version of the Immaculate Deception in the face of the same kind of virtue-signaling and cancel culture pressures we are witnessing today.

在考虑这些事实时，让我们永远不要忘记两件事：（1）民主党及其代理人偷走了1960年的总统选举–当时发生了，以后可能再次发生。（2）历史学家花了数十年的时间才最终直面1960年的完美欺骗，与我们今天目睹的一致，打着所谓（政治正确的）美德信号和消除文化压力的幌子。

Despite a similar quest to silence Republican and conservative voices today, 74 million Americans who voted for President Donald J. Trump have the right to a full investigation and bipartisan search for truth. If, however, the Democrat Party, RINO elements of the Republican Party, the anti-Trump mainstream media, and the out-of-control censoring social media oligarchs do not cease and desist from their efforts to suppress the search for truth about the 2020 election, history will judge all of these people, corporations, and institutions in the harshest possible manner.

尽管今天同样有类似的寻求使共和党和保守派消声的要求，但投票支持唐纳德·J·川普总统的7400万美国人，仍然有要求选举接受全面调查、两党共同寻求真相的权利。 但是，如果民主党，共和党的RINO分子，反川普的主流媒体以及失控的审查性社交媒体寡头，没有停止作恶，并放弃压制寻求2020年真相的努力，那么对于2020大选，历史将以最严厉的方式来评判所有这些人，公司和机构。

At this point, we have moved dangerously in what seems like a nanosecond from a full and vibrant American Democracy to a Communist Chinese-style, Cancel Culture, Police State guarded by a collusive social media oligopoly that is beyond out of control.

In the remainder of this report, we will simply present the statistical “receipts” on a state-by-state and subcategory-by-subcategory basis what may well be the worst theft in American political history. If the U.S. Congress and State Legislatures across the six battleground states ignore this evidence, they will do so not just at their own peril but also at the peril of America’s faith in our elections and the sanctity of our Republic.

现在，我们几乎是花费了一纳秒，就从一个完整、充满活力的美式民主转变为由完全失控的社交媒体寡头合谋垄断所保护的共产中国式、消灭文化的，警察国家。在本报告的其余部分，我们将简单地按照州和子类别的方式，列出统计“收据”，这很可能是美国政治史上最严重的盗窃案。 如果美国国会和六个战场州立法机关无视这些证据，那么他们的所作所为，不仅将自担风险，而且也将损害美国人民对选举和我们的共和国神圣性的信念。
