英語標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep 208: The Three Gorges Dam discharged the floods with ten sluice gates

視頻重點

1. 長江2020年第5號洪水，今日過重慶。這是1981年來重慶經歷的最大一次洪水。近期重慶滴雨未下，水位卻只增不減，本次洪災是因為上游放水、下游關水所致。長江流域有5萬座水庫，重慶這場洪水不是天災而是中共治下的人禍！
2. 建造時號稱能抵禦萬年水災的三峽大壩，在8月19日7:30，首次十孔同時洩洪，下游岌岌可危。
3. 隨著CCP內鬥的加劇，8月18日中糧集團领导骆家駹和上海市要员被中纪委调查。
4. 美驅逐艦馬斯廷號8月18日通過台灣海峽，這是美軍今年第八度派艦隊來台海巡航，最特別的是，此次美艦航行海峽中線以西，接近中國海岸線航行，中共國解放軍雷聲大雨點小，只能跟監美艦。
5. (郭文貴先生，8/19）中共的病毒，得有人調查才行，還有立法。還有呢？戰友們想想，什麼情況下，我們的英雄科學家能改變世界的遊戲規則？能成為爆料革命、新中國聯邦砸向共產黨的重錘？有點耐心。我們的英雄科學家絕對是天使。你們會懂的。


1. The No.5 flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 passed through Chongqing City today, which was the biggest flood ever recorded since 1981.  There has been no rainfall recently in Chongqing, however, the water stage keeps rising. This flood disaster was likely caused by the release of water from upstream reservoirs and simutaneous closure of downstream reservoirs.
2. The CCP falsely claimed that the Three Gorges Dam was able to withstand the largest flood in tens of thousands of years at the time of being built.  At 7:30 on August 19, for the first time, this dam discharged the floods with ten of its sluice gates, which put peoples along the downstream at risk.
3. As a result of the infights of the CCP, on August 18, Luo Jiazhen, chief accountant of China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation, and other Shanghai CCP officials were investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CCP.
4. Destroyer USS Mustin Transited Taiwan Strait on August 18. This is the 8th time the U.S. military fleet deployed across the Taiwan Strait this year, and the most special fact is that the destroyer sailed by the west side of the strait center line, which is closer to the Chinese coastline, while the PLA did nothing but monitored and followed the U.S. fleet.
5. (Miles Guo, August 19) Someone must start investigations as well as legislations. And, what else? My friends, think about it. Under what circumstances can our hero scientist change the world’s rule of play? And become a haymaker of the Whistleblower Movement and the New Federal State of China to hammer the CCP with? Be patient. You will understand that, our hero scientist is definitely an angel.
