英語標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep 205:  U.S. push to deny the CCP regime’s legitimacy

視頻重點

1. 近日大陸多家銀行以反洗錢為名凍結儲蓄卡。更有官媒以中共發展為由，提議強制徵收生育基金。眾所周知中共權貴階層是最大的洗錢組織，中共權貴階層們把香港作為洗錢的中轉站、跳板，然後再將資產轉移國外，幾乎全部權貴家族都這樣運作。肆意無故凍結百姓的儲蓄卡，實屬非法政府行為。
2. 大陸各地為響應中共節約號召，多舉措反對浪費，甚至洗腦百姓日常生活，讓家長懲罰剩飯子女。似乎回到文革相互監督的時代。
3. 四川綿陽同樣遭水災，百姓生活遇困難。另有四川綿陽也連降暴雨，積水嚴重，百姓損失不可估量。看不到政府的救援在哪？每年徵收的稅費用在哪裡？
4. （澳大利亞和美國政府前網絡安全合同商Robert Potter，澳大利亞天空新聞，8月16日）（從這個資料庫）我們開始看到之前在新疆和西藏廣泛部署的監控技術，現在以不同的規模部署到中共國其他地方。 但在我們查看了原資料之後，很明顯，這是一個建築物門禁系統，用政府的面部識別系統來驗證居民進入自己家的權限。
5. （Miles Guo. 8月13日）在歐洲，沒想到啊，聽說這個美國推廣的，否定中共的政權的合法性，一致得到同意。那麼現在大家都在想，那你美國，共產黨不合法誰合法啊？


1. Banks in mainland China froze debit cards under the pretext of anti-money laundering. Moreover, official media advocated for the compulsory collection of maternity funds, citing Communist China’s development as the reason.  It’s well known that the CCP’s powerful class is the largest money laundering organization. They use Hong Kong as a transfer station and springboard for money laundering, and then transfer assets abroad. Almost all powerful families operate in this way.
2. In response to the CCP’s call to save food, many areas took measures to curb food wasting. They went so far as to brainwash the people, asking parents to punish children for wasting food. This seems backing to the era of the Cultural Revolution when the people surveilled one another.
3. Mianyang in Sichuan was also flooded, causing hardship to people’s life. Mianyang was also severely flooded because of the heavy rain. The people suffered immeasurable losses. The government’s rescue is nowhere to be seen. So, what is the use of taxes collected each year?
4. (Robert Potter, former Australian and U.S. government cyber security contractor) We’re now starting to see (from this database) technologies which had previously been deployed extensively in Xinjiang and Tibet, now being deployed elsewhere within China at a different scale, after we went through the metadata, it became clear that this was a building access management system where people, where state government facial recognition systems were being used to authenticate people’s access to their own homes.
5. (Miles Guo. August 13) Right now, out of one’s expectation,  I heard the U.S.’ push to deny the CCP regime’s legitimacy has gained unanimous agreement in Europe. Then everyone wondered, if the U.S. deems the CCP regime illegitimate, which regime would be legitimate (to represent the Chinese people)?
