### **總統關於與波蘭共和國增強國防合作協議的聲明**

Issued on: August 15, 2020

發佈日期：2020年8月15日

Today, my Administration signed a historic Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the Republic of Poland.  This agreement is the culmination of months of negotiations with our Polish allies following the two joint declarations I signed with President Duda last year.  The agreement will enhance our military cooperation and increase the United States military presence in Poland to further strengthen NATO deterrence, bolster European security, and help ensure democracy, freedom, and sovereignty.

今天，我國政府與波蘭共和國簽署一項歷史性的增強國防合作協議。去年我與杜達總統簽署了兩項聯合聲明後，此該協議是與波蘭盟國進行數月談判的累積。該項協議能增強雙方軍隊合作和增加美國在波蘭的軍事儲備，以進一步加深北約的震懾力，增強歐洲安全，並有助於確保維護民主、自由與主權。

My Administration has done more for the United States Armed Forces than any other in history, including entirely rebuilding our military.  This agreement is yet another in a series of actions that will protect our forces and increase their ability to carry out their mission.  Additionally, this agreement serves as a model for other nations with respect to equitable burden sharing.  I thank President Duda, the Polish people, and the members of my Administration for their hard work in making this agreement a reality.  The United States looks forward to implementing the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with Poland and to continuing our important work together.

本屆政府為美國武裝力量所做的工作比歷史上其他政府做的要多，包括全面重建我們的軍隊。該協議是一系列行動中的又一個，它將會保護我們的部隊並提升其執行任務的能力。除此之外，該項協議是其他國家平分負擔方面的典範。我感謝杜達總統，波蘭人民以及我政府團隊的成員，感謝各位為使這項協議成為現實所做的辛勤工作。美國期待與波蘭執行《增強國防合作協定》，並希望我們繼續共同努力。
