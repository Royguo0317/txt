The Uighurs are a mostly Muslim Turkic minority group that number about 11 million in Xinjiang in north-western China. The region borders Kazakhstan and is also home to ethnic Kazakhs. Ziawudun, who is 42, is Uighur. Her husband is a Kazakh.

维吾尔族是约有1100万的少数民族，在中国西北部的新疆，主要由穆斯林突厥人构成。 该地区与哈萨克斯坦接壤，也是哈萨克族的家乡。42岁的齐亚乌敦（Ziawudun）是维吾尔族。 她的丈夫是哈萨克人。

The couple returned to Xinjiang in late 2016 after a five-year stay in Kazakhstan, and were interrogated on arrival and had their passports confiscated, Ziawudun said. A few months later, she was told by police to attend a meeting alongside other Uighurs and Kazakhs and the group was rounded up and detained.

齐亚乌敦说，在哈萨克斯坦呆了五年后，他们夫妇于2016年底返回新疆，并在抵达时受到讯问，被没收了护照。 几个月后，警方让她与其他维吾尔和哈萨克人一起参加一个会议，随后这些人被围捕并遭拘留。

Her first stint in detention was comparatively easy, she said, with decent food and access to her phone. After a month she developed stomach ulcers and was released. Her husband’s passport was returned and he went back to Kazakhstan to work, but authorities kept Ziawudun’s, trapping her in Xinjiang. Reports suggest China has purposefully kept behind and interned relatives to discourage those who leave from speaking out. On 9 March 2018, with her husband still in Kazakhstan, Ziawudun was instructed to report to a local police station, she said. She was told she needed “more education”.

她说，她第一次被拘禁的经历没有那么痛苦，因为那里提供的食物还不错，而且人可以打电话。 一个月后，她因患上了胃溃疡而被释放。她丈夫的护照被退回，他回到哈萨克斯坦工作，但当局扣留了齐亚乌敦的护照，将她困在新疆。报道表明，中共国故意扣押被施放人员的亲属，以阻止他们发声。她说，2018年3月9日，当时她的丈夫仍在哈萨克斯坦，齐亚乌敦被指示向当地派出所汇报。 她被告知她需要接受“更多的教育”。

According to her account, Ziawudun was transported back to the same facility as her previous detention, in Kunes county, but the site had been significantly developed, she said. Buses were lined up outside offloading new detainees “non-stop”.

根据齐亚乌敦的说法，她被转移回她先前在库内斯县被拘禁的同一设施，但该处所的情况已经大为改变。 公共汽车在外面排着队，“不停地”运来新的被拘禁者。

The women had their jewellery confiscated. Ziawudun’s earrings were yanked out, she said, causing her ears to bleed, and she was herded into a room with a group of women. Among them was an elderly woman who Ziawudun would later befriend.

妇女们的珠宝被没收。 齐亚乌敦说，她的耳环被拉出，导致耳朵流血，然后与一群妇女一起被塞进一个房间。 其中有一位老年妇女，齐亚乌敦后来与她成为了朋友。

The camp guards pulled off the woman’s headscarf, Ziawudun said, and shouted at her for wearing a long dress – one of a list of religious expressions that became arrestable offences for Uighurs that year.

齐亚乌敦说，集中营警卫拉下她的头巾，并因她穿着一件长裙而冲她大喊大叫——长裙是维吾尔人一系列宗教象征之一，也是维吾尔人被捕的原因。

“They stripped everything off the elderly lady, leaving her with just her underwear. She was so embarrassed that she tried to cover herself with her arms,” Ziawudun said.

齐亚乌敦说：“他们剥光了这位年长女士的一切衣服，只剩下内裤。她很尴尬，试图用胳膊遮挡住自己。”

“I cried so much watching the way they treated her. Her tears fell like rain.”

“看着他们对待她的方式，我哭了很久。她也泪如雨下。”

The women were told to hand over their shoes and any clothes with elastic or buttons, Ziawudun said, then taken to cellblocks – “similar to a small Chinese neighbourhood where there are rows of buildings”.

齐亚乌敦说，这些妇女被告知要上交鞋和含松紧带或纽扣的任何衣物，然后被带到牢房里，“就像一个小的居民区，那里有一排排的建筑物”。

Nothing much happened for the first month or two. They were forced to watch propaganda programmes in their cells and had their hair forcibly cut short.

前一两个月没有发生什么。 他们被迫在牢房中观看宣传节目，并被强行剪短头发。

Then police began interrogating Ziawudun about her absent husband, she said, knocking her on the floor when she resisted and kicking her in the abdomen.

随后，警察审问她丈夫的情况。在她抵抗时将其打倒在地，并踢她腹部。

“Police boots are very hard and heavy, so at first I thought he was beating me with something,” she said. “Then I realised that he was trampling on my belly. I almost passed out – I felt a hot flush go through me.”

她说：“警靴很硬很重，所以起初我以为他在用什么其他的东西殴打我。后来我意识到他在踩我的肚子。我差点昏倒了，我感觉到一股热流在我体内涌动。”

A camp doctor told her she might have a blood clot. When her cellmates drew attention to the fact that she was bleeding, the guards “replied saying it is normal for women to bleed”, she said.

一名集中营的医生告诉她，她体内可能有血块。 她说，当她的囚友提醒警卫注意她正在流血时，警卫回答说“女性流血是正常的现象”。

According to Ziawudun, each cell was home to 14 women, with bunk beds, bars on the windows, a basin and a hole-in-the-floor-style toilet. When she first saw women being taken out of the cell at night, she didn’t understand why, she said. She thought they were being moved elsewhere.

根据齐亚乌敦的说法，每个牢房有十四名妇女，配有双层床，窗户上有栏杆，有一个洗手盆和蹲式厕所。 她说，当她第一次看到有女人在晚上被带出牢房时，她还不明白为什么。 她以为她们被转移到其他地方了。

Then sometime in May 2018 – “I don’t remember the exact date, because you don’t remember the dates inside there” – Ziawudun and a cellmate, a woman in her twenties, were taken out at night and presented to a Chinese man in a mask, she said. Her cellmate was taken into a separate room.

在2018年5月的某个时候——“我不记得确切的日期，因为你不记得里面的日期”——齐亚乌敦和一个二十多岁的女性狱友在晚上被带出，带到一个带着口罩的中国男人面前。 她的狱友则被带到一个单独的房间。

“As soon as she went inside she started screaming,” Ziawudun said. “I don’t know how to explain to you, I thought they were torturing her. I never thought about them raping.”

齐亚乌敦说：“她一进去就开始尖叫。我不知道该如何向你解释，我以为他们在折磨她。我从没想过他们在强奸她。”

The woman who had brought them from the cells told the men about Ziawudun’s recent bleeding.

从牢房带走她们的女人告诉那几个男人齐亚乌敦最近在流血。

“After the woman spoke about my condition, the Chinese man swore at her. The man with the mask said ‘Take her to the dark room’.

“那个女人说了我的病情之后，那个中国男人开始骂她。那个戴着口罩的男人说“带她去黑屋”。

“The woman took me to the room next to where the other girl had been taken in. They had an electric stick, I didn’t know what it was, and it was pushed inside my genital tract, torturing me with an electric shock.”

“那个女人把我带到另一个女孩被带去的隔壁房间。他们有一个电棍，我不知道那是什么，它被推到我的阴道内，电击折磨我。”

Ziawudun’s torture that first night in the dark room eventually came to an end, she said, when the woman intervened again citing her medical condition, and she was returned to the cell.

齐亚乌敦说，她在黑屋的第一个晚上的酷刑终于结束了，当那名妇女以她的病情再次进行干预时，齐亚乌敦被送回了牢房。

About an hour later, her cellmate was brought back.

大约一个小时后，她的狱友被带回来了。

“The girl became completely different after that, she wouldn’t speak to anyone, she sat quietly staring as if in a trance,” Ziawudun said. “There were many people in those cells who lost their minds.”

齐亚乌敦说：“此后，这个女孩变得完全不同了，她不会和任何人说话，她精神恍惚静静地凝视着前方发呆。有很多人在牢房里精神失常。”

Alongside cells, another central feature of the camps is classrooms. Teachers have been drafted in to “re-educate” the detainees – a process activists say is designed to strip the Uighurs and other minorities of their culture, language and religion, and indoctrinate them into mainstream Chinese culture.

除牢房外，集中营的另一个主要特征是教室。据活动人士说， 教师被招募进来对被拘禁者进行“再教育”。这一过程旨在剥夺维吾尔人和其他少数民族的文化，语言和宗教信仰，并给他们灌输主流中共国文化。

Qelbinur Sedik, an Uzbek woman from Xinjiang, was among the Chinese language teachers brought into the camps and coerced into giving lessons to the detainees. Sedik has since fled China and spoken publicly about her experience.

来自新疆的乌兹别克族妇女奎比奈·塞迪克（Qelbinur Sedik）是被带到集中营并被迫给被拘禁者上课的中文老师之一。 此后，塞迪克（Sedik）逃离中共国，公开讲述了她的经历。

The women’s camp was “tightly controlled”, Sedik told the BBC. But she heard stories, she said – signs and rumours of rape. One day, Sedik cautiously approached a Chinese camp policewoman she knew.

塞迪克告诉英国广播公司，妇女集中营受到“严格控制”。 但她说，她听到了一些故事——关于遭受强奸的迹象和流言。 有一天，塞迪克小心翼翼的与她认识的一名集中营里的女警接触。

“I asked her, ‘I have been hearing some terrible stories about rape, do you know about it?’ She said we should talk in the courtyard during lunch.

我问她：“我听到过一些关于强奸的可怕故事，你知道吗？” 她说我们应该在午餐时间在院子里谈。

“So I went to the courtyard, where there were not many cameras. She said, ‘Yes, the rape has become a culture. It is gang rape and the Chinese police not only rape them but also electrocute them. They are subject to horrific torture.'”

所以我去了没有很多摄像头的院子。她说：“是的，强奸已成为一种文化。这是轮奸，中共国警察不仅强奸了他们，还电击她们。她们遭受了可怕的酷刑。”

That night Sedik didn’t sleep at all, she said. “I was thinking about my daughter who was studying abroad and I cried all night.”

塞迪克说，那天晚上她根本没有睡觉。  “想到我正在国外学习的女儿，我哭了一整夜。”

She was later accused of crossing illegally into Kazakhstan 集中营教师塞拉古尔·索伊特贝（Sayragul Sauytbay），说她目睹了一场可怕的强奸。 她后来被指控非法越境进入哈萨克斯坦
In separate testimony to the Uyghur Human Rights Project, Sedik said she heard about an electrified stick being inserted into women to torture them – echoing the experience Ziawudun described.

在给《维吾尔人权项目》的另一次证词中，塞迪克（Sedik）说，她听说有人将一根电棍插入妇女的身体来折磨她们，这与齐亚乌敦描述的经历相呼应。

There were “four kinds of electric shock”, Sedik said – “the chair, the glove, the helmet, and anal rape with a stick”.

塞迪克说，有“四种电击”，即“椅子，手套，头盔和电棍肛奸”。

“The screams echoed throughout the building,” she said. “I could hear them during lunch and sometimes when I was in class.”

她说：“尖叫声在整个建筑中回荡。我可以在午餐时间，有时在上课的时候听到尖叫声。”

Another teacher forced to work in the camps, Sayragul Sauytbay, told the BBC that “rape was common” and the guards “picked the girls and young women they wanted and took them away”.

另一位被迫在集中营工作的老师塞拉古尔·索伊特贝（Sayragul Sauytbay）告诉英国广播公司，“强奸很普遍”，而警卫人员则“挑选他们想要的女孩和年轻妇女带走”。

She described witnessing a harrowing public gang rape of a woman of just 20 or 21, who was brought before about 100 other detainees to make a forced confession.

她描述了亲眼目睹一个只有20或21岁的年轻女子被公开轮奸的可怕情景，那女子被带到大约100名其他被拘禁者面前，强迫认罪。

“After that, in front of everyone, the police took turns to rape her,” Sauytbay said.

索伊特贝说：“在那之后，警察在所有人面前轮流强奸她。”

“While carrying out this test, they watched people closely and picked out anyone who resisted, clenched their fists, closed their eyes, or looked away, and took them for punishment.”

“进行这项测试时，警察密切注视所有人，并挑出任何表现出抵抗，握紧拳头，闭上眼睛或移开视线的人，将她们带走进行惩罚。”

The young woman cried out for help, Sauytbay said.

索伊特贝说，那名年轻女子大声呼救。

“It was absolutely horrendous,” she said. “I felt I had died. I was dead.”

她说：“那绝对是极其恐怖的。我觉得我已经死了。我死了。”
