英語標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep 204:  “China’s days as the world’s factory are over.”



視頻重點

1. 中共病毒疫情大流行衝擊製造業，疫情令富士康大陸工廠受到重創。 8月14日，蘋果最大代工廠富士康逐步將生產遷往東南亞，宣告”中國作為世界工廠的日子已經結束”。但中共官媒轉移話題，宣傳人民幣國際化的快速增長。
2. 8月7日黑警淩晨闖香港深水埗大埔道的黃店餐廳翻文件， 被踢爆後黑警不認錯。從1997年香港主權移交之日起，當時的中共獨裁者江澤民及曾慶紅，便開始向香港警隊“摻沙子”。香港警隊高層都曾到中國大陸接受過中共培訓。為什麼香港黑警越來越黑？就因為他們最高的主子江澤民、曾慶紅是中共黑惡勢力中最黑的流氓頭子。中共對香港警隊進行長年的滲透。
3. Natalie Winters：布倫丹·達利曾任南茜·佩洛西的傳播總監和發言人近十年，之後在遊說公關公司奧美任執行副總裁。在那裡他實際上牽頭公司與CCTV簽約。基於《外國代理人登記法》的註冊資訊，該公司受中共“監督、擁有、指導、控制、資助及補貼”。
4. 其他國家最近紛紛表態，美國大選之後要改組聯合國。就會把共產黨，把現在的中華人民共和國的政府，合法代表中國人民14億人民在國際上地位，kick off踢出去。另，共產黨，從沒人敢說：“推翻共產黨，消滅共產黨。”現在全世界說：“共產黨必須為這次病毒承擔一切責任，要把它送上審判法庭。”
5. 新疆的這一輪疫情爆發後，為掩蓋疫情的真相，當局採取了強制封閉管理。私自外出人員會遭到重罰，呵斥、上門警告，甚至拘留、體罰等，有些地區甚至用高音喇叭警告居民“出門打斷腿，還嘴打掉牙”，在中共的集權統治下，執法手段拙劣剝奪做人尊嚴。


1. The Chinese manufacturing sector is falling down. On August 14, Foxconn, Apple’s largest manufacturer, announced it will gradually shift its production line to Southeast Asia, which means that “China’s days as the world’s factory are over.” CCP’s official media tried to draw attention away from this by barely reporting it and by bragging the internationalization of the RMB .
2. Hong Kong corrupt CCP police broke into a “yellow shop” (a business supporting the freedom movement) early in the morning. After being exposed, they did not admit their crime. In fact, the Hong Kong police has been increasingly corrupted by the CCP since 1997, on the order of Jiang Zemin and Zeng Qinghong. Since then, its staff has been invaded by cops from the mainland and its leadership has traveled often to mainland to swear their allegiance to the CCP.
3. Natalie Winters: Brendan Daly, who served as Nancy Pelosi’s communications director and spokesperson for nearly a decade, went on to serve as executive vice president at a lobbying and PR firm known as Ogilvy. And there he actually spearheaded the firm’s contract with China Central Television. According to the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the information of this company indicated that it’s “supervised, owned, directed, controlled, financed and subsidized” by the Chinese Communist Party.
4. Miles Guo:  Some countries have expressed their support to re-organize the U.N. after the U.S. presidential election. This will kick the CCP, the current PRC government, out of the status as the legitimate representative of the 1.4 billion Chinese people in the international community. In addition, in the past no one ever dared to say “Take down the CCP” or “Eliminate the CCP,” but now the whole world are saying that the CCP must be held fully accountable for the pandemic and be brought to justice.
5. In Xinjiang, to hide the truth of the outbreak, people leaving their home without a permit would be vocally warned, physically abused, or even put behind bars. The local propaganda has also threatened the residents that “we will break your legs if you get caught outdoor, we will smash your teeth out if you dare to disobey”. Under CCP’s rule, the law enforcement is a disgrace in itself and a disrespect to basic human dignity.
