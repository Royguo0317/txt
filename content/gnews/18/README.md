**路德**
布林肯最重磅的最新讲话
The most important latest speech from Antony Blinken

说我们将继续推进彻底和透明的调查这次病毒大流行的起源
He said, we are looking and pushing for complete and transparent investigation into origin of the pandemic

搞清楚到底发生了什么，从而避免任何生物威胁再次发生
to learn what happened and so that the biological threat doesn’t happen again

否则我们将对不起我们的子孙后代
Otherwise, we will badly let us future generations down

这是历史的关键时刻，我们要敢想，敢干
This is critical moment, the time for us to think big and act boldly

美国将直面挑战
And the United States will face the challenge

前段时间布林肯接受采访的时候
When Blinken was interviewed some time ago

说我们要预防第二次以及未来生物威胁
He said that we have to prevent the second time as well as the future biological threat

我们当时说了，为什么要预防第二次?
We (Lude Media) said at that time, why do they have to prevent the second time?

就是，先做好防守
which is, make the defense first

因为美国已经意识到这就是中共的生物威胁
Because the United States has realized that this is the biological threat of the CCP

布林肯这个词不是一个中性词，生物威胁恐怖主义
The word, biological threat terrorism, that Brinken used is not a neutral word

要彻查，透明的调查
It has to be thoroughly and transparently investigated

如果来自自然的他会说这个话?
If the virus comes from nature, would he say this?

说什么对不起子孙后代，
He should not say something about being sorry for future generations

因为自然的谁都不知道什么时候会出来
Because if the virus came from nature, who doesn’t know when it will come out

谁都不知道到底从哪个地方出来
Nobody knows exactly where it will come out

这句话其实就告诉了生物威胁，就是超限生物武器
This statement actually tells that the biological threat is the unrestricted bioweapon

生物威胁为什么他现在不说叫生物战, 或者叫生物武器?
(He said) biological threat. Why doesn’t he call it biowarfare or bioweapon at this moment?

因为这是超越生物武器，是叫超限生物武器
Because this is beyond bioweapon and it is unrestricted bioweapon

所以他用生物威胁先来告诉美国人这是生物威胁了
So, he used the biological threat first to tell the Americans that this is a biological threat

生物恐怖主义其实就是超限生物武器
Bioterrorism is actually unrestricted bioweapon

因为它不是一个生物战的概念
Because it is not a concept of biowarfare

就像恐怖主义，当时的911
It’s like terrorism. It was 911

它不是对你美国宣战，但这是恐怖主义
it wasn’t a declaration of war against the United States, but it was terrorism

现在中共搞得是生物恐怖主义，超限生物武器
Now the Chinese Communist Party is engaging in bioterrorism using unrestricted bioweapon

大家看明白没有?几个月以来都验证了美国拜登政府上台以后
Do you see clearly? It’s been verified for several months after the Biden administration came to power

真正的都已经各方面的准备工作都已经准备好了
All the preparations have been fully completed

中共他所有的威胁就是那种便宜的所谓的导弹
All the Chinese Communist Party’s threats are their cheap so-called missiles

能打个100多公里，是吧?
which can make more than 100 kilometers, right?

反正我万导齐发。就这种又便宜
The CCP might launch tens of thousands their cheap missiles

前面带一些东西。
(They might) carry something on the missile warhead.

带一些炸弹，甚至带一些生物的这种东西
Or carry some bombs, even some biological stuff

如果到你上空可能都危险
If it comes over your sky, it may be dangerous

所以一定要在半路就给你拦截掉
So, it must be intercepted on its halfway

当然韩国可能是一个巨大威胁，面临北朝鲜
Of course, South Korea may have a huge threat, since it is facing North Korea

所以这方面全部都准备好。准备好才说这话
So, all are prepared. Preparations have been done before he could say this
