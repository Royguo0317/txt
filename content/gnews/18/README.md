## 全世界和我们一起灭共
` TINALS` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/683277/)

在2020年12月23日的盖特视频中，郭文贵先生说中共国家安全委员会把解决缺粮的问题和防止挤兑排在国家安全最紧急的位置。现在跟非洲国家商量，把非洲的农作物要拿人民币进口，听说非洲一开始都说愿意要人民币，但昨天基本上都拒绝了。中国外交部写了报告，说全世界据了解超过120个国家正在酝酿、商量排查属于中共党员和政府的工作职员所有的名单，包括国有企业。很多国家政府都知道病毒是共产党的生化武器，可怜这全世界因为钱都泯灭了良心，没有了一点智商。全世界集体的暴露让世界和我们一起灭共。

It’s December 23, Brother Miles just finished showering, I just got out of the shower. I’ve been in meetings all day until now, with less than ten minutes of break, for almost twelve hours. It’s great. Before showering, I received a call from a friend in China. Said friend, who may not be a brother-in-arm, told me about the situation in China, and it was just – BIAs, is there food shortage in China? How bad is the food shortage in China? Yesterday afternoon, the National Security Commission of the CCP ranked resolving the food shortage at the top. Preventing large-scale financial security incidents – basically, bank runs – and not letting you withdraw your money has also been deemed a matter of national security. Having no food and not being allowed to withdraw money will lead to large-scale protests and even riots; a riot is when the people speak out peacefully. These have been ranked at the top of national security issues.

12月23号，现在是你们看到的七哥是刚刚淋浴完，刚刚出了淋浴后的。现在你们的七哥，今天从开会到现在大概中间停不超过10分钟，开了将近12小时的会，很好。刚刚在冲浴前，收到了咱们国内的朋友的电话，国内的朋友不一定是战友，听到他讲国内的情况简直是，战友们国内缺粮了吗，缺粮缺到啥程度了，昨天下午中共国家安全委员会，把解决缺粮的问题排在首位，防止金融大规模的治安事件，也就是挤兑，不让你取钱，放在了国家安全的位置，因以上没粮食不让取钱，导致社会的大规模的抗议、上街，甚至所谓的暴乱、骚乱，啥叫暴乱？就是说老百姓和平发声呗，排在国家安全最紧急的位置。

They also said that no matter what, do not have any conflicts with Americans in the South China Sea. If there is no other way, just attack Taiwan. Attack Taiwan to solve internal problems. Banks are done for, all the overseas Chinese enterprises that swindle US dollars are done for, and food is running out. They are negotiating with countries in Africa to import their crops using Chinese Yuan. I heard that those African countries were willing to take Chinese Yuan at first, but yesterday they almost all declined. Such a huge change in less than 48 hours, all declined. Chinese nationals cannot study abroad; those abroad are being sent back to China.

而且说无论如何在南海，跟美国人都不要有冲突，不行就打台湾，解决内部的问题要打台湾，银行完了吧，所有在国外的所谓的，骗美金的中资企业完了吧，没粮食了吧，现在跟非洲国家商量，把在非洲进行的农作物要拿人民币进，听说非洲一开始都说愿意要人民币，昨天基本上都拒绝了，不到48小时这么大的变化，都拒绝了，中国人不能出国留学，出国留学的被撵回去。

Furthermore, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has, for the first time, written a report to the National Security Commission – so, the Politburo – that says more than 120 countries in the world are planning and discussing the checking of a list of all Chinese Communist Party members and government employees, which may very well trigger the world to be against the CCP and against the overseas Chinese government employees, including people from state-owned Chinese enterprises. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that other governments are ready to stand with the US regarding the CCP-controlled state-owned Chinese enterprises. Many countries will investigate their government officials of the past decade, from 2012 until now, concerning where the money from bailouts and loans they received from China went. Most went to kickbacks. I heard that a few bastards in Europe are scared. They are scared. How can they explain this? They took so much kickbacks.

而且中国外交部第一次，给国家安全委员会也就是常委坑写了报告，说全世界据了解超过120个国家，正在酝酿、商量排查属于中共党员和政府的工作职员所有的名单，很有可能引发全世界的，反共、反中国政府的海外的工作人员，包括国有企业，外交部说，各国政府正都准备和美国一起，对中国共产党控制的国有企业，包括很多国家现在要查当时，过去这十多年、2012年到现在，这十多年的当时执政的政府官员，在中国所得到的就救助和贷款去向，大多数是回扣了嘛。据说，欧洲的几个混蛋害怕了，害怕了，咋交代啊？吃那么多回扣。

Many governments believe that this virus, they know that this virus is the CCP’s bioweapon. They also know that if they do not hold the CCP accountable, their people won’t accept it. So what to do? Many are suggesting that the Chinese government should place the blame on select employees of the Wuhan lab for leaking the virus intentionally or unintentionally and stop arguing whether this virus came from nature. Just say that it was leaked from the lab unintentionally or leaked by certain people, or that it was leaked to exact revenge on society. They suggest to the CCP to file a case and investigate quickly. The CCP, do you think the CCP’s tricks are good? Not at all, but unfortunately, the entire world has discarded its conscience for money, completely mindless. God has really given us the greatest opportunity to take down the CCP. The world has been exposed and will take down the CCP with us together.

而且很多国家政府都认为这个病毒，都知道，明净的共产党干的生化武器，而且大家都知道，甚至很多人都说，不给共产党究责，将对自己的国民没办法交代啊，怎么办？很多人谏言中国政府应该将这个责任，归咎在武汉实验室部分人员故意泄露，或者是非故意泄露上，不要再纠缠于所谓来自于自然和人了，就说是实验室非故意泄露或部分某些人泄露，或者报复社会泄露，建议中共赶快要立案查处这事，共产党啊共产党，你说他完这个招儿高不高？一点儿都不高，可怜这全世界因为钱都泯灭了良心，没有了一点智商，上天真的是给了我们最大的机会–灭共。让全世界集体的暴露，并和我们一起灭共。
