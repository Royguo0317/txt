## V. Contestable Process Fouls 

## V.有争议的程序违规

Contestable process fouls represent the third dimension of election irregularities in the 2020 presidential election. The various forms such process fouls can take are illustrated in Table 5 across the six battleground states.

在2020年总统大选中，有争议的程序违规体现了选举舞弊的第三个层面。这种程序违规横跨于六大战场州之中，采取各种形式，正如表五所示。

### **Abuses of Poll Watchers and Observers **

### **对投票观察员与监督员不公**

Central to the fairness and integrity of any election is the processes by which observers monitor the receipt, opening, and counting of the ballots. You can see in the Table 5 that poll watcher and observer abuses were present across all six battleground states.

任何选举的公平性与完整性的核心是监票员监督选票的接收，打开与计票的过程。在表五中，您可以看到选票观察员与监督员在所有六个关键战场州中的所受到的不正公待遇。

In Georgia,66 Michigan,67 and Pennsylvania,68 poll watchers and observers were denied entry to ballot counting centers by Judges of Elections and other poll workers. This was despite presenting proper certification and identification.

在佐治亚州， 密歇根州，和宾西法尼亚州，不论选票监督员和观察员是否提供了有效的文件与身份证明，选举法官和其他选票工作人员都拒共和党的投票观察员和监督员进入计票站。

In Georgia,69 Michigan,70 Nevada,71 and Pennsylvania,72 Republican poll watchers were also forced inside confined areas, thereby limiting their view. In some cases, this confinement was enforced by local law enforcement.

同时，在佐治亚州， 密歇根州，内华达州，和宾西法尼亚州，共和党的投票观察员被强制要求呆在密闭区域里， 由此来限制他们的视线。在某些事例中，这种禁闭(行为)是由当地执法部门强制执行的**。**

Across these four battleground states, Republican poll watchers were also directed to stand at unreasonably lengthy distances from ballot counters. In Michigan – arguably the “first among equals” when it comes to observer abuses – poll workers put up poster boards on the windows of the room where ballots were being processed and counted so as to block the view.73 In Pennsylvania, tens of thousands of ballots were processed in back rooms where poll observers were prohibited from being able to observe at all.74

在这四个战场州中，共和党的投票观察员被要求站在离计票器非常远的地方。在密歇根州，在不公正对待观察员方面可以说无人出其右了—投票工作人员用海报板将处理选票和计票房间的窗户挡住。在宾西法尼亚州，成千上万的选票都在暗室操作的，观察员根本就是被禁止监察的**。**

This is an extremely serious matter because it is these poll watchers and observers who represent the frontline defenders of a fair election process. Their job is to make sure all ballots are handled properly and tabulated accordingly. They seek to answer questions like: Is there a signature match process being conducted? Does each ballot have an outer envelope or is it a naked ballot? Are ballots being run more than once through the tabulation machines?

这是一个极其严重的问题，投票观察员和监督员们代表了一个公平选举过程中的前线捍卫者。他们的工作是要确保所有的选票都是经过正确处理登记造册的。他们试图回答这样的问题：对比签名的程序是否被执行？是否每张选票都配有外部信封？或者这是一张无记名投票吗？ 是否有选票被制表机扫描了不止一次？

When poll watchers or observers are barred from viewing or forced to view from unacceptably large distances, these watchdogs cannot accurately answer these questions. They, therefore, cannot fulfill their critical watchdog function.

当投票观察员或监督员被禁止观察或被迫在一个不可接受的远距离观察时， 这些监督员无法准确的回答这些（以上）问题。因此，他们无法履行他们做为监视者的关键职能。

### **Mail-In Ballot and Absentee Ballot Rules Violated Contrary to State Law **

### **邮寄选票和缺席选票的规定违背了州法律**

In Georgia, more than 300,000 individuals were permitted to vote who had applied for an absentee ballot more than 180 days prior to the Election Day. This is a clear violation of state law.75

在佐治亚州，有超过三十万人在大选日前180天之前申请缺席选票的投票并获准投票。这显然违反了州法律。

In both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Democrat election officials acted unilaterally to accept both mail-in and absentee ballots after Election Day. State Republicans have argued this is contrary to state law.

在宾西法尼亚州和威斯康辛州中，民主党的选举官员单方面决定在选举日后接受邮寄选票和缺席选票，州共和党人认为这一行为违反了州法律。

In Pennsylvania, absentee and mail-in ballots were accepted up to three days after Election Day.76 On November 7th, in anticipation of a legal challenge, the United States Supreme Court ordered that the approximately 10,000 absentee and mail-in ballots that had arrived past November 3rd be separated from ballots that had arrived on Election Day.77 This direction notwithstanding, a poll watcher reported on November 7th that, in Delaware County, ballots received the previous night were not being separated from ballots received on Election Day, contrary to state law.78

在宾西法尼亚州，在选举日三天后仍接受缺席选票和邮寄选票。11月7日，在一个意料之中的法律挑战中， 美国最高法院下令将大约一万张11月3号以后收到的缺席选票和邮寄选票与选举日收到的选票分开。尽管这样，11月7日据一名观察员报告说，在特拉华县，在前一天晚上收到选票并没有与选举日当日收到的选票区分开，这违反了州法律。

Wisconsin state law does not permit early voting. Nonetheless, city officials in the Democrat stronghold of Madison, Wisconsin assisted in the creation of more than 200 “Democracy in the Park” illegal polling places.

威斯康辛州州法不允许提前投票。尽管如此，威斯康辛民主党大本营麦迪逊的市政官员们协肋成立了超过200 个“公园里的民主”的非法投票点。

These *faux*polling places were promoted and supported by the Biden campaign. They provided witnesses for absentee ballots and acted in every way like legal polling places. Moreover, they received ballots outside of the limited 14-day period preceding an election that is authorized by statute for in-person or absentee balloting. These were clear violations of state law.79

这些虚假的投票点是由拜登竞选团队支持和推广的。他们为缺席选票提供证人，各种方面都表现的像是合法的投票点一样。除此之外，他们在选举前14天的期限以外接受选票，而这个期限是根据法律授权的，可进行亲自投票或缺席选票。这些明显违反了州法。

### **Voters Not Properly Registered Allowed to Vote **

### **允许未经正确登记的选民投票**

One of the jobs of poll workers is to ensure that in-person voters are legally registered and are who they say they are. Across at least three of the six battleground states – Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin – this job may not have been effectively done.

投票工作人员的其中一个工作是确保亲自投票的选民是合法注册登记的，并且是他们所说的人。在六个战场州中的至少三个州，佐治亚州，内华达州和威斯康辛州，这项工作没有被有效的完成。

In Wisconsin, for example, officials refused to allow poll watchers to challenge the qualifications of people applying to vote or require proof of such persons’ qualifications.80 In Georgia, more than 2,000 individuals appear to have voted who were not listed in the State’s records as having been registered to vote.81

例如，在威斯康辛州官员拒绝允许投票观察员就选民申请投票的资格提出质疑，或要求提供此人资格的证明。在佐治亚州，有超过2000个人已经投票，但似乎并没有在州政府的登记中显示他们已经投票的记录。

In Pennsylvania, a poll watcher observed poll workers taking individuals whose names did not appear in voter registration books back into a separate area that was unobserved by any poll watchers. There, these apparently unregistered voters met with a Judge of Elections who allegedly told them: “you go back in, tell them this is your name, and you can vote.”82

在宾西法尼亚州，一名投票观察员看到，投票工作人员把那些名字不在选民登记薄中的人带到一个单独的区域，那个区域是任何投票观察员都看不到的地方。在那里， 这些明显没有登记的选民会见一名法官，据称这名法官对他们说：“你回去，告诉他们这是你的名字，你就可以投票了”。

### **Illegal Campaigning at Poll Locations **

### **投票地点的非法竞选活动**

Poll workers are supposed to remain politically neutral. When a poll worker displays bias for one political candidate over another at a polling location, this is contrary to state law. Unfortunately, this law appears to have been repeatedly violated in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

投票工作人员应当保持政治中立性。当一名投票工作人员在投票点表现出了对一名政治侯选人于另外一名的偏好时，这是违反州法的。不幸的是，这项法律在密歇根州，宾西法尼亚州和威斯康辛屡次被违反。

For example, in Pennsylvania, poll workers were wearing paraphernalia from a group called “Voter Protection.” This is a 100% Democrat-funded Political Action Committee dedicated to Democrat redistricting in Pennsylvania; and the wearing of its paraphernalia constitutes illegal campaigning at the polls.83

例如在宾西法尼亚州，投票工作人员的装备来自于一个叫做“选民保护”的组织。这是一个100%由民主党资助的政治行动委员会，致力于民主党在宾西法尼亚州重新划分区域；配带这些装备构成在投票点的非法竞选活动。

In a similar type of illegal campaigning in Michigan, poll workers were allowed to wear Black Lives Matter shirts and were seen carrying tote bags of President Obama paraphernalia.84 In addition, poll workers with Biden and Obama campaign shirts on were allowed on the ballot counting floor.85

密歇根州中的类似非法竞选活动中，投票工作人员被允许身着“黑人生命同样重要”的衬衫，并被发现拎着奥巴马总统用具的手提包。除此之外，在计票楼层，投票工作人员可以穿拜登和奥巴马的竞选衬衫。

In Wisconsin, representatives from the Biden campaign were outside with clipboards talking to voters on their way in to vote. They were clearly inside the prohibited perimeter for electioneering. Poll workers did nothing to address this illegal campaigning despite the objections of observers.86

在威斯康辛州，拜登竞选团队的代表，在外面拿着书写板与选民在他们去投票的路上交谈。他们显然越过了选举禁止的边界。无视观察员的反对，投票工作人员对这一违法的竞选行为毫无作为。

### **Ballots Cured by Poll Workers or Voters Contrary to Law **

### **投票工作人员或选民违非法纠正选票**

Under prescribed circumstances, both poll workers and voters may fix ballots with mistakes or discrepancies. This process is known as “ballot curing.”

在一些规定的情况下，投票工作人员与选民可以修正有错误或差异的选票。这个过程被称为”选票纠正“

In nineteen states, poll workers must notify voters if there are errors or discrepancies on their ballots and allow them to “cure” or correct any errors so their votes will count.87 However, in states that do not allow curing, ballots with discrepancies such as missing or mismatched signatures must be discarded.88

在 19个州中，投票工作人员必须告知投票人如果在选票上发现了错误或差异，并允许他们修正或更正以便他们的选票可以被计入。 然而，在不允许修改的州，必须丢弃有差异的选票，例如签名缺失或不匹配。

In Pennsylvania, and contrary to state law, poll workers were trained to allow voters to cure or “correct” their ballots.89 According to one court filing, Democrat-controlled counties in Pennsylvania participated in pre-canvass activities prior to Election Day “by reviewing received mail-in ballots for deficiencies.”90 Such discrepancies included “lacking the inner secrecy envelope or lacking a signature of the elector on the outer declaration envelope.” Voters were then notified so that they could cure their ballots – a clear violation of state law.91

在宾西法尼亚州，在不符合法律的情况下，投票工作人员经过培训去允许选民修正或“更正”他们的选票。根据一份法庭档案，在宾西法尼亚州民主党控制的县，在选举日前参加了一项的预选活动。“通过审察收到的邮寄选票的缺陷”，这种差异包括“缺少内部保密信封或外部公告信封上缺少一个选举人的签名。”然后选民被告知他们可以修改他们的选票，这明显的违反州法律。

Numerous other examples of illegally cured ballots abound. For example, in Wisconsin, tens of thousands of ballots were observed to be corrected or cured despite election observer objections.92

其它非法修正选票的事例比比皆是。比如说， 在威斯康辛州尽管观察员反对，发现仍有数以为万计的选票被更正或修正。

In Pennsylvania, poll workers sorted approximately 4,500 ballots with various errors into bins. Poll workers then re-filled out the 4,500 ballots so that they could be read by tabulation machines, an action contrary to state law.93

在宾西法尼亚州，投票工作人员将大约4,500张有错误的选票分类到（垃圾）箱里， 然后工作人员重新填了4,500制表机可以读取的选票，这是一个违反州法律的行为。

In Michigan, poll workers altered the dates on the outer envelopes of the ballots so that they would be able to count them.94 Michigan poll workers also filled out blank ballots to “correct” mail-in and absentee ballots according to what they believed the “voter had intended.”95

在密歇根州，投票工作人员将外部信封的日期换掉，以便他们可以将其计入。密歇根州的投票工作人员还填写空白选票，以便根据他们认为的“选民的意愿”去修正邮寄和缺席选票。
