**Lude Media on Nov 28, 2020 Morning**

宾州高院裁决书中承认“川普败诉”的裁决可能违宪

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania acknowledged the adjudication that “Trump lost” may be unconstitutional.

- 该裁决书最核心的是法官说，如果川普团队上诉至联邦法庭，该裁决可能违宪。
- The judge, who made the adjudication, said that it might be unconstitutional if the Trump team appeals to the federal court.


- 这名共和党法官的意思是，我根据州宪法判决川普团队败诉没有任何问题，但是如果按照联邦宪法，我这个裁决很可能违宪、是有问题的。
- The key point of the comments of this Republican judge is that he did the right judgment according to the state constitution, but this judgment might be unconstitutional base on the federal constitution.


- 这个法官的快速裁决，为川普团队上诉联邦法庭扫清了障碍，为最高大法官在12月14日之前作出裁决节约了宝贵的时间。
- The quick judgment of this state judge helped the Trump team to appeal to the federal court in an unobstructed way and saved valuable time for the Supreme Court to make the final judgment before December 14.


CNN承认川普可能翻盘意味着什么

What does that CNN acknowledged that Trump might turn the table mean?

共和党所控制的关键摇摆州的州议会相信存在欺诈，可能与州务卿在选举人团成员名单上打官司，交由联邦法庭裁决；如果裁决不能在12月14日完成，拜登将不足270票；最后交由联邦众议院按一州一票来选总统，结果是川普以26:23取胜。

The congress in a key Republican-controlled swing state believes election fraud, a possible battle with the Secretary of State on the electoral College list might go to the federal court. If the judgment cannot be made by the federal Supreme Court by December 14, Biden will not approach 270 votes. Finally, the Federal House of Representatives will vote the President on the basis of one vote per state, and the result will be Trump wins in 26:23.

该报道，表明中共和民主党对选举走向非常清楚，预示着后面的法律战将异常惨烈。

This report indicated that the CCP and the Democrats Swamp are well aware of the direction of the election, which means a tough legal battle that looms.

**中共的邪恶后手拳**

**The evil backup plan of the CCP**

- 如果双方不足270选举人票，众议院投票川普胜出无悬念，而副总统由联邦参议院投票决定，议长麦康纳尔若偏向中共， 有可能选出亲共副总统贺锦丽。


The House will vote for Trump to win the President, if the two sides fall short of 270 electoral votes. However, Harris might win the Vice President election in the Senate vote if majority leader, McConaughey, sides with the CCP.

- 出现上述局面时，中共很可能用黑社会手段干掉总统，民主党的副总统自然递补为总统。这就是中共策划已久的，在拜登先手拳失利之后，即将打出的后手拳。


In the above situation, the CCP might assassinate President Trump and help Harris to sworn in as President. This is the backup plan if Biden failed.

- 所以川普团队正在抓紧时间，争取在12月14日之前，推动联邦法庭作出延期邮寄选票无效的判决，以通过选举人票完胜拜登。


Hence, the Trump team is scrambling to get the federal court to invalidate the extended mail ballots before Dec. 14 in order to clinch an electoral college victory over Biden.

- 而中共的阴谋是，让在州务卿在重新计票上拖延时间至12月14日之后，仍将总统人选的决定权交给国会。
- The conspiracy of the CCP is to leave the decision on the President to the Congress through the delay of the recount process until Dec. 14 which is controlled by the secretary of state.


路德谈主流媒体为何都亲共

Lude explains why the mainstream media side with the CCP.

美国电视节目内容发布的4种方式网络视频直播、网络电视机顶盒、卫星电视、有线电视中，最普及的是在缴纳月费后的免费有线电视节目。但有线电视从光缆铺设、到包月菜单中的电视节目单，经过多年发展已经形成事实上的垄断，能够上这个节目单的电视台就是主流媒体。而这个垄断的市场早已被中共彻底渗透，所以出现了主流媒体全部亲共的现象。

In the four popular types of TV program, including live webcast, internet TV set-top box, satellite TV, and cable TV in the US, the most popular program is the cable TV with monthly fee. But the cable TV had been rigged from the cable laying to the monthly TV menu in the past years of development, this causes only the mainstream media could on the TV menu. The CCP had totally infiltrated this monopolistic TV market, and compelled the mainstream media to stand with the CCP.

鲍威尔诉讼文件证实水印存

Powell lawsuit documents confirmed the watermark is stored.

在起诉书的第35页选票水印被证实存在，这意味着川普总统启用了国家安全总统令，采用最高机密方式，将水印选票分发到选民手中，也意味着所有对选票舞弊的钓鱼策略布局已久，前两天曝光的Kraken计划暗示美国太空军也参与了此次钓鱼布局，正义川普与邪恶中共的较量中技高一筹方能拥有先手。

The existence of the watermark on the ballots was confirmed on page 35 of the indictment. This indicates that President Trump distributed watermark ballots to the voters by the top-secret way under the Presidential Decree on National Security. Also, it indicates that it was a long-term phishing tactics of voter fraud. The project Kraken, which was revealed days ago, suggested that the US Space Force also involves in the fishing. A better player can have a head start in the battle between the justice represented by Trump and the evil CCP.
