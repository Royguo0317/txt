## 【歌曲】好人 Kind people:當我們的臉孔名字 都成了不能公布的秘密
` GM132 每日快訊` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/1021065/)

**歌名**:**好人 Kind people**

這是一位無名的香港同胞 作詞作曲演唱的原創作品

因為 香港國安法的關係 所以他無法公開發表這首作品

因此由我們 新中國聯邦 正義的小伙伴接手來製作視頻

視頻內容是過去這些日子 香港同胞們所經歷過的一切

「當我們的臉孔名字 都成了不能公布的秘密

世間上的人們 還何以維持自己的正義呢？」

**歌词如下:**

生命恍如朝夕的繁花

Life is like a prosperous flower

总能将奇迹流传吧

Can always spread miracles

你是怜悯　降落城市　将一对翼折下

Mercifully landing in the city with your pair of wings

未惧怕走入悲情筑成的篱笆

Not afraid to step into the fence of sadness

以白袍一身见证高雅

Witness the elegance in a white robe

病床步履间　厘定了身价

The dedication you put into the hospital beds determines your worth.

要按时轮班太迟回家

you work shifts and you come home very late

脸上仍抹不褪是你牵挂

the concern is what still cannot be erased from your face

眼前是困苦吗　信明日会好吗

Is it the hardship you face? Do you think tomorrow you’ll be okay?

一生的好人　满心恻隐

The life of kind people is full of compassion

请祝福好人　祈求天公允

Please bless kind people and pray for the justice

同路在黄昏　如若是留心

On the same road at dusk, if you pay attention

能站在旁边  察觉你内蕴

you can stay still and perceive your connotation

简单的好人　平凡的身份

just kind people, with an ordinary identity

漆黑中守望　是为点一盏灯

in the dark watch for hope to light a lamp

一生好人　慷慨像你　会有护荫

The lives of kind and generous people like you will be blessed

要按时轮班太迟回家

you work shifts and you come home very late

脸上仍抹不褪是你牵挂

the concern is what still cannot be erased from your face

为寻觅美好吗

to look for splendor?

北风凛冽里栽花

Plant flowers in the icy north wind

照亮人世间构成图画

Light up the world and outline a drawing

寄在年月承受着风沙

Ride through the time and withstands sandstorms

为成就美好吗

to reach perfection?

替身边者铺砖筑瓦

They have put tiles and bricks for those around him.

一生的好人　满心恻隐

The life of kind people is full of compassion

请祝福好人　祈求天公允

Please bless kind people and pray for the justice

同路在黄昏　如若是留心

On the same road at dusk, if you pay attention

明白善良  丰富了你内蕴

Understand goodness and enrich your connotation

简单的好人　平凡的身份

just kind people, with an ordinary identity

漆黑中守望　是为点一盏灯

in the dark watch for hope to light a lamp

一生好人　珍贵像你　会有护荫

The lives of kind and precious people like you will be blessed.

一生的好人　满心恻隐

The life of kind people is full of compassion

天真的好人　常留低共振

Innocent and kind people often resonate with humility

从没问原因　怀着是纯真

They never ask why, they just possess innocence

良善就似天使危城俯瞰

Kindness is like heaven. The dangerous city looks up to see it

请祝福好人　求平安的一生

Please bless kind people and pray for a peaceful life.

漆黑中守望　烙下一双足印

in the dark look for hope to mark a set of footprints

充当好人　天会为你　化作树荫

Always be a kind person and heaven will become a blessing to you.
