共和党参议员约翰·科宁(John Cornyn)在国会听证会质问推特CEO杰克·多西（Jack Dorsey）：

Cornyn:
When Twitter decided to take down the story, the NY post story on Hunter Biden’s laptop, did you do that under your terms of service, or did you do it under some claim of authority?
推特决定将纽约邮报关于亨特·拜登笔记本电脑的报道下架时，你这么做是因为你的服务条款，还是因为某种权利？

Dorsey:
We did under our term of service, which as you know everyone agrees on their signup to Twitter. This is a policy around distribution of hacked materials. We do not want Twitter to be a distribution plane for hacked materials.
我们是按服务条款做的，所有人注册推特时都同意的。这是关于发布骇客来的内容的条款。我们不希望推特成为发布骇客来的内容的平台。

Cornyn:
You do realize, by taking down that story, probably gave it more prominence, more visibility than it would have gotten had you left it alone.
你发现吗，下架那个报道，相比如果你不动它，你可能给它更多关注更显眼。

Dorsey:
We realized that. We recognize it as a mistake we made, both in terms of the intention of policy, and also the enforcement action of not allowing people to share it publicly or privately, which is why we corrected it within 24 hours.
我们意识到了，我们意识到我们的错误。根据条款的目的，以及根据不让人们公开或私下分享的执行力。这就是为什么我们24小时内就纠正了。

Cornyn:
And Mr. Dorsey, why isn’t Justice Brandt’s formulation in Whitney vs California? Why shouldn’t that apply to the internet platforms like yours? In order words, the cure for bad speech is not censorship. It’s more speech. Why wouldn’t that principle apply to Twitter?
多西先生，为什么法官Brandt在怀特尼对加州这个案例的公理。为什么那个不适用于像你的这样的互联网平台呢？换句话说，治理说坏话的方法不是审查言论，而是更多言论。为什么那个公理不适用于推特？

Dorsey:
I think it does apply. All of our policies are focused on encouraging more speech. What we saw and what the market told us was that people would not put up with abuse, harassment, and misleading information that will cause harm. And they would leave our service because of it. So our intention is to create clear policy, clear enforcement, and enable people to feel they can express themselves on our service and ultimately trusted.
我认为它适用，我们所有的条款都集中在鼓励更多言论。我们看到的以及市场告诉我们是人们不容忍滥用，骚扰和误导性的信息。这些会造成伤害。因为这个，他们会离开你的服务。我们的目的是创造明确的条款，明确的执行。让人们感到他们可以在我们服务上表达他们自己，并最终相信。

Cornyn:
So it was a business decision?
所以是商业决策？

Dorsey:
It was a business decision.
是商业决策。
