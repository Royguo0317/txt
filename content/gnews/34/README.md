**A brief timeline **

On December 31st, 2019, Dr. Yan, a virologist and a then core team member of *the WHO H5 Reference Laboratory*and *the State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases of China*at the University of Hong Kong School of Public Health, conducted a secret investigation on the outbreak in Wuhan. On Jan 16th, 2020, Dr. Yan conducted a second investigation. On both occasions, Dr. Yan used her personal connections inside China’s research and hospital systems, including PLA laboratories and hospitals, and the CDC. Through communications with them, Dr. Yan learned first-hand information of the emerging COVID-19 disease, including its severity and scale of spread. She also learned how the CCP government was hiding such information from the public, which was deeply worsening the situation. Dr. Yan then gave timely feedback to her supervisors, professors Leo LM Poon and Malik Peiris, who are top coronavirus experts and core consultants of the WHO. She had hoped that certain actions would be taken internationally to pressure the CCP government to act responsibly. However, no such actions took place. Instead, Dr. Yan was warned repeatedly by professor Poon that she “*should not cross the red line*” and, “*if not, would be disappeared*”.

【译】简明的时间线

2019年10月，闫博士那时是一个滤过性病原体学者兼WHO H5参考实验室以及中国新发传染病国家关键实验室核心团队成员，在香港大学公共健康学院进行了一场针对武汉的爆发的秘密调查。在2020年1月16日，闫博士进行了第二次调查。在两次调查中，闫博士都运用了她和包括中国的研究和医疗系统的关系，包括解放军实验室和医院，以及CDC。通过与他们的沟通，闫博士获得了有关COVID-19出现的第一手信息，包括它的严重性和传播广度。她还了解了中共政府是如何对公众隐瞒这些信息的，这令情况严重加剧。闫博士那时定期向她的主管即潘烈文博士和马力克博士做定期信息回馈，他们都是WHO冠状病毒的顶尖科学家和核心顾问。她曾希望能有些国际性行动被采取以迫使中共政府负起责任来。结果，没有这样的行动发生，相反，闫博士不断被潘教授警告“不要越过红线”以及“如果不这么做将被消失”。

At the same time, Dr. Yan also obtained intelligence information about the true identity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus – a bioweapon created by the Chinese military. She then verified this herself by analyzing the genetic information of the virus shared on the database using her own expertise in virology and biology. While chasing the initial sequence information, Dr. Yan also noticed that strange changes were made to the earliest deposited SARS-CoV-2 sequence. The first version of the genomic sequence, which was uploaded on January 12th was strangely mistaken. It was then quickly withdrawn and replaced by the second version (MN908947.2) on Jan 14th, which was largely correct. It is noteworthy that, on January 13th, Thailand reported the first case of infection outside China, which entails that sequence information would be obtained by the outside world and no longer under the full control of the CCP government. What is also noteworthy is that the first version was not accessible on the database for a long while until it reappeared (MN908947.1), surprisingly, free of the severe errors that it had carried previously. Finally, on January 17th, a third version was uploaded and some missing nucleotides were added to the sequence (MN908947.3). The intelligence information, the genetic evidence, the severity of the disease, and the cover-up by the CCP government convinced Dr. Yan that a public health crisis may be forthcoming.

【译】在同一时间，闫博士也获得了有关新冠身份的情报——它是中国军方制造的生物武器。于是她亲自通过分析数据库里的共享病毒信息，用她的病毒学和生物学专业知识证实了这一点。当追溯原始基因序列信息时，闫博士还注意到新冠基因序列遭到了奇怪的改动。这2020年1月12日上传的序列存在奇怪的错误。它很快被回收而被1月14日的第二个版本（MN908947.2）替代。这个版本大体上正确。值得注意的是1月13日，泰国报告了第一例中国境外感染，它势必导致基因序列信息将被外面的世界所获知而不再完全被中共政府控制。同样值得注意的是，第一个版本很长时间里无法被访问，直到它重新出现（MN908947.1），并令人惊奇地摆脱了之前存在的严重错误。最后，1月17日，第三个版本被上传，一些缺失的核苷酸被补入序列（MN908947.3）。情报、基因证据、疾病的严重性和中国政府的掩盖让闫博士确信公共健康危机迫在眉睫。

This great sense of urgency compelled Dr. Yan to seek alternative avenues to let this information go out to the public. Her hope was, once again, to alert the world and trigger certain international pressure to make the CCP government act responsibly, which may then prevent a global health crisis. On Jan 19th, 2020, she anonymously shared this information on the *LUDE Media*, a YouTube channel that broadcasts to a great Chinese audience both inside and outside mainland China. In this broadcast10, Dr. Yan sent the following five messages:

• The virus was created in a PLA laboratory using ZC45/ZXC21 as the template.

• The CCP government is actively covering up the true information of the disease.

• There is human-to-human transmission.

• There are no wild animal intermediate hosts, and the Huanan seafood market is not the origin of the virus.

• If not controlled immediately, the virus may lead to a pandemic and, as a result, many mutants will emerge inevitably and rapidly.

【译】这种急迫感迫使闫博士急需寻找替代途径把信息传递给公众。她希望再一次警告世界并给中共政府带来一定压力令其负起责任，那也许能阻止全球健康危机。2020年1月19日，她化名把这一信息分享给路德社，一个油管上的频道，它对海内外很多中国听众进行广播。在广播中闫博士发出以下信息：

病毒是解放军实验室用ZC45/ZXC21为模板制造

中共政府有意隐瞒疾病的真相

（疾病）能够人传人

不存在野生动物中间宿主，武汉海鲜市场不是病毒起源

如果不马上加以控制，病毒将导致大流行，结果会不可避免出现许多变异

*The red line had been crossed*. Dr. Yan knew very well then that her actions could lead to severe consequences in her personal safety. If her identity was revealed, she could be “disappeared”, just like what happened to thousands of Hong Kong youths during the pro-democracy protests since June 2019. Dr. Yan did it anyways.

The effect of Dr. Yan messages was immediate and significant. The CCP government was shocked by the substantial truth in Dr. Yan’s messages; it was afraid that this anonymous insider was going to expose more of its lies. With its original plans disrupted, the CCP government reacted in a hurry:

• Four hours after *LUDE Media*’s broadcast, the CCP government tripled their official number of infections, increasing it from 62 to 198.

• A few hours later, the CCP government reported, for the first time, infections outside of Wuhan.

• It also made a nation-wide announcement elevating the infectious disease alertness to the highest level according to the *Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases*.

• Within one day, the CCP government admitted for the first time that there was human-to-human transmission.

• Three days later, Wuhan was put into lockdown.

【译】红线已经越过，闫博士很清楚她的行动将导致自身安全的严重后果。如果她的身份暴露，她将被消失，就像发生在2019年6月以来那些香港反送中运动中的人身上的那样，但闫博士还是做了。闫博士的讯息的效果是巨大而及时的。中共政府震惊于闫博士讯息中确实的真相，他们立即采取了以下行动：

在路德节目播出后四小时，中共把他们公布的感染人数增加了三倍，62变198

几小时后，中共政府第一次报告了武汉之外的感染

它还对全国宣布把传染病警报等级升至最高

同一天，中共政府承认人传人

三天后，武汉封城

At the same time, the scientific field has been mobilized. In China, Dr. Zhengli Shi, the *batwoman*from the Wuhan Institutes of Virology (WIV), hurried out a *Nature*publication (submitted on January 20th and published on February 3rd, 2020)11, where she reported a RaTG13 bat coronavirus sharing a 96.2% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2. Since then, this RaTG13 virus has served as the founding evidence for the natural origin theory (this publication of Shi has been accessed over 1.11 million times and cited 5431 times by March 30th, 2021). Interestingly, in the same issue of *Nature*, a similar article was published by Dr. Yongzhen Zhang12, which described ZC45 and ZXC21 as the closest match to SARS-CoV-2 evolutionarily. However, Dr. Zhang’s publication received much less attention (0.47 million accesses and 2588 citations by March 30th, 2021). On February 8th, 2020, Major General and bioweapon expert Dr. Wei Chen took over

the leadership of the WIV. Furthermore, a compulsory regulation was put into place

demanding that all manuscripts concerning SARS-CoV-2 research produced by Chinese laboratories must be first reviewed and approved by the CCP government before being submitted for publication.

【译】同一时间，科学界被动员起来。在中国，石正丽博士（武汉病毒所的蝙蝠女）急忙在《自然》杂志上发表（2020年1月20日、2月3日）文章，报告说RaTG13蝙蝠病毒与新冠基因有96.2%的相似度。从那以后，RaTG13就充当了自然起源理论的基础证据（到2021年3月30日，石发表的文章被访问超过一百一十万次，引用543次）。有趣的是同一时间在《自然》杂志上张永振教授发表了类似文章，认为ZC45/ZXC21与新冠最为接近。张博士的发表获得了较少的关注（47万次访问和2588次引用）。2020年2月8日，少将兼生物武器专家陈薇接管了武汉病毒研究所，更进一步的是，一项强制性规定被实施，要求所有中国实验室与新冠有关的研究稿件必须首先被中共政府审查批准才能发表。
