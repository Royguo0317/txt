英文標題 CCP Virus Pandemic Updates Ep231: A No. 1 Middle School gave students moldy vegetables and rotten meat;

視頻重點

1. 9月11日，哈爾濱依蘭縣境內一堤壩潰壩。全網搜索國內相關新聞，只能找到官媒新華網的一篇總計139字的免責聲明似的報導。另有一篇文章報導（該文章已經被刪除）說，“該堤壩能抵禦10年一遇的洪水”，而官方說“此次的洪水是15年一遇的，所以潰壩了”。
2. 雲南威信一中食堂給學生吃發霉變質的蔬菜和肉類；有家長爆料說該食堂是縣委書記老丈人承包，官媒發文謊稱該事件屬謠言。
3. 宜賓一24歲男子，因不滿鐘南山在疫情期間給百姓提供大量錯誤的防疫指導，直接導致大量中國人無辜死亡，在朋友圈發文抨擊鐘南山；卻因言獲罪，遭到逮捕;
4. 香港太子洗衣街運動場道體育館旁，一女子被幾名男子強行抓上黑色轎車，整個過程該女士不停地大喊救命。
5. （9/11）接下來，中國人如果不趕快聯合起來滅共的話，共產黨讓中國人死的，絕對不是一千萬人，也不會是一億人。你想再像過去文化大革命似的死一億人，那你是做夢呢。


1. September 11 , a dam broke in Yilan County, Harbin. When trying to search for related news on all available websites, only one report on Xinhuanet was found with a 139-word disclaimer. In another article which has been deleted, it reported that the dam was prepared to withstand the once-in-10-year flood, and the official said this flood was once in 15 years, therefore the dam failed.
2. The canteen of Yunnan Weixin No. 1 Middle School gave students moldy vegetables and rotten meat; some parents broke the news that the canteen was contracted by the father-in-law of the county party secretary, and the official media lied that the incident was a rumor.
3. A 24-year-old man from Yibin was arrested after he posted criticism within his circle of friends, displaying his dissatisfaction with Zhong Nanshan’s misguidance to contain the epidemic, holding him responsible for the high death toll in China.
4. In a Hong Kong stadium near Prince Edward Station, a woman kept screaming and calling for help after being kidnapped by several men, who forced her into a black car.
5. (9/11) Next, for Chinese people if we don’t unite and take down the CCP fast enough, the CCP won’t just kill 10 million or even 100 million. If you think it will be the same as the Cultural Revolution, with around 100 million people killed, you are dreaming.
