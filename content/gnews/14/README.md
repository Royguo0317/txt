**中国建设、中芯国际、中海油和国际工程咨询公司将被列入制裁名单**

CSCEC, SMIC, CNOOC, and CIECC will be added to the sanctions list.

CSCEC: China State Construction Engineering Corporation,

SMIC: Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation,

CNOOC: China National Offshore Oil Corporation,

CIECC: China International Engineering Consulting Corporation.

川普即将制裁的这四家军方实际控制的公司，分别是中共最大建筑商、最大芯片公司、最大海上石油公司和负责中共所有海外项目的咨询公司，这批制裁将对中共芯片业和海外项目造成毁灭性打击。

These four actual military-controlled corporations that will be sanctioned by Trump are the CCP’s largest builder, largest chip company, largest offshore oil company, and the consulting corporation responsible for all of the CCP’s overseas projects. These sanctions will deal a devastating blow to the CCP’s chip industry and overseas projects.

**灭共，川普这次玩真的了**

**This time Trump is really playing to exterminate the Chinese Communist Party.**

这四家巨无霸公司，每一家规模都比华为大很多，是中共海外扩张的最精锐力量，因此这批制裁是真正打到中共的痛处。这四家公司，每家背后都是华尔街在站台，其建设资金都主要来自华尔街，此次制裁将彻底掐断华尔街的输血管道。

这批制裁名单的出台后，所有主流媒体都很安静，表明华尔街背后的利益集团早就做过评估，清楚将发生什么，且已经与川普政府达成一致。川普灭共这次当真了。

These four giant corporations, each much larger than Huawei, are the most elite forces in the CCP’s overseas expansion, so the sanctions are a real shot in the arm for the CCP. Each of these four corporations is backed and funded primarily by Wall Street, thus the sanctions will completely cut off their vascular access to capital from Wall Street.

After the sanctions list was released, all mainstream media kept quiet, indicating that the interest groups behind Wall Street had already made an assessment, knew exactly what would happen, and had reached an agreement with the Trump administration. This time, Trump is serious about exterminating the Communist Party.

**中共船务和机组人员被美国盘查**

**The CCP sea and aircraft crews are interrogated by the United States.**

中国日报报道：截止11月11日有中共21艘轮船在美停靠时遭到突击检查，9月以来有16架次航班机组人员遭问讯和盘查是否党员身份及入党原因，时间有时长达数小时。但中国日报没有报道的是：此次盘查依据来自情报，盘查范围还包括手机和电脑，盘问内容与大选舞弊和投毒有关。

China Daily reports: As of November 11, 21 Chinese Communist Party vessels were suddenly inspected while docked in the U.S., and since September the crews of 16 flights have been interrogated and questioned, sometimes for several hours, about their membership and reasons for joining the CCP. What the China Daily did not report was that the interrogations which related to election fraud and virus casting were based on intelligence and the inspection also includes cell phones and computers.

**乔治亚州法官命令连续两次反转**

**The Georgia judge’s order flipped twice consecutively.**

11月29日，州法官发布紧急命令，要求所有投票机保持现有状态，不得清洗和重置。一个小时后，法官以郡县投票机不属于被告管辖为由，撤销了该命令；林伍德立即将该郡县长加入被告名单，法官不得不再次发布命令，冻结该州三个县的投票机10天。

On November 29, a state judge issued an emergency order requiring all voting machines to remain in their current condition and not be erased or reset. An hour later, the judge reversed the order on the grounds that county voting machines were not within the defendants’ jurisdiction; Lin wood immediately added the county sheriff to the list of defendants, and the judge had to issue another order freezing voting machines in three counties in the state for 10 days.

**从法官命令反转看川普团队必胜**

**Judging by the reversal of the judge’s order, Trump Team will win.**

在美国被渗透如此严重的情况下， 法律体系仍然在有效运转，美国必将再次伟大；

能够被收买的法官，业务能力都不强，远不是大律师的对手；

川普团队的林伍德大律师对法律的熟练运用和应变速度令人称奇，这是推特公司都胆怯、不敢封杀的原因；

民主党腐败的官僚体系，注定了其聘请的500名律师无法与川普团队有真材实料的实干型大律师竞争，从而出现了目前法律战一边倒的现象。

With the United States so heavily infiltrated, the legal system is still working effectively, so America will be great again.

Judges who can be bribed are not very good at their profession and are far from being a match for big lawyers.

Barrister Linwood, a member of the Trump team, his proficiency and responsiveness to the law is amazing, which is why Twitter is timid and afraid to block him.

The Democratic Party’s corrupt bureaucracy has doomed its 500 hired attorneys to be unable to compete with Trump’s team of real-talented, hands-on barristers, resulting in the current lopsided legal battle.

**路德金句：**

LuDe Golden Words：

美国的法官腐败很严重，竞选背后都有资金支持，有些法官的业务能力并不行，包括对法律的掌握程度，法庭上的经验和策略，这才是法官竞争的核心。

行有行规，门有门道，有些法条专门是对法官的监督，就是为了防止某些人只研究一种法律，其实不同种类法律之间互相都有关联和对应，这就是一个牛的法律体系的伟大之处。

Judges in the United States are very corrupt, and there is financial support behind the judges’ campaigns, and some judges are not competent in terms of their professional abilities, including mastery of the law, experience and strategy in the courtroom, which is the core of the competition for judges.

There are rules of the road and door, and some laws are specifically designed to supervise judges to prevent them from studying only one kind of law. In fact, there are correlations and correspondences between different kinds of laws, which is the greatness of an awesome legal system.
