**中共国2020年出生人口不足700万  美国吸引全世界青年人才**

**There Were Less Than 7 Million Babies Born in China in 2020!**

昨天晚上谈的最多的是王保安作为「原」统计局局长被抓。当时我「还」介绍了很多我的哥们儿加入了统计局。统计局最大利益来源是什么呢？出售数据。像纽约的布隆伯格一年「数据上」就几十亿，上百亿美元。全人类所有的所谓投资家都按照关于中国的财务数据、出口数据、人口数据、统计数据「为依据」，全以它为法定单位。就像西方的穆迪一样，比穆迪还牛。这些统计局的哥们儿就是玩这生意的。

What we talked about the most last night was the arrest of Wang Baoan who was the former head of the National Bureau of Statistics of China. I introduced many of my buddies to join the Bureau of Statistics back then. What is the biggest source of profit for the Bureau of Statistics? By selling data. For example, Bloomberg in New York makes billions, tens of billions of dollars a year by selling data. All investors all over the world use the Bureau’s data as official numbers to analyze China’s financial data, export data, population data, and statistical data. Just like Moody’s Analytics in the West, but better than Moody’s. These people from the Bureau of Statistics are in this business.

可悲的是什么呀？可悲的是他们本人现在都是受害者。老天爷是有报应的。

The sad thing is that they are all victims now. There is karma in life.

比如今年「统计报」出了2020年中国新出生婴儿1200万。咱们内部的一位姐妹告诉我说：“7哥，你知道「吗」？实际上中国2020年出生不多于700万，领导决定「往上」报860万。结果领导的大领导 –常委级别– 说：‘不对吧？数据有问题吧？怎么也得1000万啊。’最后研究「完，报了」1200万。”想一想一个这么大的中国，新出生婴儿「仅不到」700万。

For example, this year, the Bureau of Statistics reported that there were 12 million newborn babies in China in 2020. A sister-in-arms who is an insider told me, “In fact, Brother Miles, there were less than 7 million babies born in China in 2020. Our boss decided to report 8.6 million. In the end, the boss of my boss, who is at the level of CCP’s Standing Committee, said: ‘this cannot be right. Is there a problem with the data? There must be at least 10 million.’ Finally, after further review, the Bureau of Statistics reported 12 million.” Think about the fact that there were less than 7 million newborn babies in such a big country like China.

未来共产党「控制中国人」奴隶的最可怕的也是最大的经济来源 — “子宫经济”，我老说是“子宫经济”，切除子宫的经济，断子绝孙的 — 也是我们的农民工经济。

The “womb economy” is the most terrifying and the largest source of income for the CCP as it enslaves the future Chinese people. I always talk that the “womb economy,” the economy to “resect people’s uterus”, and the economy to make people die without progeny, which is also known as the “migrant worker economy”.

我家连农民工都不是，地也没有。很多咱们「战友」是农民工的家人。

BTW, my family was not even qualified as migrant workers because they had no land back then. Many of our fellow fighters are the families of migrant workers.

农民工过去平均二十几岁，25岁、29岁、33岁，到去年变成了47岁。一亿多农民工是共产党奴役所有中国人民的根本基础，一亿多不到两亿「农民工」。现在这些人已经平均40几岁了，还干得动活儿吗？还「能」被剥削「多少」吗？剪羊毛可以，羊都变成老羊了，「还能」长出羊毛吗？「也」只能吃它的骨头，扒它的筋了。

The average age of migrant workers used to be in the mid-twenties. It has increased from 25 years old, to 29, 33, then to 47 years old last year. Between 100 million and 200 million migrant workers are the foundation that the CCP uses to enslave all Chinese people. But these people are now in their 40s on average. Can they still work? Can they continue to be exploited? It’s okay to shear the sheep. But when the sheep become old, can they still grow wool? Maybe there will only be bones and tendons left for the CCP to eat.

中国老年化「问题」我从2017年就「跟」大家说「过」，中国老年化进程最后「会」让中国「和」中华民族一文不值，成为世界上一个等待死亡的国家。那时候「还」什么“爹亲、娘亲不如党亲”？共产党「自己」都是一帮老杂毛「了」。这是为什么它要「搞」“建筑艺术项目”，搞这么多生殖器「关系」养这么多私生子女。大家一定看到这个本质，这个话题大家走着看。

I have told you about China’s aging problem since 2017. China’s aging process will eventually make China and the Chinese nation worthless and lead it to become a country waiting to die. When the time comes, who will care about whether “the party is dearer than your own father and mother”? There will be only a bunch of old bastards left in the CCP. That’s why the CCP employed the so-called “Architectural Art Project” (AAP is a CCP’s project that records illegitimate children of high level CCP officials and provides them with unique codes; and children that involve artificial insemination), to engage in so many genital relations and raise so many illegitimate children. Everybody must see the essence of the matter. Let’s wait and see how this develops.

美国把世界上最年轻，最有智慧的源源不断的人才吸引到美国。人家直接不用生，也不用老盯着“子宫”，也不搞什么计划生育 — 「管」你多生几个，「还是」少生几个的。全世界生完「的」孩子都整成型的（培养成才了）的送来「到美国」。美国的超市里买的饭回家直接做着吃就行了，不像「在」中共国还得到菜地里拔完「菜」，洗完以后，再整完去吃。

The United States attracts a steady stream of the world’s youngest and most brilliant talents. They don’t need to think about fertility, they don’t have to stare at people’s “wombs,” and they don’t engage in family planning. It doesn’t matter whether you have more or fewer births. Children worldwide who have grown up to become talented all want to go to the United States. Just like the food in American supermarkets that you buy, you can cook it at home and eat it directly. Unlike in communist China where you have to go to the vegetable field to pull out the vegetables, wash them, cook them, then eat.

「美国」这个国家能不强大吗？这个国家的后代越「来越」强大，后代的基因越来越国际化，而且越来越多的世界精英到这儿来，它能不强大吗？

So how can the United States as a country not be strong? The offsprings of this country are getting stronger and stronger, the genes of the offsprings are getting more and more internationalized, and more and more world elites are coming here. How can the country not be strong?

你看中共：人老了，人死了，人不生了，人吃的有毒的东西，然后钱挣了钱「又」没了，任何科技发明没有「还」天天搞文化大革命……谁但凡长点正常脑子的「就得被」弄死。

Let’s look at the CCP on the other hand: People are getting older. People are dying. People are no longer giving births. People are eating poisonous food. The money that the Lao Bai Xing (ordinary people) have made is gone. There is no scientific and technological invention in the whole country, but the Cultural Revolution is being carried out every day. Whoever has a normal brain will be killed.
