- 中文简介： 天空新闻主持人和嘉宾：事实上，中共政权的最大受害者是中共国人—如果他们说任何反对政府的话，就会被关进监狱。澳大利亚人明白这里大多数中共国人后裔与中共政权完全没有关係，大部分澳大利亚人能够区分政权和个人。
- 英文标题：Chinese people are the ‘biggest victim’ of the Chinese communist regime.
- 英文简介：“In fact the biggest victims of the Chinese Communist regime are Chinese people – they’re the ones who get locked up if they say anything against their government. Australians know very well that most people of Chinese descent who are here have got absolutely nothing to do with the Chinese communist regime, most Australians can distinguish between the regime and the individua,” Sky News host and guests said.
