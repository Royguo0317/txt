**The Wuhan Laboratory Origin of SARS-CoV-2** **and the Validity of the Yan Reports Are Further Proved by the Failure of Two Uninvited “Peer Reviews”**

**【译】两篇不请自来的同行评议进一步证实了新冠来源于武汉实验室，以及闫博士报告的正确性**

**Opening Statement**

A year has passed since the COVID-19 pandemic first started. Its damage so far is astonishing: 127 million people have been infected and, among them, 2.78 million died. These numbers continue to grow at a significant speed, indicating that the pandemic is far from being over. Furthermore, mutant viral strains continue to emerge, and no public policies or treatment strategies seem to be sufficiently effective in blocking COVID-19. There seems to be a consensus that the virus will not be eradicated and humans will continue to live under the influence of COVID-19 in the foreseeable future.

【译】开场白

自从新冠大流行开始，已经过去了一年。迄今为止它的破坏是惊人的：1.27亿人感染，超过278万人死亡。这些数字继续以极快的速度增长，说明达流行离结束尚远。另外，变异的病毒株继续出现，而在阻止新冠方面似乎没有足够有效的公共政策或处理战略。似乎有一种舆论，病毒不会被根除，而人类未来将继续生活在新冠的影响之下。

The defeat of humans by COVID-19 is for two fundamental reasons. First, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is not a naturally occurring pathogen but an *Unrestricted Bioweapon*. It has designed and significantly enhanced functions and therefore could not be controlled easily using strategies that would normally work for naturally occurring pathogens. It is a product of the bioweapons program of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) government, the network of which includes not only the CCP scientists but also certain overseas scientists and organizations. SARS-CoV-2 was created based on template viruses ZC45 and ZXC21, which were originally discovered in bats by scientists of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The subsequent laboratory modifications had enabled its ability to infect humans as well as had enhanced the virus in its pathogenicity, transmissibility, and lethality.

【译】人类被新冠重创有两个原因：第一，新冠COVID-19的病原体，不是自然出现的病原体，而是“超限生物武器”。它经过设计并且功能显著增强，因此不可能被轻易地以通常对付自然出现的病原体的有效战略所控制。它是中共CCP政府生物武器计划的产物，该计划网络不仅包括了中共科学家，也包括了部分海外科学家和组织。新冠是以ZC45/ZXC21为模板制造出来的，ZC45/ZXC21最初为中共军方科学家在蝙蝠体内发现，随后的实验室改造使其具备了感染人的能力，同时增强了该病毒的感染力和杀伤力。

The second fundamental reason of our defeat was that the world was made to look away from the true nature of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore responded inadequately on multiple aspects and occasions. A massive misinformation campaign has been undertaken by the CCP government to cover up the true origin of SARS-CoV-2, which involved destroying data and samples, publishing fabricated viruses on top scientific journals, controlling the narrative of the origin debate through bribed top scientists and organizations, amplifying the falsified natural origin theory through media control, labeling all other origin theories as “conspiracy theories”, and defaming individuals who reveal the truth of SARS-CoV-2. As a result of the CCP’s efforts here, the true, weaponized nature of SARS-CoV-2 has been obscured and was not known by most of the public.

One example of the CCP’s misinformation campaign is the defamation of the Yan reports.

【译】我们失败的第二个根本原因是全世界被从新冠真相上引开，因此在许多方面和许多时候做出了不充分的回应。中共政府一直在实施一场庞大的信息误导运动以掩盖新冠起源的真相。这场运动包括销毁数据和样本，在顶级科学杂志上发表各种伪造的病毒，通过贿赂顶尖科学家和组织来限制对起源的讨论，通过控制媒体鼓吹虚假的自然起源理论，给其他起源说贴上“阴谋论”的标签，诽谤那些揭露新冠真相的个人。作为中共努力的结果，真相，即新冠是生物武器，被模糊了，不为大众所知晓。

中共信息误导运动的一个例证就是对闫博士报告的诽谤。

On September 14th, 2020, we published our first report1, where we provided abundant scientific evidence and analyses proving that SARS-CoV-2 must not be a product of natural evolution but a product of laboratory creation. We also postulated/reconstructed, based on substantial literature evidence, a pathway for the convenient laboratory creation of SARS-CoV-2. On October 8th, 2020, we published our second report2, where we used scientific evidence and logical analyses to uncover a large-scale, organized scientific fraud committed by the CCP laboratories and orchestrated by the CCP government. This fraud clearly indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is not a natural occurring virus or a simple gain-of-function product that accidentally leaked out from a laboratory. Rather, it must be a deceiving, non-traditional bioweapon created by the CCP regime. We also refuted the claim that the virus was derived from a virus from a mine in Mojiang. Furthermore, the fact that certain fabrications preceded the initial outbreak of COVID-19 suggests that the release of the SARS-CoV-2 must be intentional.

【译】在2020年9月14日，我们发表了第一篇报告，于报告中我们提供了丰富的科学证据和分析证明新冠一定不是自然演变的产物，而是实验室制造的结果。基于丰富的文献资料，我们也假设和重建了一种便利的实验室制造新冠的流程。在2020年10月我们发表了第二篇报告，于其中我们以科学证据和逻辑分析揭露了一场大范围有组织的科学造假，那是由中共实验室实施和由中共政府协调组织的。这种造假清楚地显示了新冠不是自然界出现的病毒，或实验室泄露的简单的功能获得性产品。实际上，它是一场骗局，是中共政府制造的非传统性生物武器。我们还驳斥了声称病毒来源于云南矿洞的说法。另外，实际上在COVID-19爆发之初进一步出现的几项造假说明，新冠的散布一定是国际性的。

Our two reports were published on *zenodo.org*as preprint articles. We chose this site and this format because we were fully aware of the censorship on the laboratory origin of SARS-CoV-2 imposed by the top scientists of the field – peer review would not allow our report to be published as it is in a timely manner or at all. The transparency and expedited publication process offered by z*enodo*, however, were necessary and appropriate in this situation – Dr. Yan and the rest of us wanted the truth of SARS-CoV-2 to be known by the rest of the world as early as possible. Furthermore, peer review is not a guarantee for scientific quality or truthfulness3-7, which is a view shared by many experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci.

【译】我们的两篇报告作为预印本（一个开放的科学平台）文章发表在zenodo.org上。我们选择此一网站和此一形式是因为我们很清楚由这一领域的顶级科学家施加的对新冠实验室起源学说的言论审查——同行评议不允许我们的报告原原本本地发表，短期以及完全（不允许）。Zenodo提供的透明度和通畅的发表流程，在这种情况下怎么说都是必要的和适当的——闫博士和我们其他人渴望新冠的真相被全世界尽早了解。另外，同行评议并不是科学品质和真实性的保证，这是许多科学家的共识，包括福奇博士。

After the publication of our first report, within ten days, two uninvited “peer reviews” were published8,9. As shown in the rest of the document, these reviews were completely mistaken and intentionally misleading. However, they were published on well-known platforms and were produced by “reviewers” who hold high academic titles and are affiliated with prestigious institutions. It was a fine display of the status of personnel and organizations engaged in the CCP’s scientific misinformation.

However, before diving into details of these “peer reviews”, let us travel back in time and take a quick tour to review Dr. Yan’s journey since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as some early events in the origin “debate”.

【译】在我们第一篇报告发表后，在十天里，两篇同行评议不请自来地发表了。如本文后面所述，这些评议是完全错误的和具有国际性误导性的。可是无论如何，它们发表在知名的平台且由具有很高学术头衔并隶属权威机构的评议家写就，这很好地展示了卷入中共的科学信息误导（战略）的那些个人和机构的状况。

在深入探讨这些同行评议之前，好歹让我们回溯时间做一个缩略旅行，来回顾闫博士自从COVID-19大流行爆发后的经历，以及关于（病毒）起源的争议的一些早期事件。

（未完待续）
