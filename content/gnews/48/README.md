简述：在2021年3月21日的盖特中，郭先生第一次披露了中美阿拉斯加会谈的本质 —— 那是一出戏！中共的王毅和杨洁篪是披着狼皮的羊，而美方是披着羊皮的狼，他们之所以这样演是因为，中共可以继续骗14亿老百姓，而美方也可以满足私利，而最后买单的则是中国14亿草根老百姓，不信就等着瞧。

**中美阿拉斯加会谈是披着羊皮的狼和披着羊皮的狼演的一出戏**

**The US-China Alaska Meeting Is a Show**

咱这个先不多说，咱再说说更夸张的。这几天都在说的是，所有的阿拉斯加，中美两国会谈，只有咱们一家说这是演戏，没有任何人知道演戏，因为咱知道情报，那不是瞎蒙的，你老蒙的那是永远不可能100%准确的，是吧？只有咱一家说出这是演戏。这几天很多有良知的所谓的媒体人，还有政客们跟七哥开会都快疯了，[问]“为什么 Miles 你能知道这是在演戏呢？”很简单兄弟姐妹们，我说看这个演戏，我给他们形容了一个，我说：“中共国假擀面杖子经济，假的吹牛，我说它就像一个什么？”

Let’s just move on and talk about something more absurd. All that people have been talking about these days was the Alaska meeting between the US and China. We are the only one saying that it was a show. No one else knew about this. It’s because we have the intelligence, so we are not taking a shot in the dark. If you guess blindly, you will never be 100% correct, right? We are the only media who said it was a show. In these days, many so-called media professionals with conscience along with politicians have had meetings with me like crazy, asking “How do you know it was a show, Miles?” It is very simple, brothers and sisters. I said, “Look, this is a show.” Then I made a metaphor, “What do the ‘rolling pin’ (fake) economy of the CCP and their boastings look like?”

我说：你去想想中共国的经济、军事，所有的实力跟美国比，它真的就是一个羊，这没办法。那么美国在世界上军事、政治、经济、技术、影响力，它绝对是个狼。咱用这这两个动物来讲。那么中共国今天为啥敢这么嚣张？中共敢这么嚣张，因为它手里边它绑架到14亿中国人民，还有一个它在美国有蓝金黄，它就是14亿奴隶和蓝金黄手段，所笼络的资源，不就这个吗？是吧？兄弟姐妹们，还有啥可说的，不就这两招儿吗？

I said, think about the economic and military strength of the CCP, when compared to the US, it is like a sheep, with no doubt. Considering the strength and influence of military, politics, economy, and technology, the US is absolutely a wolf. Let’s use these two animals to tell the story. Then, why dare the CCP to be so arrogant? It is because the CCP has kidnapped 1.4 billion Chinese people. Another reason is the BGY plot in the US, using all the resources netted by abusing the 1.4 billion slaves. Right? Brothers and sisters, what else can I say? The CCP only has only these two tricks, right?

我说那为什么中美阿拉斯加峰会成这样的滑稽的场面？很多欧美人问我：你怎么看这件事情。我说：非常简单，看中共和美国这两个峰会，我有两个比喻。中共所谓的杨娘娘，还有王公公就是一个披着羊皮的羊，披着羊皮的羊它还是羊，咋呼得很厉害，左顾右盼、前看后看，在那又蹬腿又挠地的，“啪啪啪”它把它自己当成了狼了。

I then asked, “Why did the US-China Alaska meeting have such an absurd scene?” Many people from Europe and America asked me, “What’s your take on this?” I said, “It was very simple. I can use two metaphors to describe the meetings between the CCP and the US. The so-called Empress Yang (Jiechi Yang) and Eunuch Wang (Yi Wang) were sheep covered with the skin of a wolf. Sheep in wolf’s clothing are still sheep no matter how much fuss they make, how they check around, look back and forth, kick and scratch the ground, or how much they believe they are a wolf.”

我说美国那是什么呢？是披着羊皮的狼，是披着羊皮的狼，完了。他为啥？它真把自己当羊了。为什么美国这个狼要把自己披着羊皮呢？因为美国有弱点，美国不敢当狼，因为这个羊跟它之间有默契，要让它当一次羊，因为回到中共国去好骗那14亿的奴隶。咱俩演戏，然后我这个羊，穿着羊皮的咋呼的羊，要开始给你多送点羊过来，或者在美国弄点狼肉吃吃。就这么简单。

I continued, “Then what was America like? It was a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Period. Why? It indeed treated itself as a sheep. Why was America the wolf willing to put on sheep’s clothing? It’s because others got goods on America, so that it didn’t have the courage to be a wolf. It’s because the sheep had a tacit agreement with it and asked it to pretend to be a sheep for once, in order to cheat the 1.4 billion slaves in Communist China. So, if you America agreed to put on a show with me, I, the noisy sheep in wolf’s clothing would send more sheep to you or even some other wolf’s meat for you America to eat.”

我说：最终，一定要记住，美国狼还会回到本质，美国的狼还会是披着狼皮的狼，中共国还是披着羊皮的羊，或者被扒了皮的羊，就这么简单。他们都爱笑死了。

“Simple as this,” I said, “ultimately, please remember, the America wolf will go back to its nature. The American wolf will turn back to a wolf in wolf’s skin, and the CCP sheep will still be a sheep in sheep’s skin or naked with its skin peeled. That’s it.” They all laughed.

不管你咋咋呼，你都是披着羊皮的羊。所以说，我说：他越咋呼越好，他对香港对台湾以及到非洲、中东，玩的这一切手段都是政治手段，一切都是为内政，一切都是内政。好好看看第二次世界大战，希特勒，当时的法国、英国，包括日本，很多重大的影响国家命运的决策，当时都和内政，内部政治有绝对的关系，这全世界的政治都是一家的，都是流氓。但是中共国不是流氓，它是真正的黑社会，它是绑架14亿中国人民的，它是以14亿人民作为筹码跟全世界讲数的。美国人愿意，知道自己是狼，还披着羊皮，就是更为了获取个人获得更多的羊肉，为个人获得更多的羊肉，和未来吃更多的羊崽子，甚至吃个羊胎盘啥的，是吧？就这么简单。

No matter how loud you voiced, you are still a sheep in sheep’s skin. So, I said, “It is better if they keep making more fuss. All means the CCP has used toward Hong Kong, Taiwan, Africa, and the Middle East are political tactics for its domestic politics. Please take a good look at WWII. Many critical decisions that influenced a nation’s fate made by Hitler, France, the UK, or Japan at that time were absolutely connected with their domestic politics. All the world’s politicians belong to the same family – they are all rogues. Yet, the CCP is not a rogue, rather, it is a true gangsterdom. It has kidnapped 1.4 billion Chinese and used the 1.4 billion Chinese as leverage to bargain with the world. The Americans were willing to put on sheep’s clothing, even though they knew they were wolves, because they wanted to get more sheep meat for their personal interest and get more lambs for the future, or even get some sheep placentas to eat, right? Simple as this.”

但是美国这次是被羞辱的，中共这次是咋咋呼呼的解决了内部的上海邦和习大神的问题，更重要的事情最后是剪韭菜，最后买单的是咱中国老百姓。两边，不管是狼披羊皮，还是羊披羊皮，但最后买单的就咱中国老百姓，草根。就这么简单，信不信？不信拉倒。

America was humiliated this time, and the noisy CCP has solved its internal conflict between the Shanghai Gang and God Xi. More importantly, the CCP could reach its ultimate goal of harvesting the chives (referring to robbing the ordinary Chinese) and having the ordinary Chinese to pay the bills in the end. No matter to the wolf in sheep’s clothing or the sheep in sheep’s skins, in the end, it is the ordinary Chinese who will pay for the bills, the grassroots. Simple as this. Do you believe me? It doesn’t matter if you don’t.
