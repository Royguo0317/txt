**中国共产党在新加坡的“新共”计划**

**The CCP’s “Communizing Singapore” Plan**

尊敬的战友们好！2月23号，尊敬的战友们好！ 这个你们健身了吗？我就不蹦了啊，蹦得你们眼花缭乱的。很多战友们都在发信息，特别我们新加坡我们农场的战友们，看到这个报道所谓的江志成的江家的博裕资本，移到了新加坡，然后大家觉得是好事，觉得你看江家和习斗，江家跑了，去新加坡了，说明新加坡很好，是吧？这是一种说法。第二个，新加坡还是很安全嘛，江家都去新加坡了，那共产党就不会来了，是吧？

Hello, dear honorable fellow fighters! Today is February 23. Have you worked out? I am not going to jump, to make you feel dazzling. Many fellow fighters, especially those in the farm of Singapore, are sending messages. They saw the report that the so-called Jiang Zhicheng’s or the Jiang family’s Boyu Capital moved to Singapore, and they thought it’s a good news because they thought the battle between Jiang’s Family and Xi being followed by the retreat of Jiang’s family to Singapore would indicate that Singapore is a good place, right? This is one viewpoint. A second viewpoint is that Singapore is very safe because the Jiang family has come to Singapore, so the CCP will not come, right?

我告诉战友们：你们都错了。非常简单，别听七哥的。你看一看所谓的改革开放，也就是文化大革命死人之后，毛家还有邓家争权的时候，香港，香港那时谁去了？战友们？谁去香港了？毛家的所谓的远门女婿，外甥女婿第一个去香港了。第二个就是邓家去了香港，然后还在深圳，是吧？然后就是当时不得势的后来的叶家，当时还有权力的叶家，弄的所谓的情报系统去了香港。当时的几大将军、几大家族都去了香港，后来你就看到香港逐渐地被馋食，逐渐地被消灭。

Let me tell you, my fellow fighters. You are all wrong. It is very simple. You don’t need to listen to me. Please look at the so-called “Reform and Opening-up” policy in history, which was after the mass casualties caused by the Cultural Revolution and when Mao and Deng competed for the throne. Do you know who moved to Hong Kong at that time, my fellow fighters? A distant son-in-law of Mao’s, Mao’s niece’s husband, was the first moving to Hong Kong, and then Deng’s family went to Hong Kong and Shenzhen, right? Then, the Ye family, which was not favored yet still influential then, brought the [CCP’s] intelligence system with them to Hong Kong. Several [PLA’s] generals and families all moved to Hong Kong. And then, you have seen that Hong Kong was gradually eroded and then eliminated.

江家这次去新加坡，两个结果，说明江家的这次斗争，江家占了劣势，没把习干掉。习也做出了承诺，说明习一定是跟江家讲数[谈判]了，像当年似的，“你们家出去发展，弄钱去吧，别在里面内部搞政治了，离我远点儿。”去哪？去新加坡。执行什么命令？就执行叫收回新加坡，把新加坡共产化，简称叫“新共化”。内部的项目的名称叫什么，知道了吗？叫“…岛规”，像大湾区一样，就干到新加坡去了，新加坡就给马来西亚并掉了，还有泰国。叫什么岛规，也就是“新共化”。

The Jiang family’s moving to Singapore has two implications. It indicates that the Jiang family was at a disadvantaged position in the battle with Xi and failed to get rid of him. Xi also made promises, indicating that Xi must have negotiated with the Jiang family, just like what happened in the past. “You, get out of here and make your money. Don’t involve in politics here anymore. Get lost.” Where to go? Singapore. What command to execute? It is called the “taking back Singapore” or “communizing Singapore” plan, in short, “Communize Singapore”. Do you know the name called by the insiders? It is called some island plan. Just like the Greater Bay Area in China, and yet, this time they have extended it to Singapore. Singapore will be merged into Malaysia, along with Thailand. It is called the Island Plan, which is communizing Singapore.

你觉得江家以为跑到新加坡就安全了吗？那就太开玩笑了嘛。江家知道跑到新加坡不安全，你跑到美国也不安全啊。他到新加坡去，就是名义上执行“新共计划”，私下里面保护了自己的财产。另外一个在新加坡把整个马来西亚、泰国，甚至台湾和日本的未来绝大的利益让给了江家，就海外这块利益。当然海外的情报机构，像当年的叶家一样，你得干，活还得干，你的利益也能保，你别掺乎政治，别老在我这折腾了。然后蚂蚁金服可能就会给江家，就让它上市了，他到新加坡就会让它上市了。这是根本，兄弟姐妹们。

Do you think the Jiang family will be safe after going to Singapore? You are kidding me. The Jiang family knows that Singapore is not safe, not even the U.S. They went to Singapore in the name of executing the Communizing Singapore plan, whereas their secret aim is to protect their own property. In addition, Xi has given away most of the overseas interests to the Jiang family, including those in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and even Taiwan and Japan. Of course, your overseas intelligence network, like the Ye family in the old days, needs to work for me. You need to continue to work for me, then your interests will be protected. Don’t get involved in politics and don’t mess up with me anymore. Then, the Ant Group may be given back to the Jiang family and allowed to go public. It will be allowed to be listed in the stock market if they move to Singapore. This is the essence, my brothers and sisters.

估计马云也很快，有可能，小范围的活动一下就出来。这是已经达成了在一月份在北京火拼，大家都没死人，大家都没去青烟袅袅，都没去八宝山报到，然后这是一个妥协的结果。新加坡危也！新加坡会加速被“新共化”，这一定是香港的这种结局。李家的那几个人，什么李显龙，你看他长的那个样，你们生活中没接触他，你接触，他不可能，他跟他爹就不是一个级别的，差距太大，差距太大。

I guess soon Jack Ma will come out and show his face in some small-scale events. An agreement has been reached after their battle in Beijing in January, with no casualties, nobody “reported” to the Babaoshan Crematory. This is the result of compromise. Singapore is in danger!The process of communizing Singapore will be sped up, and Singapore will definitely have the same fate as Hong Kong. Look at the handful people in the Lee family, look at Lee Hsien Loong, with that looking. You don’t know him in real life. If know him in person, you would know that it’s impossible for him to [fight against the CCP]. He is not like his father. There is a huge gap between them, a huge gap.

我的敏感，难受死我了。为什么这样？是昨天抽雪茄了，抽了两根儿雪茄，所以说抱歉啊，兄弟姐妹们。

My allergy. So uncomfortable. Why? I smoked two cigars yesterday. So, I apologize, brothers and sisters!

那么李家这家人，他没人了，后继无人。然后新加坡一向是以汉族人为主，中国人为主，他不可能交给所谓的印尼人、印度人、马来人，不可能的。所以说，最后在心理上、在实力上，基本上一个小指头来对抗一个航空母舰，李家对付中共，最后中共就拿走了。拿走整个这里以后，他就西扩，把马来西亚就干掉了，然后把整个的湾区，就是马六甲海峡的所有的运输进入了新加坡以后，那就被共产党掐了个脖子，这叫第二道国家贸易和国防防线，东南亚就100%控制。李家一定是屈服了，100%屈服的，他没任何选择。经济上、政治上、实力上，都会屈服，还有一个所谓的血统上，这是共产党早就在计划之中。你们去看看李家身边现在围绕他的华人，围着他的所谓的那些马来人，马来人被中共安排的婚姻都结了，巨大的利益在给他们，最后是没选择。所以新加坡加速“新共化”以后，会成为共产党在海外情报、经济的大运作平台。所以说，在新加坡的华人，很快就会遭遇香港的待遇。

So, the Lee family has no wise heirs. Also, Singapore is dominated by the Han people or Chinese decedents, so cannot be handed over to the so-called Indonesians, Indians, or Malaysians. So, in the end, the fight between the Lee family and the CCP is basically like a little finger fighting against an aircraft carrier, both psychologically and in terms of their strength. Ultimately, the CCP will take over Singapore. Then, it will expand to the west to take down Malaysia and control the neck of all the transportations in the Malacca Sea, the whole bay area. It is called the second frontline of national trade and defense. The Southeast Asia will be controlled 100% [by the CCP]. The Lee family will definitely surrender, completely surrender because they have no choice. They will surrender economically and politically because of its strength and also its blood relation. These were all in CCP’s plan long ago. Please do your research on the Chinese surrounding the Lee family and those so-called Malaysians surrounding them. These Malaysians have been compromised by the marriages arranged by the CCP, and they obtained huge interests from it. In the end, they will have no choice. Therefore, after Singapore is communized rapidly, it will become a big platform for the CCP’s overseas operations of intelligence and economy. The Chinese in Singapore will soon be treated like the Hong Kongers.

怎么办？接下来就赶快吧，咱灭共嘛，是不是？新中国联邦才能拯救这一切，让新加坡[是]独立的国家，独立的发展，不要把“新共化”发展下去，这是对新加坡和中国人和全亚洲人的利益保护的最好的方案。这就是七哥所说的世界需要新中国联邦，如果新中国联邦不成功，世界将进入黑暗。现在比较好的就是终极之战，所谓的共产党控制了美国总统大选，一切都在往我们的方向在发展中，有利于我们的方向发展中。对美国的各种威胁已经进激起了众怒，亚洲、欧洲正在和我们全面合作，以毒灭共、以钱灭共的关键中。

What should we do? Next, let’s take down the CCP as soon as possible, right? Only the New Federal State of China (NFSC) can save all, make Singapore an independent country that can develop on its own, and stop the “Communizing Singapore” plan, and this is the best approach to protect the interests of Singapore, Chinese, and all Asian people. This is what I mean by saying that the world needs the NFSC. If the NFSC fails, the world will go into the darkness. The better part is that we are in the ultimate battle, the so-called CCP manipulating the U.S. President Election. Everything is going toward our desired direction, the direction that is advantageous to us. All kinds of threats to the U.S. have triggered the public’s anger. Asia and Europe are now fully cooperating with us – a critical moment in the process of “taking down the CCP by the virus and money”.

我们还有以钱灭共，不要忘了。以钱灭共就是我们很多战友在全世界各国各地，将拥有巨大的财富，当然我们可以合法地、和平地，根据当地的法律，影响当地的政治、经济、军事、媒体部门，让他们知道中共犯下的罪行，例如这次的种族大屠杀。种族大屠杀的事情现在谁能给灭了？灭不了。冠状病毒共产党造的，谁能给掩盖？掩盖不了。那么我们未来大家都有钱了，特别是钱多得花不完的时候，拿出1%来灭共，共产党的历史将被清算，共产党会连根儿被拔起，该人民的钱回归人民，该人民的权利和荣誉回归于人民，该让中国人在世界上得到的尊重，也必须给人民。

Don’t forget that we also have the strategy of “taking down the CCP by money”. It means that many our fellow fighters across the world will possess huge wealth. Of course, we will be able to legally and peacefully influence the local politics, economics, military, and the media according to the local laws, making them aware of the crimes committed by the CCP, for example, the genocide of Uighur. Who can wipe out the evidence of genocide? Nobody. The CCP virus was made by the CCP. Who can cover it up for the CCP? Nobody. So, in the future, when we all have money, especially when we have too much money to spend, we can take out 1% of our money and use it in taking down the CCP. Then the history of the CCP will be liquidated and the CCP will be uprooted. People’s money will be returned to people. The rights and respects deserved by people will be given back to people. And the respect deserved by the Chinese people from the world must be given back to the Chinese people.

像新加坡这种什么“新共计划”，这种王八蛋计划，这是作死计划。什么“新共计划”，说白了就是保护共产党私生子女，所谓的生殖器治国的血脉，千年万年不变色，统治全世界，统治全人类。他大爷来的，能让他成功吗？上天不让他成功，咱也不让他成功，没有人让他成功。但是现在你看他这么作，这么折腾，是好事，绝对是好事，他不仅在作死，更重要的是他能帮我们团结更多的国家和更多的力量，与新中国联邦站在一起。最后李家会整明白的，李家最后知道，跟共产党合作，那只有死路一条，彻底被消灭被同化。只有跟新中国联盟合作，是吧？李显龙此人，不是什么大人物，但也不是个笨蛋，是吧？最起码他爹是李光耀嘛，最后他一定会跟我们合作的，现在没这个能力，也没这个勇气，也没这个见识。

Plans like the “Communizing Singapore” plan, a bastard plan, are plans that will destroy themselves. The so-called “Communizing Singapore” plan, in essence, is to protect the CCP’s illegitimate children. The so-called bloodline of governing the country connected by genitals aims at remaining in power for thousands of years and controlling the whole world and all the human beings. Can this bullshit be allowed to succeed? God will not allow them to succeed. We will not allow them to succeed. Nobody will allow them to succeed. Yet, watching them doing stupid things and acting like this is such a good thing, definitely a good thing. They are not only seeking their own death, but also helping us to unite more countries and forces to stand with the NFSC. Eventually, the Lee family will figure it out and realize that cooperating with the CCP will only lead to a dead end, a complete eradication and assimilation. Working with NFSC is the only way to survive, right? Lee Hsien Loong is not a big figure. Yet, he is not an idiot either, right? After all, he is the son of Lee Kuan Yew. Eventually he will cooperate with us. Now, he doesn’t have the ability, courage, or wisdom.

走得看吧兄弟姐妹们。好事啊。今天说好不重磅，不重磅，但是你们会看到，好事一个一个地过来。以毒灭共、以钱灭共，没有人能挡得住。兄弟姐妹们，多么高的智慧呀这两句话！这两句话拥有多大的含金量啊！任何人听了以后，就觉得太牛了。一个人组织、一个群体、一个国家，一旦失去了正确的方向，和远离了事情的核心，你不会成功的。这就是新中国联邦，永远抓住事情的本质和核心，直奔灭共的……

Let’s wait and see, brothers and sisters. These are good news. As I said, today I will not share any bombshell news, no bombshell news. However, you will see that good news are coming one after another. Taking down the CCP by the virus and taking down the CCP by money are unavoidable, brothers and sisters. How intelligent are these words! How valuable are these two sentences! Anyone who hears these two sentences will agree that they are so awesome. Once an organization, a group, or a country loses its right direction or deviates from the core of the matter, it will be destined to fail. This is how the NFSC always holds onto the core and focuses on taking down the CCP…
