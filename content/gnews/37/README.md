**美国经济一定是灾难！巨大的灾难！**

**The US Economy Is Going to Be a Disaster, a Huge Disaster!**

很多战友们就是[问]关于美国经济、世界的经济。我在直播中、在这里告诉大家 — 美国经济一定是灾难，巨大的灾难！全球经济会进入巨大的灾难！我敢负责任在这儿说。为什么很多战友们现在问我这个事。我说：我没办法回答，我怎么回答你呢？我只能告诉你这将是个巨大的灾难，谁都挡不住，它没有任何选择。

Many fellow fighters are concerned about the US and the world economy. In this video clip, I can tell you that the US economy is going to be a disaster, a huge disaster! And the global economy is going to be a huge disaster too! I can responsibly say it here. Many fellow fighters ask me about this. But it’s very difficult to answer, how can I answer you? I can only tell you that it is going to be a huge disaster. No one can stop it. And there is no other solution.

咱就不在经济上说了啊。那些技术数据你也没必要知道。当你知道是灾难的结果的时候，你还往里冲，那叫侥幸，那叫幻想。你倒多大霉都是活该 — 这是肯定的。

We are not discussing the technical, economic statistics, and you don’t need to know that. But it will be a fluke and a fantasy for you to still rush to invest in the market when you have learned the result will be catastrophic. If so, you don’t deserve any sympathy, no matter how much you will lose – that’s for sure.

我给你们讲两个你们永远不会得到的数据，我给你们说一下。第一个就我了解的这些基金，聪明的这些绝大多数都悄悄地、默默地往外换现金。现金到手以后都不留现金，绝大多数人都换了他相信的数字货币，也就把钱放在空中去了，放在云中去了。还有人真的就买了大量的实体黄金。没有人买钻石的，只有傻子才买钻石呢。

I will tell you about two aspects and data that you will never hear. Let me tell you this. Firstly, most of these funds that I know, the smart ones, are quietly cashing out their holding, but rather than keeping the cash in their hands, the vast majority of them have invested the cash in digital currencies that they trust. It’s like putting money in the air and the cloud, making their money safe. In addition, some funds invested in large quantities of physical gold. Nobody invested in diamonds. Only fools would do that.

另外，让我更加惊讶的是人家是房产能卖就卖，那都是拥有的房产都是你永远不知道的，都是在几千万上亿美元的，30%，40%，打对折就卖。有人都十几套房子，就留两套，[其它]全卖了。房产会暴跌，永远出不去。

Another fact that surprised me more was that they sold as many properties as they could. The properties that you will never know and worth tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, were sold at 30%, 40%, or 50% discounts. Some people who used to own more than a dozen properties only kept two houses and sold the rest. They believe that the real estate market is going to collapse and there might be no chance in future to sell them.

股票更不要提了，能卖就卖，能抵押就做抵押。特别是那些能兑换成贴现的那些股份，能赎出的全赎出 — 就在这两三个月[的动作]。记住我今天的直播Getter。大家这个时候在股票市场你还想赚钱的话，那就真的是自寻死路了。

Not to mention stocks. They sold as many stocks as they could, or mortgaged the stocks as much as possible. Especially those shares that can be redeemed for cash were all sold. All these things happened in the last two or three months. I think you should keep in mind what I have told you in this Getter. Anyone who still wants to make money in the stock market at this point is really guaranteeing financial losses.

你要想押赌什么黄金涨、黄金降，你能押住那个点儿，基本上等于到宇宙中去找亲人那[概率]，那么难。能找着吗？不可能的。你要能找着的话，这个世界就都归你了。不是开玩笑的。所以很多人给我发信息问我的时候，我真没办法说。我咋说呢，兄弟姐妹们？这不是开玩笑的，这不是开玩笑的。

Do you think you can gamble correctly on the ebb or flow of the price of gold? It is like looking for somebody you know in the universe. Do you think it is possible? No way. If you could, the world would be yours. This is no joke. So many questions you asked that I have no idea how to reply. How can I say, brothers and sisters? I am not joking.

特别是我再给兄弟姐妹们说的，美国现在完全印钞票，欧洲很多国家都印钞票。欧洲2/3的国家是资不抵债，像意大利、比利时、希腊，这些国家都[已经]破产个球的了，是不是？还在那儿玩呢？然后最大的，共产党啊，共产党它100%完了。它完了，这个世界的经济会好吗？某些地方会好，某些产业甚至是“穿天猴”似的。[问题是]你能把握得住吗？永远在发战争财，发股票财，真的对普通人来讲，就是到宇宙里找亲人的感觉—不要去想。

In particular, brothers and sisters, I am telling you one more thing: the US is in a situation where it has over-issued (printed) paper money to finance its deficits (monetizing the debt). Many countries in Europe are in the same situation. Two thirds of Europe is insolvent. Countries like Italy, Belgium, Greece are bankrupt, aren’t they? But they are still playing this game of printing money. The largest such economy is the CCP’s, which is 100% going to be over. When the CCP falls, will the world’s economy still be good? Some things can be good. Some industries may even be like a rocket ride to the sky. The question is, can you catch it? Getting rich in a war, getting rich in stocks, is really as impossible for the ordinary person as looking for somebody you know in the universe. You shouldn’t think about these impossibilities.

这几天就天天都太多[这些信息了]。因为我们这个圈子里有个协议，永远不能说出去。我就告诉大家，跟我长期合作的那几个基金，所有人都准备好未来几年到山里活着去。在欧洲的，在苏黎世的房子，人家都是准备了大量的生活供给措施。苏黎世的，还有在希腊的，在岛上的，英国那些大豪宅里面的，都准备着未来过上3、5年躲在深山老林里的生活。几大家族，像他们现在在南法那些大房子都是重修、重建，都是建立高墙壁垒，跟碉堡似的。

I get too many of these messages every day. There is a protocol in my circle that some things should never be mentioned to the public. Let me explain it like this. People of some funds that I have worked with for a long time have prepared secluded survival retreats in the mountains. They have prepared large amounts of essential provisions in their houses in Europe or Zurich. Also, some people have prepared 3 to 5 years of essential supplies that they will need to survive, on islands in Greece or in their mansions in England. Several prominent families are fortifying their homes with high walls and barriers in the south of France, like forts.

不是开玩笑的，兄弟姐妹们。这个共产党灭亡前的动静在全世界大家都闻到了。而且这个病毒一定共产党只要是不交出解药，不告诉[世界]真相，病毒一定是越来越恐怖。你可别看这几天大家觉得在美国低了，那是很可怕的。

I’m not kidding you, brothers and sisters. Everybody smells the CCP’s demise. As long as the CCP doesn’t hand over the antidote and doesn’t tell the world the truth about the coronavirus, the virus is bound to be more and more dangerous.  It doesn’t look as if the US has improved recently. The coronavirus is still lethal.
