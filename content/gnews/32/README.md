## 林肯总统关于感恩节的宣言 &#8211; 美国的信仰传统
` GM80` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/611025/)

关于感恩节：《普世佳音》介紹：“许多人都记得1620年秋天那些乘坐“五月花”号到美洲的清教徒，他们受到当地印第安人的帮助存活了下来。次年，就是1621年秋天丰收的时候，他们邀请印第安人一起庆祝，被后人称作“第一个感恩节”。到了19世纪，感恩节已经在新英格兰区成为一项重要的风俗。在1863年，正值美国内战期间（1861-1865）林肯总统宣布感恩节为全国性的节日。那时候，感恩节是在每年11月的最后一个礼拜四。直到1941年国会的法案，将它更改为11月的第4个礼拜四，感恩节不仅成为美国全国传统全家团聚的日子，更是冬季节日的序幕像征。” [1]

林肯总统于1863年7月15日签署了一份“全国祷告日宣言“ [2]，并于同年10月3日签署了众所周知的“感恩节宣言”[3]。两份宣言的翻译如下：

A Proclamation

宣言

It has pleased Almighty God to hearken to the supplications and prayers of an afflicted people and to vouchsafe to the Army and the Navy of the United States victories on land and on the sea so signal and so effective as to furnish reasonable grounds for augmented confidence that the Union of these States will be maintained, their Constitution preserved, and their peace and prosperity permanently restored. But these victories have been accorded not without sacrifices of life, limb, health, and liberty, incurred by brave, loyal, and patriotic citizens. Domestic affliction in every part of the country follows in the train of these fearful bereavements. It is meet and right to recognize and confess the presence of the Almighty Father and the power of His hand equally in these triumphs and in these sorrows:

乐于听祷告的全能的上帝听到了受苦百姓的恳求和祈祷，保证了美国陆军和海军在陆上和海上的胜利，这信号使人们因此迅速增强了信心，这使国家的联盟将得到维护，宪法将得到保护，其和平与繁荣将得到永久恢复。 但是，这些胜利无不是靠牺牲英勇、忠诚和爱国公民的生命、肢体、健康和自由为代价得来的。全国各地都有家庭承受着可怕的丧亲之痛。 向全能天父认罪和忏悔、承认祂在这些胜利与悲伤中同样掌权是非常合宜正确的事：

Now, therefore, be it known that I do set apart Thursday, the 6th day of August next, to be observed as a day for national thanksgiving, praise, and prayer, and I invite the people of the United States to assemble on that occasion in their customary places of worship and in the forms approved by their own consciences render the homage due to the Divine Majesty for the wonderful things He has done in the nation’s behalf and invoke the influence of His Holy Spirit to subdue the anger which has produced and so long sustained a needless and cruel rebellion, to change the hearts of the insurgents, to guide the counsels of the Government with wisdom adequate to so great a national emergency, and to visit with tender care and consolation throughout the length and breadth of our land all those who, through the vicissitudes of marches, voyages, battles, and sieges, have been brought to suffer in mind, body, or estate, and finally to lead the whole nation through the paths of repentance and submission to the divine will back to the perfect enjoyment of union and fraternal peace. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

因此，我决定把明年8月6日（星期四），作为一个举国感恩、赞美和祈祷的日子，我邀请美国人民聚集在他们习惯的礼拜场所，以虔诚的心敬拜天父上帝，感谢 神为这个国家所做的奇妙事情，乞求圣灵的力量来制服人心所发的愤怒，平息这漫长和不必要的残酷的叛乱，改变叛乱分子的心，加持大智慧给指导政府工作的法律顾问，以应对如此严重的国家紧急情况。并细心抚慰在我们广博土地上的那些因行军、航海、战斗和围城而改变的人们，无论是在思想上、身体上或是财产上受了苦难的，以最终能通过悔改和顺服使整个国家转向神，回归到如兄弟般团结的和平完美的日子。特此证明，我予以签名并加盖美国印章。

Done at the city of Washington, this 15th day of July, A. D. 1863, and of the Independence of the United States of America the eighty-eighth.

A Proclamation

宣言

The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and even soften the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God.

正置年尾之时，我们满享着丰收的土地与美丽晴空。对这些我们每日享受的慷慨赐予，即使我们轻易便忘记它们源自何处，却仍得到了全能上帝的保守供应。上帝恩赐的巨大力量，足以融化麻木和刚硬的心，。

In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign states to invite and provoke their aggressions, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere, except in the theater of military conflict; while that theater has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union.

虽然艰苦卓绝的内战可能会引来外国的挑衅和侵略，但在此期间，[我们看到]国家间的和平得到了维护，社会秩序得到了维持，法律得到了尊敬和遵守，除了这些军事冲突的地区外，其他地区都能和睦共处。战区也因着陆海联盟军的努力大大地缩小了。

Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle, or the ship; the ax has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege, and the battlefield, and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom.

把所需的财富和力量从和平工业区转移到国防事业上，并没有抑制农业的发展和社区的壮大开拓。铁、煤矿与贵重金属的矿物产量比以往增加更多。尽管在战区等地有人员损失，但人口仍在稳步增长。人们为国家实力和活力的提高而欢欣鼓舞，因此可以期待未来将有更大的自由和成功。

No human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.

人类的谋划和凡人之手无法产生这些伟大的成就。它们是至高造物主恩慈的礼物，主即使为我们的罪而发怒时仍显出怜悯。

It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently, and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American people. I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a Day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them that, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquility, and union.

对我而言，这些应该被全体美国人民一 心一意、庄严地、恭敬地、感激地献上感恩。我因此邀请全美各地、海内外的同胞们，将下一个11 月最后一个星期四作为感恩节，来赞美我们慈爱的天父。我也建议美国人民，在对上帝这样非凡奇妙的拯救和赐福而向天父献上感恩时，也谦卑地为我们国 家的堕落与悖逆悔过, 对所有在这场无法避免的悲惨内战中成为寡妇、孤儿、送葬者或受难者的，祈求天父温柔的看顾。强烈地恳求全能上帝的恩手尽快医治和修复这个国家，使其符合 神的旨意，得享完全的和平、融洽、安宁与团结。

In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United Stated States to be affixed.

作为证词，我谨此予以签名，并加盖美国印章。

Done at the city of Washington, this third day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.

十月三日，即主后一千八百六十三年，美国独立的第八十八年，于华盛顿市。

【编者按】圣经《诗篇》33:12： “以耶和華為神的，那國有福了！耶和華揀選為自己產業的，那民有福了！” 美国总统演讲常以：“ God bless America! ”（上帝祝福美国！）作为结束语，和林肯总统的感恩节宣言一样，都表明了美国的信仰传统。
