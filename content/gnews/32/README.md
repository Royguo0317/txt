敬爱的米奇·麦康奈尔和凯文·麦卡锡

作为宾夕法尼亚州参议员的成员，我们相信选举过程的完整性。在与我们的同事交谈之后，州参议院的大多数议员对我们联邦在2020年选举期间发生的许多怪象感到不安。

由于宾夕法尼亚州州长汤姆·沃尔夫（Tom Wolf）、州务卿凯西·布克瓦尔（Kathy Boockvar）和无赖的州最高法院多次采用非法、违法手段，州立法机构的制衡权利被剥夺，这些立法者（机构）根据美国和宾州宪法，（有权）规定举行选举的时间、地点和方式。

签署成为法律的2019年第77号法案明确了以下规定：

● 所有邮寄选票必须在选举当晚8点前收到

● 投票站的官员必须核实选民的签名

● 郡选举委员会可在选举日上午8:00后开始（统计）缺席者预投的（选票）和分检邮寄选票

● 允许由候选人和（候选人）政党选出的计票观察员监督缺席选票和邮寄选票的计票过程

● 没有对便民投票箱（drop boxes）或“改票”作出规定

在2020年大选前7周，宾州最高法院裁定：

● 邮寄选票最多可以在三天后收到并清点

● 没有邮戳的选票将被计算在内

● 邮寄选票上的签名无需核实

国务卿凯西·布克瓦尔还通过以下方式篡夺了立法权：

● 在关键的民主党地区允许大量无安全保障的便民投票箱（drop boxes）（的出现）

● 在选举前一天，鼓励一些郡（不是所有郡）通知邮寄选民的政党和候选人代表，他们的选票含有取消资格的缺陷，并允许他们“纠正”这些缺陷

除了上述异常的情况，在费城（Philadelphia）那些经认证的共和党计票观察员被禁止监督选票的计票过程。在法庭下令允许这些计票观察员观察之后，他们“被置于远离选票计票的位置，以至于无法观看计票活动”。

立法者要求进行独立调查，行政当局却不予理会。鉴于这些不正常和遭质疑的活动，我们认为宾州的选举结果不应该得到我们州务卿的认证。

**各位成员，鉴于美国最高法院将在未来几天审理川普总统诉布克瓦尔（州务卿）案，我们要求有更多的时间。我们要求你们推迟对选举团的认证，允许正当的程序以确保我们联邦的选举诚信。**

非常恭敬，

宾夕法尼亚州参议院议员

英文原文如下：

Honorable Mitch Mcconnel               Honorable Kevin Mccarthy

The Majority Leader                     Republican Leader-us House of

United States Senate                     Respresentative

As members of the Pennsylvania Senate, we believe in the integrity of the election process. After speaking with our colleagues, a majority of the State Senate is troubled by the many inconsistencies that happened in our Commonwealth during the 2020 election.

Due to numerous unlawful violations taken by Pennsylvania Governor, Tom Wolf, Secretary of State, Kathy Boockvar; and the rogue State Supreme Court, the balance of power was taken from the State Legislature, who by the U.S. and PA Constitutions, set the time, place and manner of holding elections.

Act 77 of 2019 that was signed into law, provides the following clear provisions:

● All mail-in ballots must be received by 8: 00 p.m. election night

● Officials at polling places must authenticate the signatures of voters

● County Election Boards may begin pre-canvassing of absentee and mail-in allots after 8: 00 a m. on election day

● Poll watchers selected by candidates and political parties are permitted to observe the process of canvassing absentee and mail-in ballots

● No provisions were made for drop boxes or “curing of ballots

Seven weeks before the 2020 General Election the PA Supreme Court over stepped their bounds by ruling that:

●Mail-in ballots could be received and counted up to three days later

● Ballots mailed without a postmark would be counted

● Signatures on mail-in ballots would not need to be verified.

Secretary of State, Kathy Boockvar also usurped legislative authority by:

● Allowing for a proliferation of unsecured drop boxes in key Democratic areas

● On the day before the election, encouraged some counties (not all) to notify party and candidate representatives of mail-in voters whose ballots contained disqualifying defects and allowing them to “cure” these defects

In addition to these inconsistencies, certified Republican poll watchers in Philadelphia were prohibited from overseeing the canvassing of ballots. After a court ordered these poll watchers to be allowed to observe, they were “corralled so far from the canvassing of ballots, that they could not view the activities.

Requests from legislators for independent investigations have been ignored by the administration.

Due to these inconsistent and questionable activities, we believe that PA election results should not have been certified by our Secretary of State.

**Members, we ask for more time given the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court is to hear Trump vs Boockvar in the coming days. We ask that you delay certification of the Electoral College to allow due process as we pursue election integrity in our Commonwealth.**

Very respectfully,

Members of the PA Senate
