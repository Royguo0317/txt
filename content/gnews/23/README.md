**郭先生感谢战友们的信任和分享承担责任的快乐**

**Miles Thanks for the Trust of Fellow Fighters and Shares the Happiness of Taking Responsibilities for Others**

尊敬的战友们好！2月21号，很多战友说，今天七哥再直播一小会儿，我真的直播不了了今天！我锻炼完，还要[有]很多会要开，还要出去，所以抱歉！七哥今天是直播不了啦，没时间啦，非常的抱歉！我还得锻炼！兄弟姐妹们，千万别忘了健身呐！不要给自己的懒惰任何理由。今天的放弃，就是明天的失去。今天[有]再好的理由放弃，都是你巨大的失去。千万不要[放弃]，拜托了兄弟们。

Hello, my honorable brother-in-arms (BIAs)! It’s February 21st. Many brothers-in-arms said they wanted me to broadcast for a little while, but I really can’t today! After I work out, I will have many meetings to go to, and I have to go out. So, sorry about that! Brother Seven has got no time to do live broadcast today. Deeply sorry! I still need to work out! Brothers and sisters, never forget to work out! Don’t give yourself any excuses for being lazy. Today’s giving up will result in tomorrow’s loss. Giving up for whatever good excuses you come up with today will make you lose big. Never ever give up, please, brothers.

哎呀！看七哥，又帅，又老。哎呀！这人呐，千万别说过头话。小的时候成天说，我羡慕有白头发的人，[现在]白头发越来越多啦！很多战友说，[很多战友]给我发很多信息，[表达]感动感恩。不要感恩！确实，昨天我直播完以后，很多人攻击我。咱的合作者觉得我是疯子。

Aiya! Look at your Brother Seven, handsome and old. Aiya! Never overstate anything. When I was little, I always said that I admired people with gray hair, but now I’ve got more and more of it! Many brothers-in-arms told me or sent me messages, expressing how they have been moved and showing their gratitude. Save your gratitude! Indeed, after my live broadcast yesterday, many people have attacked me. My partners thought I was a lunatic.

七哥从小到大都是被怀疑。郭骗子、郭疯子、郭三秒，还有啥呀？郭没钱，伴随着我的一生。我特别感谢郭骗子这个词儿，因为它始终告诉我，那个方向我不要去。它永远纠正[着]我，特别特别的好。但是兄弟姐妹们，这个世界上能跨过那个线的人，太少了，太少了。

I have been doubted since I was young. “Fraudster Guo”, “lunatic Guo”, “three-second Guo”, what else, “penniless Guo”, – these names have accompanied me throughout my life. I specifically want to thank for the name, “Fraudster Guo”, because it always reminds me not to go that direction. It has always been correcting me, which is so fantastic, but brothers and sisters, very few people in this world can reach that state.

文贵不值得任何战友们说感恩和感谢，我们是平等的。凭什么[由于]你们相信七哥，就应该享受苦难呢？凭什么你们因为相信，就失去那么多呢？特别是[有的]战友有老人有孩子，哪有那么多时间[去]对付这个九指妖去。这种魔鬼，它利用了我们的信任和善良。它应该受到更猛烈的，最严厉的美国法律的惩罚。不是每个战友，都有这个能力，有这个时间。所以说[这是]七哥应该做的。在法律上，在现实当中，七哥没这个责任。从感情上，七哥必须这么做。所以说兄弟姐妹们，你们不要说感激感恩。这么多信息，我看不完啦！

I, Miles, don’t deserver gratitude from any BIA. We are equal. Why do you have to suffer because you have trusted Brother Seven, and why do you have to lose so much because you have believed in me? Especially those BIAs who have kids and elderlies, how can they find enough time to deal with this nine-finger demoness? Demons of this kind have used our trust and kindness, so they should bear harsher, perhaps the strictest punishments according to US law. Not every BIA has the ability and the time for this. This is what Brother Seven should do. Brother Seven has no liability by law or in reality, but from the heart, Brother Seven must do this. So brothers and sisters, you don’t need to express your gratitude. So many messages, I can’t read them all!

这就是我们中国人所必须拥有的。不能像共产党一样。需要别人的时候，就让别人信任你；不需要的时候，或者需要别人承担责任的时候，你就把信任一脚给踢开，[把信任]当成利用的工具。你不能说，你需要别人的时候，你让别人100%信任你，当需要你来给个公平和帮助的时候，让你讲信任的时候，你就完全忘掉了你过去的承诺。这不但不公平，[也]是不道德的。共产党的欺弱怕强，在中国几十年了。我们不能说，Sara九指妖这种坏人、龟头洋陈其生这帮孙子，还有魏修竹，这种坏人，我们怕他？让战友们去受虐，不可以的！坏人交给七哥，这是必然的。

This [the courage of taking responsibility] is what we Chinese must have. We can’t be like the CCP, who asks for people’s trust when it needs others, and when it doesn’t need others or it needs others to be the scapegoat, it will kick away trust in no time, treating trust only as a tool. What you shouldn’t do is when you need others, you let them trust you 100%, and when they need you for your fairness and help or need you to prove your trustworthiness, you totally forget your past promises. Not only is it unfair, it’s also immoral. The CCP has been bullying the weak but being afraid of the strong in China for decades. Bad guys like Sara, the “nine-finger demoness”, and the SOBs such as Chen Qisheng, the “penis-head Yang”, and also Wei Xiuzhu, are we afraid of them? No! It’s not okay to let BIAs suffer. Let me handle these bad guys. I have to.

我特别享受，虽然受到很多挑战，但是七哥很享受。律师这就又发信息来，让我跟他今天开会。我就是不跟他开，咋的？他能咋的你七哥啊？是不是？七哥做完了[这个]决定，醒来，天不[还]是天，地[不还]是地吗？谁能咋地呀？是不是？干了坏事，你今天不一定[能]那么舒服；干了好事，我老舒服了。多少战友啊！这个九指妖骗了8000个人，那就是，甚至是几万个家庭睡不着觉！七哥一人承担，多少人睡着觉，多少人踏实，而且你们就尽管去憧憬着美好的未来。不会超过两个月，你们会有更加切实的利益和感受。否则的话，[他们]伴随着痛苦[得]多长时间啊？七哥一人承担了，这么多人幸福，值不值？值得呢。我就在想，我这一辈子能有这样的承担，能让那么多人幸福，这是多美好的事？很多人不珍惜，不懂得，我特别珍惜。

I enjoy this so much. Although I’m facing many challenges, I enjoy it. My lawyer has just sent messages, asking me to meet with him. I just won’t meet him, so what? What can he do about your Brother Seven? Right? After I made the decision and woke up, the sky was still that sky and the earth was still that earth, right? Who can change that? Right? If you do a bad thing today, you won’t feel this good, but I’ve done something good, so I feel really great. So many BIAs have been cheated by this nine-finger demoness! Eight thousand people, which means tens of thousands of families can’t sleep well! I, Brother Seven, taking the responsibilities can make so many people sleep well and rest assured that they can have the wildest dreams about their wonderful future. In no more than two months, you will see real benefits. If [I didn’t do it], for how long will they be accompanied by agony? Brother Seven, just me, one person shouldering the burden will make so many people happy. Is it worthwhile? Yes, it is. I am thinking how beautiful it is if I take this responsibility so as to make so many people happy. What a wonderful thing! Many people don’t cherish this opportunity or understand it, but I really do.

我感谢战友们曾经给我的信任，再一次考验了七哥，到底应该是信奉什么，也让我更坚定正道主义。还有里面很多战略战术的事，七哥还没说呐，等哪天我直播说了，吓你们一大跳！这里面是有战略战术的，兄弟姐妹们。为啥是昨天说呀？为什么第一天不说？第一天我就想要这么做。这一点，我听了律师意见。七哥要有这个智慧，不能那么做。第二，七哥也钓鱼啊，是吧？咱得多钓钓鱼啊，钓钓鱼，同时也跟战友们健健身嘛，也健健心，是吧？战友咱们之间也互相考验考验。

I want to thank the BIAs who have given me trust, which has tested me for what my belief is, and also held me steadfast to the rule of righteousness. I, Brother Seven haven’t really talked about the strategies and tactics involved, which I will tell you someday through my live broadcast as a big surprise! There are strategies and tactics involved, brothers and sisters. Why did I make the announcement yesterday? Why didn’t I say it on the first day? I wanted to do that the very first day, while I listened to the lawyer’s advice. I had to have the wisdom of not doing it that way. Secondly, I needed to do some “fishing”, right? I needed to “fish” a little longer, and in the meantime, I could exercise my body and mind with the BIAs, to allow our BIAs to test each other out, right?

你们无法想象啊，没有一个战友责备我。没有一个人这样说，七哥，因为你，我被骗了。一个都没有！这 8000 个人也好，几万个人也好，七哥得到了多高的信任，多高的尊重？七哥要不做这个事情，我这良心就大大的坏了。人生啊，谁要懂得做好事的快乐的时候，你就真的是修成正果了！就得到了清凉的法喜，破掉了你的缺漏，征服了贪嗔痴慢疑。那这个愉悦和清凉是真的不能言语，妙不可言！我们一起奋斗吧，兄弟姐妹们。人生无限的美好，但是都是建立在善良之上。没有一个美好，是建立在欺骗、作恶、伤害他人［之上］。永远的，在任何地方，任何国家，任何时间。

You can’t imagine that not even a single BIA has blamed me. No one has told me anything like this, “Brother Seven, I’ve been scammed because of you.” Not even one! Whether it’s 8,000 people or tens of thousands of people, I have gained so much trust and so much respect! If I don’t do this, I will be the worst guy with no conscience. If one knows the joy of doing good in his life, he has truly “come to fruition”, obtained cool and clear pritijanana, remedied his omissions, and conquered his ignorance, egoism, attachments, aversions and anxiety. So, this clear and cool joy is so magical, beyond any words can describe. Let’s strive together, brothers and sisters. The happiness in one’s life has no limit, but it’s all built on conscience. No good things are built on decisiveness, evilness or hurting others. This is forever true, in any place, any country, at any time.

九指妖等人，他们将面临着绝对的监狱［刑罚］，甚至［他们］是一生都坐不完。那条路是多么的危险！永远记住，法律的红线，道德红线，永远不要碰。不说了，俺得继续锻炼，中不中，兄弟姐妹们？Okay？

Nine-finger demoness and others will face imprisonment for longer than their lifetime. That path is too dangerous! Always remember, never cross the red line of law and morality. Will say no more. I have to keep working out. Are you okay with that, brothers and sisters? Okay?
