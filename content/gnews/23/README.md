**Steve Bannon: **Want to go to Dr. Richard Fleming. Dr Fleming, real quick can you give, just a quick your expertise in this area before we start going down a line of question?

**史蒂夫·班农**：我要连线理查德**·**费莱明博士. 费莱明博士您能在我们开始提问前快速地谈谈您在这一领域的专业技能吗？

**Dr. Richard Fleming:** Well the actual theory that explains why people with Sars-Cov2 who develop a disease that’s an inflammo-thrombotic disease, called Covid-19 was first presented by myself in 1994 at the American Heart Association meetings. That theory on inflammation, heart disease which account for these blood clots and inflammation is now accepted by most people as the cause for these chronic inflammatory disease. And that’s why the people with comorbidities were dying with Covid-19 because they weren’t being treated for that. I’m also the man who developed the imaging method for actually measuring changes in the tissue to monitor Sars-Cov2 and Covid-19 treatment responses. I have conducted a national clinical trial in seven countries at 23 sites showing what treatments work and don’t. And I may be the only one who’s actually gone through the review documents of the EUA to look at what these vaccines really can and can’t claim that they do. And we’ve done a tremendous amount of work to define the gain-of-function work: where that money came from? Who was involved with it?  And that’s important because the spike protein that’s coded for in these vaccines represents this genetic sequence that is man-made, so that the virus, the vaccines which are drugs that are being used actually contain sequences that are human-inserted into viruses so that what we’re dealing with is not a naturally occurring virus and it’s doing exactly what was designed to do, which is to increase infection and produce inflammation and blood clots. And so, vaccines like Johnson & Johnson’s or Pfizer, Moderna’s or Astraxeneca which actually has a component in it, trying to dissolve blood clots, are actually doing what one would expect: they are producing inflammation and blood clotting. When the virus is initially passed from person to person, it was only the people with these increased tendencies to form these blood clots and inflammation, and the people with the comorbidities, the older people with the heart disease, the diabetics who were showing the sings and were dying again because they weren’t being treated. Now, with the vaccines we’re dumping a larger load of material to make this non-naturally occurring spike protein producing this inflammon-thrombotic response in people that normally would not have a problem. But because there’s either 13 billion or 50 billion depending upon whether you’re talking about, the mRNA or DNA vaccines, even people that are healthy are now producing this increased inflammo-thrombotic response. That’s why you are seeing the blood clots in the deaths.

**理查德****·费****莱明博士**：好的，我的理念解释了为什么感染了Sars-Cov2病毒的人群会得炎性血栓病症，即Covid-19。这是我于1994年在美国心脏协会会议上首次提出的一个理论。这个关于炎症、心脏病会导致血栓和炎症的理论现在已被大多数人认定是这些慢性炎症性疾病的病因。这就是为什么患有并发症的患者会死于Covid-19，因为他们并没有得到相应的治疗。我还开发了一种成像技术用于实际评估细胞组织的变化以监测Sars-Cov2和身体对Covid-19治疗手段的反应。我已在七个国家的23个地点开展了一项国家级临床试验，以展示哪些疗法有效，哪些无效。 而且，我可能是唯一真正通读过EUA审阅性文件的人。进而，我得以审视这些疫苗真正能做什么，不能做什么。此外，我们做了大量的工作以定义“功能增强性实验”。（支持这种研究的）经费来自哪里? 有谁参与其中？这很重要，因为编码在这些疫苗中的刺突蛋白展示了其基因序列是人为改造的，因此，病毒以及正在使用的疫苗，即药物实际上包含人工插入的（基因）序列， 因此我们要对付的不是自然来源的病毒，而且，这个病毒正按照它被设计的功能在发挥作用，即增强传染性，并产生炎症和血栓。因此，强生、辉瑞、莫德纳或者阿斯利康疫苗，它们实际上都含有某种成分，这种成分试图溶解血栓，（但）实际上这些（成分）正发生一些大家可以料想到的作用：它们正引发炎症以及血栓。当病毒最初在人与人之间传播时，只有那些易生病的人才容易形成这些血栓和炎症，并且患有并发症的患者, 患有心脏病的老年人以及糖尿病患者有这种症状（炎症或血栓）时，因为他们没有得到治疗而同样面临死亡。现在，随着疫苗的使用，我们正向人们大量地注射这种“物质”，从而使这种非天然存在的刺突蛋白在通常没有问题的人身上产生这种炎性血栓反应。但是因为有130亿或500亿支所谓的mRNA疫苗或DNA疫苗，即使健康的人现在也在不断地产生炎性血栓反映。这就是为什么你们在死亡的病例中看到血栓的原因。

**Steve Bannon: **Why in the mainstream media, on CNN and MSNBC, Why would you be considered as apostate in the mainstream media? You hear Dr. (Sanjay) Gupta here, these people on CNN, the same guys, by the way, that told us it came out of a bat cave on the China-Laos border and it came up 1000 miles to the back country and got to a wet (market), but had nothing to do with the P-4 lab down the street.  Why would they say, “Fleming’s another crack; Fleming is a nutcase; Fleming is one of these anti-vax guys” Why is it? It seems like the mainstream thought of the scientific community. It would be opposed to your analysis right there.

**史蒂夫·班农：**为什么在CNN和MSNBC等主流媒体的眼中，您被他们视为异端，离经叛道之人？ 您也听到（桑杰）古普塔博士(的话)，顺便说一下，同样是CNN的这波人他们告诉我们这病毒是从中国-老挝边境上的一个蝙蝠洞传出来的，它“跑”了1000英里到过内陆的一个海鲜市场，但与同在一条街上的P4实验室毫无关系。他们为什么会说：“弗莱明是另一个古怪的人？弗莱明是个疯子，弗莱明就是反疫苗这帮人中的一员。”为什么会是这样呢？看起来这些主流媒体也有考虑科学界的知识。这都在反对您所作的分析。

**Dr. Richard Fleming: **Well, I think there’s a lot of eggs on the face, if you will- -from people that are now following kind of the party line, you know. If you ask, I’m an allopathic doctor; I am a MD; I am not anti-vax; I’m just anti bad medicine. I’m anti using something that hasn’t been proven to be effective or safe. And most people use the term safety and efficacy and that is, that’s flipped around. It’s efficacy and safety. And one of the things that nobody has apparently done because of her, nobody talked about it. If you go to the emergency use authorization documents for Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and you take out of those very documents that the FDA saw. And you look at the numbers which is the slide that I provided. I don’t know if you have that in front of you and you actually ask the legitimate first question. Do these vaccines statistically reduce the number of people who come down with Covid-19? If you look at that data, not my data, their date, the data they submitted to the FDA. If you look at that data, you’ll see that seven days after the second injection with Pfizer. There is no statistical difference in the number of people who come with Covid whether they get vaccinated or not. If you use the Moderna data, and they want you to look at two weeks after the second shot. There is no difference in the number of cases of Covid whether they get vaccinated or not. If you look at the Johnson & Johnson material, at 14 days, there is statistically significant difference. But two weeks later, at 28 days using the EUA documents that these companies provided themselves, there is no difference between the people who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and those who didn’t, as far as developing Covid-19. So, the first question is, are these vaccines beneficial? And the answer to that question based upon their documents, not Dr. Richard Fleming’s, is no, there is no statistical difference. Then you can start asking that other question…

**理查德****·费****莱明博士**： 好吧， 我认为他们丑态百出，要知道，你们是些囿于成见的人。如果你非要问的话，我是一名对抗疗法的医生， 我是医学博士，我并不反对疫苗，我只是反对那些差劲的药物。我反对使用尚未被证明有效或安全的东西。大多数人都在谈论“安全性”和“功效”这两个术语，实际上顺序说反了：应该是“功效”和“安全性”。显然，还有一件事没有人做过，因为她，没有人谈论此事。如果您查阅了辉瑞、莫德纳和强生等疫苗的紧急使用授权文件，然后,您拿出了FDA所批阅的那些文件，并看看那些数字，在我所提供的幻灯片上有显示。我不知道你面前有没有这些数字。然后你会提出第一个合同的疑问。从数据上看，这些疫苗是否减少了Covid-19患者的数量？如果您关注这些数据，不是我的数据，是他们的数据，他们（以上这些药企）提供给FDA的数据。如果您详查这些数据，您会看到在辉瑞疫苗第二次接种的7天后，感染Covid的人数没有变化，无论他们是否接种疫苗。如果您使用莫德纳的数据，你们希望您看接种第二剂疫苗两周后的数据，感染Covid的人数没有变化，无论他们是否接种了疫苗。如果您看强生的资料，在第14天时感染人数有很大的变化，然而两周后，在第28天分析这些公司自己提供的紧急使用授权文件，接种强生疫苗与未接种强生疫苗感染Covid-19的人数没有变化。 因此，第一个问题是：这些疫苗有效吗？基于他们（药企）的文件，而不是基于我理查德.费莱明博的文件，这个问题的答案是：没有作用，在统计数据上不会有差异。然后，您会开始问另一个问题……

**Steve Bannon: **But, hang on a second. But, hang on a second. They say you’ve seen on mainstream media, New York Times. It’s 96%. What effective, 96% efficacy, 98%. Today, today, hang on, today I think Willie Geist at MSNBC, we started the show with, they have breaking news and he comes in and I think he’s reading something that says, “You know, the six clots per 7 million still means it’s 99.99% effective.” So, what say you to that?

**史蒂夫·班农：**但是,等一下,等一下,(主流媒体)他们说,(相信)您在主流媒体如&lt;&lt;纽约时报&gt;&gt;上看到了 (疫苗有效率)是96%。什么有效率是96%、98%之类（的论述）。今天，今天，等我说完，我记得是MSNBC的威利l盖斯特,我们援引了他的节目作为开场,他们得到了突发新闻,他开始播报，而且，我觉得他在读着某些内容，说道：“要知道每700万人仅有6个出现血栓，这仍然说明了疫苗99.99%的有效率”。那么，您对此有何见解？

**Dr. Richard Fleming: **Right. So, as vaccine efficacy is determined, exactly opposite of what you think it is. It is how many people came down with Covid in the vaccine group over how many people came with with Covid in the non-vaccine group. And that’s called the risk ratio. And you take one minus the risk ratio and that gives you vaccine efficacy. And that would be like me coming and telling you, “Steve, I want you to take this drug because it’s going to fail only this amount of time.”** **But if you ask the question, which is “does this vaccine prevent people from coming down with Covid-19?” And you take their data and you run their numbers which is in that slide that I sent over. It shows that even though you think there is a difference, that’s why we do statistical analysis. It shows that there isn’t a difference, it’s just a random chance.** There is no scientific evidence in the EUA documents.** **Unless, remember, there are still experimental vaccines, they have not been FDA approved. And people are not signing informed consent on these experimental drugs.** And, both Pfizer and Moderna quit recruiting for their experimental protocols on around the 20th of January. And, at that point in time, they didn’t need to because these were being rolled out. And they didn’t need to recruit anybody because everybody listening to your program and everybody not listening to your program is either in the experimental or the control group of this study. So, they don’t need to keep recruiting people. The numbers themselves show that the vaccines don not make no difference in the number of people that will come down with Covid-19. What we now know is that we’re seeking risk popping up across the board. And they’re all inflammatory and blood clotting. And it’s affecting not just the people with the comorbidities; it’s affecting the people that normally now we’re healthy and they’re being overwhelmed because their immune systems work. They are making antibodies to these vaccines. **And let’s remember two things. First of all, the spike protein is not naturally occurring; it is gain-of-function. It is crossing the blood brain barrier. And we know in the animal models of these spike proteins. We knows that in humanized mice they develop spongiform encephalopathy, which is, for the general public, mad cow disease. We also know that in the rhesus macaque models that about two weeks afterwards they develop Lewy bodies in the brain and inflammation. Lewy bodies are what caused Alzheimer’s and a number of neurologic disorders. And those numbers translate into about a year and a half for human beings to see the same consequences.** So, no statistically significant benefit from the very EUA documents that are posted, not mine, the company’s. Inflammation and blood clotting occurring with it. Lewy bodies, mad cow disease and nothing that suggests a benefit. It’s an experimental drug that people aren’t finding informed consent for and you are part of the control or experimental group.

**理查德****·费****莱明博士**：好的，疫苗有效率的确定与您所想的完全相反。（疫苗有效率的确定）是用疫苗接种组中感染的Covid的患者数除以非疫苗接种组中感染Covid的患者数，得到的数即是风险比率。然后你用1减去风险比率则等于疫苗有效率。这就好比，我来告诉你：“史蒂夫，我要你服用这种药物，因为它只有很小的几率会失效。” 但是，如果您问这样一个问题：“这种疫苗是否可以防止人们感染Covid-19？” 然后您追踪他们的数据，根据他们的数据进行计算，结果就在我发送的幻灯片中。它表明，即便您认为有区别，这就是我们进行统计分析的原因，结果表明没有区别，那只是一个随机的结果。**紧急****授权****文件中没有科学证据（****支持****）****。请记住****，这些仍是实验性疫苗****，****他们尚未获得****FDA批准。****人****们****并****未****在****这****些实验性药物上****签署****知情同意****书****。**而且，辉瑞和莫德纳都于1月20日左右放弃了他们的试验招募计划。而且，在那个时候，他们已不需要（志愿者）了， 因为这些（疫苗）早已正式推出。而且，他们不需要招募任何人，因为所有那些听了您的节目以及不听您节目的人，要么属于本研究的实验组，要么属于对照组， 因此他们不需要继续招募人员。数字本身表明接种疫苗对感染Covid-19的人数没有产生任何影响。现在我们所知道的是我们看到了全方面的风险：几乎都是炎症和血栓。它不仅影响患有并发症的人群，它还影响着通常身体健康的人们，他们的身体正遭受打击，因为他们的免疫系统正常运转，（免疫系统）正在制造针对这些疫苗的抗体。让我们记住两件事。**首先，刺****突蛋白不****是天然存在的****；****它****具****有人工增强的功能。它****能够****穿越血脑****屏障，****而且我们****在****动物****模型****中了****解****这些刺****突蛋白，我****们知道，在人源化的老鼠****中****，****它****们（刺****突蛋白****）****会引****发****海绵状脑病，****对于普通大众来说，就是“****疯牛****病”****。我****们****还****知道在****恒河猴模型****中，大约（****感染****）****两周****后，会在大脑中形成路易氏体并****引****发炎症****。路****易氏体是引起****老年****痴呆症和许多神经系统疾病的原因。****这****些****数学****意****味****着大约一年半的****时间****，****人****类就可以****看相****同的结果****会****发生在人类自己身上。**因此，（FDA）所发布的紧急授权文件来看，统计上没有显示（疫苗）有显著的成效。这些文件并非来自我这里，而是来自药企，随之而来的还有炎症和血栓。路易氏体、疯牛病，还有疫苗没有显示出任何益处。这是一种实验性药物，人们没有获得知情同意，并且，每个人都是对照组或实验组成员之一。

**Steve Bannon: **And the companies are open and that’s why you have the emergency use authorization. There’s so this is going to be quite complicated. We’re gona have you back on. But last thing, today when they take the podium up at the White House, Dr. Fauci and the team, what would you recommend to them? Clearly, this hit like a bombshell and they know they have a problem here now. What would you recommend Dr. Fauci and the other doctors? What should they say about the Johnson & Johnson situation right now?  And what course of action would you recommend to Joe Bidden?

**史蒂夫·班农：**这些制药公司仍在正常经常,这就是为什么他们用紧急使用授权的原因。这事情变得非常复杂，我们还会邀请您再上我们的节目。最后，今天当福奇博士及其团队出现在白宫发言台时，您会对他们提出什么建议呢？显然，这种打击（疫苗的无效以及严重不良反应）就像重磅炸弹爆炸一样。他们知道他们现在出现了问题，您对福奇博士及其团队有何建议呢？他们对目前强生的状况应该说些什么呢？您会建议乔**.**拜登采取什么措施呢？

**Dr. Richard Fleming: **At this point of time, based upon the evidence that we just went to, President Biden should call for the immediate cessation of the vaccination of American individuals with these vaccines and should call for an immediate reevaluation of. First, whether there’s any demonstrated efficacy? Because there is not. And secondly, what are the potential consequences of having already vaccinated a substantial number of individuals in this country? And third, a full review not only of this data, but of the people that were involved in the gain of function research and the promulgation of these vaccines.

**理查德****·费****莱明博士**：在这个时间点上，根据我们刚刚回顾的证据, 拜登总统应呼吁立即停止让美国人接种这些疫苗，并应呼吁立即重新评估如下内容：首先，是否有任何被认证的有效疫苗，因为（当下我们分析过）没有。其次，本国大量已经接种了疫苗的人群，他们有何潜在后果？第三，不仅要对这些数据进行全面审查，还要对参与功能增强性研究的人员和发布疫苗的人员进行全面审查。

**Steve Bannon: **Dr. Fleming, we got a bounce out. How do people get more access to you? Social media, website, all of that.

**史蒂夫·班农：**弗莱明博士，我们要结束访谈了，人们通过怎样的渠道才能更好地了解您呢？社交媒体，网站之类的渠道。

**Dr. Richard Fleming: **There is a website called flemingmethod.com, where we have a number of papers. We published the actual research and results of Sars-Cov2 of these vaccines of everything that is out there and provide an opportunity for people to learn and obtain the knowledge and information that they need to. I would also encourage the people to get involved in their individual states. Here in the state of Texas, there is a number of bills before the House and Congress where they’re looking at the vaccines, the masking families, what they’re doing with children.  I would also call for the immediate cessation of any vaccination programs, not just to find the American citizens, but particularly emphasizing the fact that the universities that are receiving funding from the US government which is our tax dollars to government’s, not the government’s tax dollars. They’re our tax dollars. To immediately stop the mandates that are going out to places like Notre Dame and other universities where they’re trying to force their students into becoming vaccinated.

**理查德****·费****莱明博士**：我有一个名为flemingmethod.com的网站，在那我上传了很多论文，我们发表了Sars-Cov2的实际研究成果，以及所有这些疫苗的研究结果，并为人们提供了学习并获得知识的机会。我还鼓励人们参与其所在州的活动。比如，在得克萨斯州，州议会的参众两院会提出许多法案，来审查疫苗，审核家庭口罩使用以及审核（医药公司）对儿童的行为。我还呼吁立即停止任何疫苗接种计划，不仅要停止（医药公司）招募美国公民（进行试验），还要特别强调一个事实，那些接受美国政府资助的大学，那些资金是我们的纳税收入，而不是所谓的“政府的税收”，那是我们的税金，应立即废除圣母大学和其它大学所发出的强制性疫苗接种政策，他们正试图迫使学生接种疫苗。

**Steve Bannon: **Dr. Fleming, thank you very much for taking the time. Look forward to having you back on either tonight or tomorrow. Really appreciate that you changed your schedule to join us today.

**史蒂夫·班农：**弗莱明博士，非常感谢您抽出宝贵的时间，期待您今晚或明天再度参与我们的节目。非常感谢您今天更改日程，参与我们的节目。

**Dr. Richard Fleming: **Thank you. My pleasure. Thank you.

**理查德·费莱明博士**：谢谢，这是我的荣幸。
