**整个华尔街正在玩一场极为危险的游戏**

**Wall Street Is Playing an Extremely Dangerous Game Now**

另外，美国现在整个华尔街正在玩一场极为危险的游戏。这次华尔街，大家都很清楚华尔街这次股票的崩溃只是时间长短，一模一样，不会有什么意外。说不会崩盘绝不可能，只是炒多高下来，还有多少人可能倾家荡产（的问题）。但这一次华尔街玩的游戏，（他们）准备好了两样东西：第一个，把（股市）炒涨起来，涨到今年年底甚至到明年5月份前，炒最高的时候绝大多数的钱全部要出去钱。钱出去上哪去，兄弟姐妹们？放哪儿去啊？他们得找地方放，虚拟加密货币（和）黄金，就这两样东西，没有任何第三个地方能放。

Besides, the United States is now playing an extremely dangerous game in Wall Street. This time, everyone in Wall Street is well aware that the collapse of Wall Street’s stocks is just a matter of time, and there won’t be any surprises about this. It is absolutely impossible for anyone to say that the market will not collapse. It is just a matter of how high the stock price will be speculated to before it collapses and how many people will go bankrupt. For the game played by the Wall Street this time, they’ve prepared two things: the first one is to lift the stock market up until the end of this year or even before May next year. When it gets to the peak time, most of the money will flow out. To where, brothers and sisters? Where will the money go? They will have to find a place to put it – Virtual cryptocurrency and gold. There is no third place to put it.

大家看到昨天咱们一个金融界的非常棒的战友发的信息：Coinbase从0.2，2毛钱到340块钱是多少倍？这叫初创投资和上市投资。（咱们）想上市是很容易的，非常容易就可以直接上。但是这就是为什么今天的SEC主席瓦格就是来自于支持虚拟货币的（阵营）。而且现在华尔街神秘的手都在玩虚拟货币。

You guys saw the message sent by one of our great fellow fighters in the financial sector yesterday: How many times has the price of Coinbase multiplied by going from 20 cents to 340 dollars? This is called initial investment and public investment. It’s easy to go public, very easy to go public directly. But this is why today’s SEC Chairman Gensler (?) is from the group who is in support of virtual currencies. And now those mysterious hands of Wall Street are all playing with virtual currencies.

比特币就两个“人”的：共产党和华尔街。其它几个虚拟货币涨起来所有背后几乎都是共产党和华尔街，这两个洗钱集团正在往市场上猛推高，然后（会）摔下来把大家都摔死，（那时候）他（自己）就能活吗？所以现在大家都在等着这帮傻货往里冲，现在给描绘了一个金山银山的前景，冲啊！然后“啪”下来，全都完球蛋了。战友们，越是这个时候千万记住：投机还有赌博式心理一定会让你倾家荡产，身败名裂。（因此）永远不要掺和，国内的战友永远不要掺和！

Bitcoin has only two owners: the CCP and Wall Street. Several other rising virtual currencies also have the CCP and Wall Street behind their back. These two money laundering groups (the CCP and Wall Street) are pushing up the market, and then will throw it down to the ground to kill everyone so that they can survive. So now everyone is waiting for idiots to rush in the market by portraying a prospect of gold and silver mountains. “Let’s rush in!” And then “pop”, and everyone will be over. My fellow fighters, please remember this, a gambler’s mentality will surely ruin you and make you loose both your money and your reputation. Therefore, please never get involved (in the virtual currency market). My fellow fighters in mainland China, don’t get involved!

这是为什么G-TV，G-Coin，G- Dollar大家有一点脑子人都知道它意味着什么？这是为什么咱们能搭建一个全世界没有任何一个G-TV，G-News，G-Coin，G- Dollar，G- Fashion，G-Clubs同时搭建的平台，同时都踩着世界舞点上，而且都这么干干净净的一步一步稳稳的往前走，谁能挡得住啊？加密货币，虚拟经济和实体经济的结合：G-Coin，G-Dollar，G- Fashion。

This is why anyone who has a brain would know what G-TV, G-Coin, and G-Dollar actually mean. This is why we can build a platform with G-TV, G-News, G-Coin, G-Dollar, G-Fashion, and G-Clubs but nobody else in this world can and why we can dance to the rhythm and beat of the world and move forward steadily step by step so cleanly. Who can stop our steps? G-Coin, G-Dollar, and G-Fashion are a combination of cryptocurrency, virtual economy and real economy.

G-Clubs 接下来是唯一一个在最关键时期百分之百每年巨额盈利的企业。去想想，去想想去吧，我就不说了。G-TV百分之百唯一性稀缺资源，G-News稀缺资源，唯一在关键人类的时候讲病毒、讲真相拯救人类的现代化社交媒体和门户网站相结合的社交平台。你说这几个加在一起是什么感觉？

Next, G-Clubs will be the only company that is 100% profitable every year during the most critical period. Think about it, just think about it, I won’t talk about it. G-TV is a 100% unique, scarce resource. So is G-News – the only social platform that combines modern social media and portals to talk about [the truth about] the virus and tell the truth to save mankind at such a critical time for mankind. What do you think when you take into account all these factors together?

大家想想，兄弟姐妹们。要不然你看到人家虚拟货币人家赚钱你只能看，你连闻都不能闻。你看了人家加密货币人家赚钱你连摸的机会（都没有），闻都闻不着。否则你看着世界上唯一的共产党倒下后你连个灰儿都捡不着，因为你没有参与，你没有金融。你看到全世界虚拟经济和加密货币、加密金融和实体经济结合的时候你连灰儿都摸不着，那不就完了吗？

Brothers and sisters, think about it. Otherwise, you can only watch other people making money from virtual currencies, but you won’t even have the chance to smell it or touch it.
And when you watch the world’s only Communist Party falling down, you won’t be able to take any advantage from it, because you are not involved and you aren’t involved financially. So you will be screwed if you only watch the virtual economy, cryptocurrency, crypto finance and real economy get united in the world, and you don’t have the chance to get involved, right?

而这次爆料革命、新中国联邦让所有的战友们参与这个伟大的时刻，咱必须体面、富有的、安全的生活才能灭共！

And our Whistleblower Movement and NFSC are getting all our fellow fighters involved in this great moment because we must have a decent and wealthy life so that we have the ability to take down the CCP.
