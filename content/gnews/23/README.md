**过去的两个月中共国****“****报复社会****”****事件暴增！****80****万私营企业倒闭！**

**The Surge of Violent Crimes and Bankruptcies of Private Companies in China**

同时现在，中共国的现在经济到什么程度大家都知道啊。

Do you know how seriously Communist China’s economy has deteriorated?

仅仅，仅仅过去2个月，在全国各地所谓的他们定义的恶性的所谓报复社会[事件]。事实上是逼得人[已经是]不是“上梁山”了，梁山都没了，是逼得人不能当人了，不能干人事了。

In the past two months, 70,000 cases of what the CCP defines as “vicious retaliation against society” have taken place across the country. Actually, these cases are occurring because these people have been driven beyond the point of survival. (The Chinese ancient novel “Outlaws of the Marsh” told the story of what occurred on “Mount Liang”.) Now that “Mount Liang” is gone, people who cannot survive are forced to commit violence.

我们反对暴力。但人但凡有点儿选择也不会走上它们说的报复社会的路。是那些共产党的走狗们欺压百姓没有活路了，只有一个选择了。达多少起呢？7万起！7万起血腥暴力社会事件。

We are against violence, but we must understand that nobody would do such a thing if they had a choice. They do not want to take revenge on society. CCP, the organized crime organization, and its gangsters oppress people and make more and more Lao Bai Xing (ordinary people) unable to survive. These people have no other choice, and 70,000 bloody and violent incidents occurred as a result.

说这是1982年到83年期间，整个当时所谓的“严打”，邓小平以“严打”为名，所谓蒙古有强奸女学生的案子[为由展开]严打，杀了几万人。连弄颗白菜都要给弄死，那我是很清楚的。现在说加在一起，把当年1982～1983年所有案件累积在一起还不只2个月的[总]和呢。

Between 1982 and 1983, Deng Xiaoping gave orders to implement a severe crackdown on criminal activities, citing the rape of young girls in Mongolia. And it led to the executions of tens of thousands of people. Some even got executed for minor misdemeanors such as stealing a cabbage. I know very well what happened then. The total number of cases between 1982 and 1983 is not as many as that in the last two months.

共产党很恐惧，如果7万变成70万的时候，这个社会就就不是什么报复社会了，就是社会受到了极权压迫[的表现]，到700万的时候共产党完蛋了。就这么简单。

The CCP must be scared. If 70,000 cases grow to 700,000, it will not be an act of revenge against society. It will be a reaction to totalitarian oppression. If it expands to 7 million cases, the CCP will be finished. It is that simple.

然后银行、金融，就国内各方面咱们战友报信息，国内的银行过去是「玩」“还旧贷新”这个骗局，共产党自己的庞氏骗局，银行实际上45%到50%都成烂账了。这个“还旧贷新”的周转在过去的2到3个月里边，将近50%左右基本上都延续不下去了。就这么可怕！国内大概80万的私人企业全部倒闭，倒闭80万，80万！

Our fellow fighters also told me about banks, finance, and various aspects of mainland China. The banks in mainland China get used to playing tricks, and cover defaulted loans with new loans. This is the CCP’s own Ponzi game. In fact, 45% to 50% of the bank loans are already in default and cannot be repaid. The banks cannot continue playing the loan-pyramid scheme in almost 50% of the loan cases in the last 2 to 3 months. How bad it is. Around 800,000 private companies claimed bankruptcy in mainland China. It was 800,000 private companies!
