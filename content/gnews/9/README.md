1205早间要闻-NewYork Time

**国家情报总监：中共正在研发制造超级士兵**

**Director of National Intelligence: the CCP is developing and manufacturing super soldiers**

中共招募神经科学最顶尖的德国科学家进行猴子换头实验，以获得“将芯片植入大脑控制士兵思想的神经科学技术”；利用基因编辑技术，克隆出特定功能的人体器官；

In order to achieve the neuroscientific technology that implants chips into the brain to control soldiers’ minds. The CCP recruited top German neuroscientists to conduct experiments of switching heads by monkeys. They also clone human organs with specific functions by using gene editing technology.

**参议院情报委员会两党领袖发布联合声明**

**The bipartisan leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a joint statement**

两党领袖呼应前日国家情报总监“中国是自二战以来对美国和世界民主自由的最大威胁”的论点，发表联合声明称，中共不会放弃主导世界的野心，中共对美国构成了最大威胁。继续为美国即将发出的雷霆行动做铺垫、唤醒民意。

The bipartisan leaders echoed the previous assertion by the director of National Intelligence that China is the greatest threat to the democracy and freedom of the United States and the world since World War II. The joint statement said that the CCP would not give up its ambition to dominate the world and it has posed the greatest threat to the United States. This statement continues to prepare the ground and arouse public opinion for the upcoming thunderous action of the United States.

**蓬佩奥说中共国不是正常的政权**

**Pompeo said the CCP is not a normal regime**

过去数十年来世界所幻想的中共国经济繁荣会引领政治自由化的局面并没有出现；中共永远没有想过成为正常国家，因为其本质就不是一个正常的政权；这不是中美之间的战争而是自由与独裁的对抗；中共深思熟虑地布局与各国的经济往来，蒙蔽了世界几十年；请做对的事情。

The world’s fantasy over the past few decades that China’s economic boom would lead to political liberalisation is not materialised. The CCP never wanted to become a normal state because it is not a normal regime by its very nature. This is not a war between China and the United States but between freedom and dictatorship. The economic engagement with the rest of the world that the CCP deliberated to do has blinded the world for decades. Please do the right thing.

**FBI****正在调查来自加州的参议员范恩斯坦**

**The FBI is investigating Senator Feinstein of California**

FBI正在调查范恩斯坦，要求她交代其丈夫在COVID-19爆发前决定清仓股票的有关情况。该参议员与中共背景的所谓报业大亨方李邦琴来往密切，雇佣中共间谍司机长达五年。

The FBI is investigating Senator Feinstein for the decision of her husband to liquidate stocks before the COVID-19 outbreak. The senator had a close relationship with Fang Li Bangqin, a CCP-backed newspaper tycoon, and employed a CCP spy as her driver for five years.

**前空军中将麦金纳尼：美国必须立即进入国家紧急状态**

**The former air lieutenant general McInerney: The United States of America must immediately enter a state of emergency.**

必须立即执行2018年9月总统令，进入国家紧急状态；实施暴动法，防止Antifa的BLM骚乱；宣布戒严，暂停《人身保护令》，设立军事法庭；佩洛西和舒默都会被逮捕，我们确切知道谁在参与；川普总统注意安全。

The presidential decree of September 2018 must be immediately implemented to enter a state of emergency, implement the Riot Act to prevent BLM riots of Antifa, declare martial law, suspend habeas corpus, and establish military courts. Both Pelosi and Schumer will be arrested, we know exactly who involved. President Trump should take care of security.
