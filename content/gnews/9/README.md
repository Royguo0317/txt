Welcome back, as America undergoes historical political upheaval, our enemies are watching. China in particular, is mocking our internal unrest in its pursuit of world domination. But China has even greater problems than the United States, and they may be their own worst enemy. Dale Hurd explains.

欢迎回来，当美国经历历史性的政治动荡时，我们的敌人正虎视眈眈。特别是中[共]国，在追求称霸世界的同时嘲弄我们的国内动乱。但中[共]国面临的问题甚至比美国还大，他们很可能是自己最大的敌人。戴尔·赫德将为您解释。

To china, what happened at the capitol was a propaganda gift. The communist government-owned Global Times newspaper called it: “An iconic humiliation! The Madness of the capitol has dragged America to its waterloo!” Chinese commentators have had a field day, mocking what they call US hypocrisy, for supporting the sometime violent pro-democracy demonstration in Hong Kong.

对中[共]国来说，在国会发生的事情是一份送上门的宣传礼物。中共政府的口舌《环球时报》称其为：“标志性耻辱！ 国会山的疯狂把美利坚拖入滑铁卢！”中[共]国评论员们大肆炒作，嘲讽他们所谓的美国的虚伪，因美国支持了香港有时暴力的民主示威。

Meanwhile China has been busy, trying to show the world that it offers a better more stable and prosperous way, and that its economy has recovered from coronavirus while other nations are still stuck in lockdowns.

与此同时，中[共]国一直忙于向世界炫耀，它提供了一条更好、更稳定、更繁荣的道路，中[共]国的经济已经从冠状病毒疫情中恢复过来，而其他国家仍然处于封锁状态。

A New York Times writer even suggested China’s system is better than ours, saying: “Citizens of china don’t have freedom of speech… but they have the freedom to move around and lead a normal day-to-day life. In a pandemic year, many of the world’s people would envy this most basic form of freedom.” Michael Waller, an expert on propaganda and psychological warfare at the Center for Security Policy says: “This has been the public relation’s goal of the Chinese government since it first began to be blamed for Covid-19.

《纽约时报》的一位作者甚至认为中[共]国制度比我们的好，他说：“中[共]国公民虽然没有言论自由……但他们有四处走动的自由，过着正常的生活。在大疫之年，世界上许多人都会羡慕这种最基本形式的自由。”安全政策中心的宣传和心理战专家迈克尔·沃勒表示：“这一直是中[共]国政府自它最先因新冠病毒受到指责以来的公关目标。”

“Right now Xi Jingping is doing everything right, right now China have perfect stability, it’s the model for the world, and by the way, look at how bad the United States is.” But as it tries to overtake the United States and becomes the most powerful nation on earth, China has become its own worst enemy. Despite images like these, making it look like everything has returned to normal, China has not beaten coronavirus. A few days ago it had to seal off an entire city of 11 million people and ordered mass testing.

“现在，习近平做的每件事都是‘正确’的，现在中国拥有‘完美’的稳定，这就是世界的榜样，然后顺便看看美国有多糟糕。”但是，当中[共]国试图超越美国，成为世界上最强大的国家时，中[共]国已经成为自己最大的敌人。尽管有这样的宣传，使得看起来一切已经恢复正常，中[共]国还没有击败冠状病毒。就几天前，它不得不封锁整个1100万人口的城市，以进行大规模检测。

Long time China expert Steven Mosher: “I think that anything that comes out of china is either greatly exaggerated or it’s an out loud lie.”

资深的中[共]国问题专家史蒂芬·莫舍说：“我认为任何从中[共]国传出的消息，要么被大大夸大了，要么就是明目张胆的谎言。”

Shots like these are supposed to help you forget that China is one of the most brutal dictatorship in modern times. Millions of Muslim Uighurs have disappeared into Chinese internment camps, and Uighur women have subjected to forced abortion and sterilization. The Chinese embassy in Washington actually tweeted that this is good, because women are no longer baby-making machines.

这样的镜头意图使你忘记中[共]国是现代最残暴的独裁政权。数百万穆斯林维吾尔族人消失在中[共]国的集中营内，维吾尔族妇女被强迫堕胎和绝育。中[共]国驻华盛顿大使馆居然发推说，这是好事，因为女人们不再是制造婴儿的机器。

But China’s biggest obstacle to becoming the world’s superpower is simply: time. China is on track to be the first major economy that will grow old before it achieves widespread prosperity, because of its disastrous one-child policy. “China has killed off a half of the last two generations. 400 million Chinese, unborn Chinese were eliminated. They created a demographic trap for themselves and they are falling into it.” Because of aging, China will need to import foreign workers in 10 years. In 30 years one-third of its population will be elderly.

但中[共]国成为世界超级大国的最大障碍就是：时间。中[共]国很可能成为第一个在实现广泛经济繁荣之前就会老去的主要经济体，因为其灾难性的独生子女政策。“中[共]国把上两代人杀了一半。4亿未出生的中[共]国人被抹除了，他们给自己制造了一个人口结构陷阱，而且他们正在掉进这个陷阱里。”由于老龄化，10年内中[共]国将不得不引进外籍劳工。30年内中[共]国将有三分之一的人口成为老年人。

Chinese immigrant Helen Raleigh is the author of Backlash – How China’s Aggression Has Backfired. “The aging population that’s a huge issue. That’s why Xi feels like he really needs to hurry up.”

中国移民海伦·罗利是《反噬 – 中[共]国的侵略如何适得其反》一书的作者。“人口老龄化是个大问题，这就是为什么习近平觉得自己真的要抓紧了。”

In China’s race against time, president Xi has accelerated Chinese territory expansion, causing border disputes with most of its neighbors, and managing to turn them against China. “Xi is the most aggressive, most assertive Chinese leader since Chairman Mao. He is really a control freak, and he is power-hungry”

在中[共]国与时间赛跑的过程中，习主席加快了中[共]国领土扩张的步伐，导致与大多数邻国的边界争端，并使得这些邻国与中[共]国对立。“习是自毛主席以来最具侵略性、最强硬的中[共]国领导人。他真的是一个控制狂，而且他权欲熏心。”

China has moved big into Africa, becoming the biggest trading partner with Africa nations. But it’s sabotaging its own efforts by angering Africans with its deep-seated racism toward blacks. In this Chinese video, African children were tricked into saying in Chinese: “I am a black monster and I have a low IQ.” McDonald’s said that it’ll apologize after a restaurant posted this sign saying no blacks allowed. And this commercial from Chinese TV portrays a laundry detergent so strong, it can wash away the skin color of a black man.

中[共]国已经大举进军非洲，成为与非洲国家最大的贸易伙伴。但它对黑人根深蒂固的种族主义激怒了非洲人，从而破坏了自己的努力。在这段中文视频中，非洲儿童被骗用中文说：“我是黑鬼，智商低。”麦当劳曾在一家连锁店贴出这个写着黑人不得入内的牌子后道歉。在这个来自中[共]国电视的广告中，描绘了一种洗衣粉的强度之大，甚至可以洗掉一个黑人的肤色。

Chinese economic statistics are so untrustworthy that investment firms often use satellite images to find out the true state of the economy. “No responsible economist or investment professional will trust any official data out of China.” “The economic numbers out of china are… not a reflection of reality at all. The Chinese economy is in a recession, and the recession is getting deeper as we speak.”

中[共]国的经济统计数据非常不可信，投资公司往往通过卫星图像来了解真实的经济状况。“任何负责任的经济学家或投资专业人士都不会相信任何来自中[共]国的官方数据。”“中[共]国的经济数据…一点也不反映现实。中[共]国经济正陷入衰退，而且衰退的程度越来越深。”

Last year at the 70th anniversary of the founding of the China’s communist government, president Xi said: “No force can stop China.” But the Chinese government’s own policies are doing a pretty good job.

去年在中[共]国的共产党政府成立70周年之际，习主席说：“任何力量都无法阻止中国。”但中[共]国政府自己的政策却在这方面做得很不错。
