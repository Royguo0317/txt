1214晚间要闻-NewYork Time

**LuDe Media 20201214 Evening News, New York Time**

**麦康纳尔主动承认拜登当选引来嘘声一片**

**McConnell’s Active Recognition of Biden as President-elect Drew Boos**

参议院多数党领袖麦康纳尔1984年当选参议员以来，靠两面讨好、八面玲珑连任6届共36年。今天突然站出来挺拜登，意图在媒体上制造恐慌，打击川普，再次玩弄两面派手法。但美国人已经醒来。他的改口，立即引来班农在WarRoom的揭露和痛斥，其家族与中共勾兑的劣迹也很快在社交媒体上蔓延开来。麦康纳尔的花招不仅没有打击到川普，反而让爱国者们更加看清了沼泽地的黑暗，更加团结在一起。

Senate Majority Leader McConnell was elected to the Senate in 1984 and has served six consecutive terms for a total of 36 years by two-sided pleasing and being eight-faced. Suddenly he came out today to stand for Biden, and played a two-faced tactic again, intending to release panic in the media to strike Trump, but the Americans have woken up. His change in statements drew an immediate revelation and denunciation from Bannon at WarRoom, and the McConnell family’s vicious collusion with the Chinese Communist Party soon spread on social media. Instead of striking Trump, McConnell’s tricks made the patriots see the darkness of the swamp more clearly and unite more closely.

**川普律师Jenna Ellis发推：宪法规定1月6日选出新总统**

**Trump Attorney Jenna Ellis Tweeted: Constitution Requires New President to Be Elected on Jan. 6**

按照宪法规定，今天（15日）选举人团的票将被盖好章，通过特别承运人发送给华盛顿，到1月6日，再由众议院和参议院举行联合会议公开投票。媒体却一直试图让民众相信选举已经结束，拜登已经是当选总统。

届时，佩洛西将和其他众议员一样没有任何特权，参议院议长彭斯将拥有当天参议院的所有权力，决定谁是当选总统。如果有一名众议员提出异议，参众两院将进行辩论，然后由众议院按一州一票进行选举总统，参议院选副总统。目前共和党州与民主党州数量是30:20。

路德分析说，佩洛西很可能会在1月6日拖延会议的进程，以阻碍众议院如期选出新一届总统（川普）。

According to the Constitution, the Electoral College votes will be stamped today (15th) and sent to Washington via special carriers, and then the House of Representatives and the Senate hold a joint session for a public vote on Jan. 6. The media, however, has been trying to convince the public that the election is over and that Biden is already the president-elect.

Like the rest of the House, Pelosi will then have no privileges and Senate President Pence will have all the power of the Senate that day to decide who is president-elect. If one House member dissents, the House and Senate will debate and then the House will elect the president on a one-state, one-vote basis, and the Senate will choose the vice president. The current number of Republican states to Democratic states is 30:20.

LuDe analyzed that Pelosi is likely to delay the proceedings on Jan. 6, preventing the House from electing a new president (Trump) as scheduled.

**川普任命特别检察官来调查亨特拜登**

**Trump Appoints Special Prosecutor to Investigate Hunter Biden**

当初奥巴马任命特别检察官穆勒调查虚构的川普通俄门，组建了上百人的团队，花费3千万美元却一无所获。今天川普以同样招数回击民主党，区别在于，这次不是构陷，而是将以确凿证据在法律层面定罪亨特拜登。

When Obama appointed special prosecutor Mueller to investigate the fictional Trump Russia-gate, he assembled a team of more than a hundred members and spent $30 million but came up empty-handed. Today Trump hit back at the Democrats with the same tactic, the difference is that this time, instead of framing, he will convict Hunter Biden at the legal level with solid evidences.

**独立检察官具有法律赋予的特别权力**

**Independent Prosecutors Have Special Power Granted by Law**

独立检察官不能从现行检察和法院系统中挑选，只能从社会上挑选独立的法律界人士和法学家。他将具有超越总统的组织人事权、调查权、传讯权和特别诉讼权。如果没有极其严重的不正当行为、身体致残、丧失智力或者实际上损害其履行职务的其他情形，不得中途被免职。独立检察官的调查，不隶属于联邦检察系统、也不隶属于联邦法院系统。

The independent prosecutor could not be selected from the existing prosecutorial and court systems, but only from the community of independent members of the legal profession and jurists, and he will have powers of organization, personnel, investigation, subpoena and special litigation, which beyond those of the President. He may not be removed from office in the middle of the process without extremely serious misconducts, physical disabilities, loss of mental capacity or other circumstances that actually impair the performance of his duties. Investigations of the independent prosecutor are not subordinate to the federal prosecution systems or to the federal court systems.

**美空军成功实现无人机与战斗机的双向数据交互，引领空战新玩法**

**U.S. Air Force Successfully Realizes Two-Way Data Interaction Between Drones and Fighter Aircrafts, Leading New Way of Air Warfare**

美军的XQ-58女武神无人战机，在近期的正规演习任务中，与空军的F22和F35A和海军陆战队的F35B，成功实现了实时的数据切换、目标认证、侦察信号收集等作业。此次演习成功将开启美军“一架有人战机带领大批无人战机的新战法”。

Kratos XQ-58 Valkyrie, the U.S. Army’s unmanned combat aircraft, in a recent regular operation with the Air Force’s F22 and F35A and the Marine Corps’ F35B, successfully achieved real-time data switching, target authentication, reconnaissance signal collection and other missions. The success of this operation will open the U.S. military “a new warfare of a manned warplane to lead a large number of unmanned warplanes”.

**以色列中段反导系统拦截测试成功**

**Israeli Midcourse Anti-Missile System Intercept Test Successful**

以色列反导系统由地面拦截的铁穹系统、中段拦截的大卫弹弓系统和高空拦截的剑系统组成。

The Israeli ABM system consists of the Iron Dome system for ground-based interception, the David Slingshot system for mid-range interception, and the Sword system for high-altitude interception.
