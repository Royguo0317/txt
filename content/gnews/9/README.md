1212早间要闻-NewYork Time

**LuDe Media 20201212 Morning News, New York Time**

**巴尔隐瞒亨特拜登被调查的事实长达数月**

**Barr Hid the Fact that Hunter Biden Was Being Investigated for Months**

曼哈顿联邦检察官至少对亨特拜登进行税务欺诈调查了一年多，但司法部一直未对亨特拜登刑事起诉。亨特拜登的资金来源，也一直在接受调查。巴尔在大选前给司法部下达了指导性文件，要求不要透露有关调查的消息，以免影响大选。

Manhattan federal prosecutors have been investigating Hunter Biden for tax fraud for at least a year, but the Department of Justice has not criminally prosecuted Hunter Biden. The source of Hunter Biden’s funds has also been under investigation. Barr gave guidance to the Department of Justice not to disclose information about the investigation before the election so as not to influence the election.

**亨特拜登事件被隐瞒背后的深谋远虑**

**The Far-sightedness Behind the Concealment of Hunter Biden Case**

大选前如果巴尔爆出亨特拜登调查案，民主党会以“巴尔是川普提名的司法部长”为由，说川普搞政治陷害而轻松解套，丝毫不影响拜登选情。川普虽然一直说要调查亨特拜登，但并没有采取强硬措施，因为那样做的话，容易被政治对手扣上“通过司法手段干预大选、用政治手段进行陷害”的帽子。现在，这起在反川普地盘曼哈顿南区进行的、一直被巴尔隐瞒的、现在由偏左的华尔街日报爆出来的亨特拜登案，如果后期司法部迫于压力公布出全部真相，就没有人会质疑了。

川普要想在选情差距不是极其巨大的情况下确保大选胜利，就需要像NBA总决赛一样打到第七场甚至是加时赛，这就需要从一开始制定全面的应对措施，并按照计划一步步推进。

If Barr revealed the Hunter Biden investigation before the election, the Democrats would have used “Barr was nominated by Trump for Attorney General” as a reason to say that Trump had engaged in a political frame-up and would have easily dismantled it, without affecting Biden’s election campaign in any way. Although Trump has been talking about investigating Hunter Biden, but did not take strong measures, because that would be easily labelled “judicial interference in the election, using political means to frame” by political opponents. Now, this Hunter Biden case, which was conducted on anti-Trump territory——South Manhattan and has been concealed by Barr and is now being broken by the left-leaning Wall Street Journal, will not be questioned if the Department of Justice is pressured to release the whole truth at a later stage.

For Trump to secure a general election victory in the case of the electoral gap is not extremely huge, he needs to play to Game 7 or even overtime like the NBA Finals, which requires to develop a comprehensive response from the beginning, and follow the plan to move step by step.

**路德讲解美国的权力和中共的命运**

**LuDe Explains the Power of the United States and the Fate of the CCP**

美国的真正权力，存在于不需要走冗长法律程序就直接可以办成事的政府执法机构如可以直接抓人的各情报机构和ICE，和民间机构如美联储和Swift、Chips和Fedwire三大金融系统等。

以班农先生为代表的爱尔兰裔美国人天生勇敢、具有反抗精神，以发展实业为主，控制着美国的军队、情报机构和顶尖大学， 45位总统中有14名宣称自己是爱尔兰血统。以朱利安尼为代表的包括意大利、西班牙和葡萄牙语系的拉丁裔美国人势力集中在国土安全部、移民局尤其是移民及海关执法局（ICE），控制着美国的黑社会和地下力量。犹太裔美国人则控制着美国以及世界的金融体系。

这些族裔能够成为美国力量的一极，是因为在几百年的时间沉淀中，族裔内部建立起绝对的信任，拥有强大的凝聚力。对这些族裔来说，政治派别是表象，谁能维护其利益才是核心。

美国同意中共加入WTO就是给它机会建立信任，但短短20年时间已经证明中共不仅不值得信任，而且已危及到这些族裔的利益甚至安全，所以必须灭掉它。

The real power in the United States exists in law enforcement agencies of the government that can get things done directly without going through lengthy legal procedures, such as the various intelligence agencies and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that can arrest people directly, as well as private institutions such as the Federal Reserve and the three major financial systems, Swift, Chips and Fedwire.

The Irish-Americans, represented by Mr. Bannon, are naturally brave and rebellious, with a focus on developing industry, controlling the U.S. military, intelligence agencies and top universities, and 14 of the 45 presidents claiming Irish ancestry. Latino Americans, including Italian, Spanish and Portuguese speakers, represented by Giuliani, are concentrated in the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration Bureau, especially Immigration and Customs Enforcement （ICE）, and control the U.S. underworld and underground forces. Jewish-Americans, on the other hand, control the financial systems of U.S. and the world.

These ethnic groups have been able to become a pole of American power because of the absolute trust and strong cohesiveness built up within them over centuries. For these ethnic groups, political affiliation is superficial, and it is who can defend their interests that really matters.

The U.S. agreed to the CCP’s WTO membership to give it the opportunity to build trust, but in just 20 years it has been proven that the CCP is not only untrustworthy, but has endangered the interests and even the security of these ethnic groups, so it must be exterminated.

**香港政府暂停英航客机执飞伦敦至香港航班**

**Hong Kong Government Suspends Passenger Flights of British Airway from London to Hong Kong**

停飞日期是12日至25日，理由是在本周二的BA027航班上有4人确诊中共病毒，港府真实意图不得而知。

The flight suspension dates are from December 12 to 25, and the reason is that four people were diagnosed with the Chinese Communist virus on board flight BA027 on Tuesday, while the real intention of the Hong Kong government is not known.

**北京市政府发布新时代公民道德建设实施方案**

**Beijing Municipal Government Releases Implementation Plan for Civic Morality Construction in the New Era**

中共开始用所谓的道德赤裸裸绑架民众、控制其一言一行，可预见的人道灾难正在酝酿中。

The Chinese Communist Party has begun to use so-called morality to nakedly kidnap people and control their every word and deed, and a foreseeable humanitarian disaster is brewing.
